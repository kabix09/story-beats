# Story Beats

## Overview 
The goal of the competition is to predict the story beat of a scene in a given movie. According to Blake Snyder's Save the Cat! categorization, there are 15 possible story beats:

    1. Opening Image
    2. Theme Stated
    3. Setup
    4. Catalyst
    5. Debate
    6. Break Into Two
    7. B Story
    8. Fun and Games
    9. Midpoint
    10. Bad Guys Close In
    11. All is Lost
    12. Dark Night of the Soul
    13. Break Into Three
    14. Finale
    15. Final Image

The student's task is to create an algorithm that predicts one of these story beats based on scene stats and a subtitle file.

## Description 
The submissions will be evaluated using classification accuracy. To create a predictive model, students should use Python and scikit-learn (or any other applicable machine learning toolkit).

In addition to submitting their solution on this site, students are required to provide a link to reproducible code in the form of a Jupyter Notebook on the Course website. This project can be done in pairs.

## Authors
The notebook was prepared as part of the subject Advanced Data Mining, project number 2, project for a group of two people.
