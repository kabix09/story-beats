1
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:37,946
I get to work before the sun comes up
and I leave long after it's gone down.

2
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:42,519
I haven't had sex in six months
with someone other than myself.

3
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,417
And the only thing in my refrigerator
is an old lime.

4
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,319
Could be a kiwi. No way to tell.

5
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:50,586
Morning, Thomas.
Good morning, Nick. You better hurry.

6
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:52,286
But here's the thing:

7
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,089
This is just temporary.

8
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,524
Quick story:

9
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,432
My grandmother came to this country
with $20 in her pocket.

10
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,699
She worked hard her whole life
and never took shit from anyone.

11
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:09,142
When she died, she had
turned that $20 into $2000.

12
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:11,145
That sucks.

13
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:13,147
You know why she didn't succeed?

14
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,980
Because she didn't take shit
from anyone.

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,246
The key to success.....

16
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:20,647
They will not teach you this in business school.
......is taking shit.

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,890
That's what I have been doing the last
eight years, and it's all about to pay off.

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,086
This is Nick.

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,200
I am this close to getting a big promotion
with my own office.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,891
I will be right there, Mr. Harken.

21
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,369
Then all the endless hours,
and the sacrifice and the shit-eating...

22
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,802
...will have been worth it.

23
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,772
See, this is what concerns me, Nick.

24
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:42,708
You're a punctual guy. You know
the importance of being here right at 6 a.m.

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,678
Which is what leads me to think that...

26
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:48,944
...there must be something wrong
with the clock on our system.

27
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,451
May have been a minute late.

28
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:54,114
But according to this, you were
two minutes late. So either you're a liar...

29
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,990
...or this system is off by a full minute.

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,391
The only hitch?

31
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:02,794
I work for this guy, David Harken...

32
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:07,301
...who right now is giving me some
fresh shit for being two minutes late.

33
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,633
He's a total fucking asshole.

34
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:14,039
If that's the case, I am going to have to fire
Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

35
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,476
- I may have been two minutes late.
- Oh.

36
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,281
Well, then you were lying.

37
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,541
No. I..... Who you calling?

38
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,352
- Thomas. I got to let him go.
- No, uh.....

39
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,816
- I was lying. Sorry.
- Lying?

40
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:27,924
I didn't mean to. It was more of a saying.
"Might have been a minute late."

41
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:32,654
Literally, uh, truthfully,
was two minutes late.

42
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:37,531
Boy, I have to get used to driving
with this big, heavy ring on my finger.

43
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,068
- Come on.
- I keep swerving to the left, babe.

44
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:43,605
When I was a kid, people would
ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.

45
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,333
I always gave the same answer.

46
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,568
I love you so much.

47
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,234
I love you too.

48
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,744
I wanted to be a husband.

49
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:52,178
- I will call you when I am done.
- Have a good day.

50
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,612
I know that sounds weird.

51
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,982
Most boys want to be firehouse chiefs
or personal trainers...

52
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:00,420
...but to me being a husband
was, like, the highest calling.

53
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,717
And thanks to Stacy...

54
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,755
...that dream's about to come true.

55
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:08,422
Unfortunately, no one's going to pay you
to be a husband unless you marry Oprah.

56
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,396
So I had to find a job.

57
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,763
Now, I always admired dentists.

58
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:15,906
They're smart, they're capable,
they keep your teeth healthy.

59
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:18,668
So I went out and I became one.

60
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,011
- How are you today, Dale?
- I am fine. Thanks.

61
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,369
Excavator.

62
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, I became a dental assistant.
It's basically the same thing.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,413
I just make a lot less money.

64
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,646
Did you ever see that show Gossip Girl?

65
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,688
- No.
- Ooh.

66
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,792
I watched an episode last night.

67
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:40,096
I fingered myself so hard to that
Penn Badgley guy, I broke a nail.

68
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:43,324
And it would have been
the perfect job. If not for one...

69
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:47,904
...evil crazy bitch, D.D.S.

70
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:51,208
I bet you're no shrimp in
the cock department, huh, there, Dale?

71
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,671
- Okay, Julia. Come on.
- What?

72
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:55,836
- I am uncomfortable talking about that.
- Oh, Dale, come on.

73
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,446
You know that I like to fool around.

74
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,105
Oops.
Mr. Anderton.

75
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,851
Not in the office. This is bad.

76
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,817
- Bad, bad, bad.
- You probably shouldn't hit the patients.

77
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,188
Ah, I love this. So festive.

78
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:09,519
I love my job.

79
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,494
If you ask me, anyone who hates their job
has no one to blame but themself.

80
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,132
We make our own destinies,
and I have made a sweet one.

81
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,700
We have stairs.
You don't need to bring your own.

82
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,738
I am an account manager at a chemical
company. I will tell you, the job has its perks.

83
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:23,930
Hi, can I help you?

84
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,440
He's just signing for these packages.
Thank you.

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,771
Oh, no. I should do this.

86
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,412
Reggie, I got this. Thank you, buddy.

87
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:32,048
- This is high-priority stuff here.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:33,808
- So, what's going on here?
- I am sorry?

89
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,453
- Is this one of those hidden camera shows?
- What do you mean?

90
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,782
You're way too cute
to be just a FedEx girl.

91
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:41,515
You got to be a model or actress
or something, right?

92
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,889
What happens when I open these?
Something will jump out, bite my penis?

93
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,156
No. Nothing's going to jump out.
I am just a FedEx girl.

94
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,765
- Shut up.
- Ha, ha.

95
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,265
- Bye.
- Have a great afternoon.

96
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,458
Thank you.

97
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,435
I didn't sign that form, by the way,
so she has to come back.

98
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,629
She's cute, huh, Reg?

99
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,709
- Caught another fly in your web, did you?
- Ha, ha. Hey, Jack.

100
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,573
But the real reason I am here is this guy:

101
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:06,080
Jack Pellit, my boss.
The sweetest man I know.

102
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,278
He loves me and I love him.
Everybody loves him.

103
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:11,978
- You all right, Margie?
- Hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt.

104
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,249
I have been waiting to get in there
for a while.

105
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,825
- Who's in there?
- It's your son.

106
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,551
Bobby.

107
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,756
- Margie's waiting.
- You nearly done in there?

108
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,504
A man can't get any privacy around here.

109
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,264
- Okay, Margie. Bobby?
- What?

110
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,675
Your stomach okay? You seem
to spend more time on the toilet...

111
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:34,004
...than at your desk.

112
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:37,704
I didn't realize I had to tell you
every time I want to take a dump.

113
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,010
If the worst thing about this job
is having to tolerate my boss's...

114
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,882
...dipshit cokehead son,
well, it's a small price to pay.

115
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,682
Need me to tell you when I pee-pee?

116
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:50,191
I am just trying to get you to do
your part, son. It's not easy times.

117
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,693
I do my part. I do other people's parts.

118
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,800
But it doesn't matter to you. You just
want to ride my ass because I am your son.

119
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,768
You know what? I don't hear you
giving dickskin any shit.

120
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,872
"Dickskin"? Nice.
Kiss-ass.

121
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:05,030
Come on, come on.
Yeah, go on. In you go.

122
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,676
Get in the fucking.....

123
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,108
- I am a green belt, motherfucker.
- What?

124
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,305
Yeah. All right?
Okay.

125
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,713
Now, I know you have been working
your tail off for that promotion.

126
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,979
But I am not sure I can even consider...

127
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,215
...making you the senior vice president
of sales...

128
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,660
...if I can't trust you.

129
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:27,893
- You can trust me.
- Yeah, now you sound like my wife.

130
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,727
"Trust me. You can trust me, honey.

131
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,131
Nothing's happening behind your back.
Trust me."

132
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:36,273
Meanwhile, she's fucking
every guy in the neighborhood.

133
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,837
Oh, you want one?

134
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,574
It's 8:15 a.m.

135
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:45,272
Well, is there something wrong with
a man enjoying a drink in the morning?

136
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,321
No.

137
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,249
Thank you. Sure, thanks.

138
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,022
Bottoms up.

139
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,094
Nothing for you?

140
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,560
Nick, it's 8:15 in the morning.
I am not an alcoholic.

141
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,429
The only reason I took one,
I thought you were going to have one.

142
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,600
You took one because you thought I was?
Is that something a senior VP would do?

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,677
I was just trying to be polite.

144
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:18,508
So if I, uh, was going to put my balls
in honey and shaved coconut...

145
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:19,706
...you'd do that too?

146
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,180
- I would not.
- Sure?

147
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,718
- Yeah.
- Because I have got some coconut.

148
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:28,450
I am having my teeth whitened Tuesday. You
have to get your work done by Monday...

149
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,992
...which means you will probably
be here all weekend.

150
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,562
Look, if you want a promotion,
you got to earn it.

151
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,026
Now, what do I keep saying?

152
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:37,667
Life is a marathon,
and you cannot win a marathon...

153
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,100
...without putting a few Band-Aids
on your nipples, right?

154
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,830
Right.

155
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,066
Nick.

156
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,300
It's 18-year-old Scotch.

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,970
You don't really expect me to
pour it back into the bottle, do you?

158
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,055
- Water.
- Yep.

159
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,733
All right. Let's see if this thing's working.
Oh.

160
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,902
Oh, my God.
Oh. I am sorry. I am a squirter, Dale.

161
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,806
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

162
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:26,177
Ah. I think I can make out
our little friend right there.

163
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,373
Stop it.

164
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,118
- Somebody's circumcised.
- Okay.

165
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,114
- Listen.
- What?

166
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:37,226
- Can we stop doing this thing here?
- Why? Because you have a girlfriend?

167
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,189
She's not just my girlfriend anymore.
We're engaged now.

168
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,196
- What?
- We're engaged.

169
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,466
You said that she was
just a hole for your dick.

170
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,572
I never said that.

171
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,968
Not really my style.

172
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,501
Shut up.

173
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,377
That's a lot of gas.

174
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:59,641
- That's good. No, those are great ideas.
- Yeah?

175
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,875
- Put them down on paper, will you?
- Will do.

176
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,690
- You're happy here, aren't you?
- Yeah, of course.

177
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,590
Good.

178
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,521
You got a bright future here,
you know?

179
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,627
Someday soon,
it will be you running this place.

180
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,692
- See you, kid.
- All right, now.

181
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,701
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,469
Oh, shit.

183
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:28,839
He had a heart attack.

184
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,783
They said his, uh, heart burst in his 
chest like a water balloon.

185
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,777
Oh, my God. I am sorry, man.
I know you guys were close.

186
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,423
Yeah. Yeah, I loved that guy.

187
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:43,788
I loved working for him, you know?
It was, like, awesome.

188
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:46,589
Now his shitbag son's
going to be in charge and it's like....

189
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:47,787
The cokehead?

190
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,627
Yeah. Know how many times
I caught him doing blow at work?

191
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:54,965
This thing's a real bummer. Sorry. You're
the only one of us who didn't hate his job.

192
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:59,473
Did I tell you that Harken tricked me
into having a drink at 8:00 this morning?

193
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,269
I mean, I work for the Antichrist.

194
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,380
- How did he trick you?
- I thought he was giving you a promotion.

195
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,948
He is, definitely.
That's why he's being extra evil.

196
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:09,450
This is his last chance
to make my life miserable.

197
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,714
Right. At least your boss
isn't sexually harassing you.

198
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,687
- God. Here we go.
- Don't give me shit.

199
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,451
You won't get sympathy for this.

200
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:20,119
She's going crazy. It's like a totally
hostile work environment now, man.

201
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,730
- It's not funny.
- Yeah?

202
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,994
All right, today she starts spraying water
at my crotch to see the outline of my dick.

203
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:27,569
- That's great.
- It's not great.

204
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,730
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just, you know, fuck her?

205
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,537
Because I am engaged to be married
and I love my fiancee, okay?

206
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:35,735
That's true.

207
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,312
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

208
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:39,949
What about getting
a different dental hygienist job?

209
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,209
I can't get another job.

210
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,286
- No, he's a child molester, Nick.
- No, uh, deviant. Sexual deviant?

211
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,855
What is it? How do they classify it?
Sex offender.

212
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,821
I am on the registered
sex offender list, yes.

213
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,720
You can't get that expunged? All you did
was pull your dick out on a playground.

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,162
I was taking a piss at night,
there were no kids.

215
00:10:56,162 --> 00:11:00,633
All right, you know what? You don't
put a playground right next to a bar.

216
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,328
It's entrapment.
Mm-hm.

217
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,367
Speaking of entrapment, I am going to go
see that girl about her vagina.

218
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,145
Excuse me.

219
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,311
He did say 10:00, right?

220
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:19,450
- Yeah. Do you know what this is about?
- It just said "staff meeting" on the memo.

221
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,117
It's funny how he gets all over my ass if I am
a minute late, but then he makes us wait 15.

222
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,990
You were two minutes late.
Morning.

223
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,461
Didn't think I had to punch a clock
with you.

224
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,896
I will just attribute this
to your drinking problem.

225
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,730
- I don't have.....
- Please, we're in the middle of a meeting.

226
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,066
Morning, everyone.
So I have finally decided...

227
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:43,405
...who I want to be our new
senior vice president of sales.

228
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,814
He's right here in this room.

229
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,115
- It's me.
- What'd he say?

230
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,553
I have decided to absorb
the responsibilities...

231
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,387
...of the senior VP position
into my own.

232
00:11:57,387 --> 00:12:01,156
I have realized if you want to get something
done right, you got to do it yourself.

233
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:05,496
I will break through the wall of the office
that would have been the senior VP's...

234
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:07,796
...and make one huge, enormous office.

235
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:13,239
However, I will only be taking 85 percent
of the additional salary I am entitled to...

236
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:16,311
...and that is self-sacrifice, people.
Learn from it.

237
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,913
Fucker.

238
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,915
You fucking son of a bitch.

239
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,655
You are so fucking fired.

240
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,026
Yeah.

241
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,193
So, meeting adjourned.

242
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,699
- Can I speak to you?
- Sure, what is it?

243
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:43,806
For months you have been hinting
I was in line for that promotion.

244
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,942
And look how hard you have been working.

245
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,009
- You were just lying to me?
- Lying?

246
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,671
No, Nick, motivating.

247
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,511
I mean, look, we're all
part of the same team here.

248
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:57,916
Plus, you know, I am the one
who's going to be doing all the extra work.

249
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,249
You know last month
you made me work so late...

250
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:03,086
...I missed saying goodbye
to my Gam Gam?

251
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,494
- Sorry, what?
- My grandmother.

252
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,292
I told you I needed to see her
because she was very sick.

253
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,331
You said if I left early, I'd get fired.

254
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,595
And she died
before I made it to the hospital.

255
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,567
- I am sorry.
- Thank you.

256
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:22,173
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

257
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,147
I am sorry. I am sorry.

258
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,487
I am sorry you didn't get to
say bye-bye to Gam Gam.

259
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:34,055
Really, I really am. I am sorry.

260
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:38,888
But I needed you to work late because you
are an invaluable member of this operation.

261
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:41,088
And I need you in the position you're in.

262
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, tough shit, okay?

263
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:49,562
Been in that position for eight years. Why
would I stay after being treated like this?

264
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,767
Well, because I'd make sure that nobody
in the industry would ever hire you again.

265
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,070
Bullshit.

266
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,612
No, because they're going to want
my letter of recommendation, right?

267
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:04,379
So I am perfectly willing to write that
you are an insubordinate, dishonest drunk.

268
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,750
You can't do that. That's not true.

269
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:14,290
Let me tell you something,
you stupid little runt.

270
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,057
I own you.

271
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:17,666
You're my bitch.

272
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,861
Don't walk around thinking
you have free will because you don't.

273
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,404
I can crush you any time I want.

274
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:28,736
So settle in because you are here
for the long haul.

275
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,429
Yo, dickwall.

276
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,491
- What the fuck?
- What?

277
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,930
Three hours late. What's the deal?

278
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,499
- I was at your father's funeral.
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

279
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,631
Maybe that excuse would have flown when
my dad was here, but I am in charge now.

280
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,574
That excuse wouldn't make any sense
if your dad was still here.

281
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:04,304
Whoa.

282
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,471
In my office, now.

283
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,243
Yes?

284
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,646
All right, sit.

285
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,314
- I am not a dog, Bobby.
- Good boy.

286
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,723
I have been looking through the books.
You're the accountant. Tell me...

287
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:21,626
....why is this company in the crapper?
Well, we're not.

288
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:24,563
- It's a recession, but we're still profitable.
- Bullshit.

289
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,168
Look...

290
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,365
...I know you and my dad were, uh, pals.
Okay?

291
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:33,408
Frankly, I always thought
it was a little bit weird and gay.

292
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,909
I have no idea why he thought
you were so fucking special.

293
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,341
But that doesn't matter now,
he's in the ground.

294
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:41,347
I am your boss. And there's going to be
some changes around here.

295
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,611
- Can't wait to hear them.
- First things first.

296
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,551
EnviroTech Waste Management.
It's costing us a lot of money.

297
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:49,157
Your dad chose to dispose
of our waste responsibly.

298
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,987
To do that, you got to spend money.

299
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,993
Bolivians will do it for a third
of the price. I will hire them.

300
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,426
- You can't go to them.
- Why?

301
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,567
They're going to endanger
local residents.

302
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,999
Oh, I give a fuck some tribesman
gets cancer. Cry me a fucking river.

303
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,002
They're not tribesmen.
It's a modern society.

304
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,572
Do I look like I fucking care?

305
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,209
Your dad told me very clearly
he would rather die...

306
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,242
...than save money
and hurt people, okay?

307
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,939
Well, guess what, looks like
we're right on schedule, doesn't it?

308
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,315
What else? Got to trim
some of the fat around here.

309
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,580
What do you mean by "trim the fat"?

310
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,984
- I want you to fire the fat people.
- What?

311
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:23,683
They're lazy, and slow
and they make me sad to look at.

312
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,023
You can start with Large Marge.
Marge, can you come in here, please?

313
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:30,189
No, Margie's not fat, she's pregnant.
I am not going to fire her.

314
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,766
Well, fine. Uh...

315
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:34,426
...stay where you are, Marge.
Congratulations.

316
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,069
- You can fire, uh, Professor Xavier.
- Who are you talking about?

317
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,777
- You mean Hank?
- Yeah.

318
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:45,176
He creeps me out, rolling around
all day in his special secret chair.

319
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:47,374
- He's up to something.
- I won't fire anyone.

320
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,576
- You're not? Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

321
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,187
It's like you don't care
about this company at all.

322
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:55,882
No fucking shit I don't care about
this company. This is just an ATM to me.

323
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,517
You think when I was a kid I dreamed
of running a fucking chemical company?

324
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:03,757
No. I dreamed of being on a beach
with a model serving me tropical drinks.

325
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,459
That's what I dreamed of.
That's what's going to happen...

326
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,335
...as soon as I squeeze the profit out
of this company. But first things first.

327
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:15,572
You either fire the fatty or you
fire the cripple, or I fire all three of you.

328
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,047
Do the math.

329
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,615
One loses the job or three loses it.

330
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:25,379
And tell him to leave his handicap
parking pass here as well.

331
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,514
Come in.

332
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,018
Julia, you needed to see me?

333
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,388
Oh, shit.

334
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,159
Uh-oh.

335
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,028
- Will you have a seat, Dale?
- Do I have to?

336
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,031
Please.

337
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,375
Sure.

338
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,749
This is a little ridiculous, but.....

339
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:59,514
Look, Dale, you know, I know that
I like to fool around at work. Right?

340
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:02,955
And I might even..... You know,
I might even cross the line a bit.

341
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:06,755
But the last thing that I want to do
is make you uncomfortable.

342
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,894
I mean, it's just not professional.
You know?

343
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:13,434
And I pride myself
on being a professional.

344
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:18,200
So from now on, what I would like you
to do is just tell me, you know...

345
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,708
...when and if, uh, I cross the line. Okay?

346
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,312
Okay. Now.

347
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:25,839
What?

348
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,508
Well, now,
you're kind of crossing a line...

349
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,753
...because you're naked.

350
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:33,446
Uh....

351
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,022
Not naked, Dale.

352
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,355
- Can you see my pussy?
- Hmm.

353
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,990
True. Um....

354
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,899
But I think, uh, even really
saying the word "pussy" is....

355
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:50,061
- That's crossing the line?
- Little bit.

356
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,333
You're starting to sound like
a little faggot.

357
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:56,206
There we go. That one's another one,
probably illegal thing to say too.

358
00:18:56,206 --> 00:19:01,442
Okay. Let's not talk about illegal,
Mr. I-Like-To-Pee-On-Little-Boys.

359
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:04,143
It was an empty playground
in the middle of the night.

360
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,721
Ah. That's weirder. Poor child
must have been terrified.

361
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:10,121
There were no children. No kids in the park.
Why do people think that?

362
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:14,491
You know what? Forget it. Listen,
let's just cut to the chase, all right, mister?

363
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,599
- You're engaged now.
- Right.

364
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,329
And I respect the institution of
marriage way too much to violate it.

365
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:25,540
So that's why you're going to have to
fuck me well before the wedding.

366
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:30,443
Because the closer we get to this date,
the less ladylike I am going to feel about it.

367
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:32,945
Julia, I am not going to sleep with you.

368
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,515
We will see about that.

369
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,359
Get out.

370
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,063
Could you do the, uh...?

371
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,303
I am a sucker.
Harken wasn't going to promote me.

372
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:57,167
That coked-up prick
is going to ruin Pellit Chemicals.

373
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,204
He's just going to fire everybody.

374
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:02,345
She stood there with her breasts
right in my face.

375
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:04,639
Yeah, you know,
yours doesn't sound that bad.

376
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,373
I will stop bringing it up.

377
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,609
I don't understand
why you guys don't quit.

378
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,220
Julia's the only one who'd hire me.
Are you registered sex offenders?

379
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,291
Going to school, changing fields, starting
from the bottom. Who wants to do that?

380
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:20,419
What do I care about protecting
Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?

381
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,657
- Got to be a million jobs out there.
- You could find another job.

382
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,268
Is this really happening? Look at this.
Oh.

383
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,871
The Three Musketeers. Nick, Kurt and Dale.
Look, hanging like high school.

384
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,634
Oh, shit. Kenny's here.
What's up?

385
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,933
- Yeah, I love this.
- Kenny Sommerfeld.

386
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,239
In the flesh, boys.
Oh, my goodness.

387
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,906
Now, I heard you moved to New York,
you're working at Lehman Brothers.

388
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,780
- They, uh, hired me right out of Yale.
- What are you doing here?

389
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,253
You read the papers? They shut us down.
Right. Sorry about that.

390
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,722
I have been looking for work
for the last two years.

391
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,918
I can't even get a job waiting tables.

392
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,426
Ah, you know what, though?

393
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,963
I would fucking murder those
Lehman Brothers if I could.

394
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,156
Yeah, I hear you.

395
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,233
Ha. I can't even pay
for this fucking drink.

396
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,767
Well, we will cover it, right?

397
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,769
Seriously, uh, you guys think
you could help me out a little?

398
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,102
- Beyond the drink?
- Maybe some extra scratch, if you got it.

399
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:10,542
Of course. Kenny, I had no idea
it was that bad, buddy. All I got's 15.

400
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,046
Do you have change for a 10?
No, I don't.

401
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,549
You know what? That's probably
not going to cut it, so I will tell you what.

402
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,585
How about I give you guys
some hand jobs?

403
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,347
Do what?
Forty bucks apiece.

404
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,287
We could do it here in the bathroom.

405
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:24,654
- No thanks.
- That's a joke? You're joking?

406
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,886
- Kenny.
- Hey.

407
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,529
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

408
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,358
I told you no more handies in here.

409
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:32,161
You guys change your minds,
I am staying at my mom's house.

410
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,358
Okay.

411
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,633
Maybe don't quit your job.

412
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:42,007
I guess we will be miserable
for the rest of our lives? That's the deal?

413
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,647
- That's the way it's looking.
- Why you saying that?

414
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:46,441
We don't have many options, do we?

415
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,547
Think about it, we can quit our jobs
and turn into Kenny...

416
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:52,984
...or, uh, keep our jobs
and just become spineless losers...

417
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:56,353
...that spend their entire day
dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.

418
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:58,118
- You do that too?
- Of course.

419
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,423
- Sounds a little sick.
- It's not. It's just a way to blow off steam.

420
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,930
It's not like we're going to
actually kill our bosses.

421
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,568
- Good.
- Ha, ha. Though you would have to admit...

422
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:09,796
...that our lives would be a lot easier
if our bosses weren't alive.

423
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,996
Mm-hm.

424
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,770
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

425
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,746
- No.
- I would.

426
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:19,279
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

427
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,711
- You would?
- Yeah.

428
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:24,183
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

429
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:25,685
I can't wait to hear this.

430
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,552
If one evil person dies
for the greater good, so be it.

431
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:32,889
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute
monster. He's a fucking jerk.

432
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:37,397
If he has his way, he's going to end up
killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

433
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,590
What?

434
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,066
Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

435
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:44,139
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

436
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:46,275
Yes. Yes, you should.

437
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,275
But I don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.

438
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,937
Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

439
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,811
- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

440
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:58,352
- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

441
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:00,250
You're right.
Uh, know what I am going to do?

442
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,051
I am going to go to Julia's house,
maybe I will slash her up...

443
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:06,821
...and I will put her in a box and I will mail
it to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

444
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:10,797
I am done with this conversation. You're
paying for dinner because you have upset me.

445
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,494
You're paying
and I am finding a cab somehow.

446
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,265
I was just speaking hypothetically,
you know.

447
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,169
Me too.

448
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,307
Guess who.

449
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:27,075
Look, I am really kind of
not in the mood for this.

450
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,808
Not in the mood for what?

451
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,244
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

452
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,978
Oh, what are you doing here?

453
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,181
- I invited her.
- Yes. She called.

454
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:39,761
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

455
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,899
- And you know I have that loose filling.
- Yeah.

456
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,056
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

457
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,669
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy,
it's my pleasure.

458
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,327
You're part of the family now.

459
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,646
But, um, I don't know
if it's a good idea, sweetie.

460
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,545
Oh, why not?

461
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:06,086
Because we're mixing pleasure
with business. Business and pleasure.

462
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:07,848
We're taking advantage of Julia.

463
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,920
Dale.

464
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,961
There's nothing that you could do ever
that would be taking advantage of me.

465
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,930
- Okay?
- So sweet.

466
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,569
All right, you. Let's go say
we pump you full of gas, huh?

467
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,971
- Okay.
- Okay.

468
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,343
Fuck me.

469
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,632
Ten.

470
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,278
Nine.

471
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,643
I don't know
what you're doing with your hand.

472
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,252
- Okay.
- Seven.

473
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:40,946
Put your hand in a safe place
because there's sharp tools here.

474
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,550
Oh, there she goes.

475
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,725
- Come here.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

476
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,624
You're going to give me that dong, Dale.

477
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:51,992
My dong?

478
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,102
You're going to fuck my slutty little mouth.

479
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:57,467
Do you hear the words you say sometimes?
I mean, who talks like that?

480
00:24:57,467 --> 00:25:00,199
Let's have sex on top of her.
Let's use her like a bed.

481
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,510
Get down, get down. Hey, hey.
Get off of her.

482
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,878
Goddamn you. That's it, okay?
You know what? That's crossing the line.

483
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:09,541
So I am done, Julia.

484
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,314
Fuck this. I am out. I don't need this job.
So goodbye, I am quitting. I am done.

485
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:15,116
I am going to tell her you fucked me.

486
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,882
What?

487
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,824
If you don't fuck me,
I am going to tell her that you fucked me.

488
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,496
Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want.
She's not going to believe you.

489
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,798
She already knows
that you're a sex offender.

490
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:30,205
And I think once she gets a look
at these...

491
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,975
...she's going to believe me.

492
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,438
- What is that?
- Do you remember your first week here?

493
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:38,877
When I changed the crown
on your second bicuspid?

494
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:40,175
Yeah.

495
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,850
Well, I just, uh, took a few pictures
of the procedure.

496
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,920
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

497
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,481
Oh, no. What?

498
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,953
Oh. Ooh.

499
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,892
You did all this
while I was unconscious?

500
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:56,964
Ooh. Mm-hm. Yep.

501
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,631
That's my favorite.

502
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:01,827
- Rape.
- What?

503
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,200
Rape. That's a rape.
This is what raping is.

504
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,933
You're a raper and you have raped me.
That's a rape. Rape.

505
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,544
Just relax there, Jodie Foster.

506
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,479
Your dick wasn't even hard.

507
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,377
That does not give me any relief.

508
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:16,246
But it will be next time, and if it is not...

509
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:20,947
...this little sweetheart right here is going 
to get a peek at my little photo album.

510
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:27,087
So please prep the patient
for the bitewing X-ray.

511
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,596
I will be back in a jiffy.

512
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,668
I am in. Let's kill this bitch.

513
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:47,177
What bitch?
"What bitch"? Guys, my boss.

514
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:50,615
Our bosses need to die. You were right,
man. We should do this thing.

515
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:53,813
We were drinking last night.
You said that killing is wrong.

516
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:58,222
I know. That was before Julia tried to fuck
me on top of Stacy's unconscious body.

517
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,520
- Really?
- Yes, dude.

518
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,063
She's gone fucking batshit crazy.
She took a bunch of photographs of me....

519
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:05,895
- Where are they?
- They will ruin my life. I can't show them.

520
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,936
- It's a whole thing. You guys in or out?
- I was in last night.

521
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:11,130
- Nick, what do you say?
- Please. Let's go.

522
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,330
Nick, come on.

523
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,740
Seriously. I mean, uh, what about
your grandma, you know? Bubbe.

524
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,208
- Gam Gam.
- Whatever it is.

525
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,473
She didn't get to say goodbye
to her grandson.

526
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:22,481
Because his dickbag of a boss
wouldn't let him leave. Right?

527
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:25,917
- What would Gam Gam want you to do?
- She wouldn't want me to kill him.

528
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:28,990
Okay, forget about Gam Gam.
She's dead. You got to accept that.

529
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,991
This is about you, Nick.
Okay, what do you want?

530
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,054
Well, obviously I want him gone.

531
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,061
- Exactly. So let's do this.
- Right?

532
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,431
How do we do this?
I thought about that.

533
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:40,569
Stacy and I,
we watch a ton of Law & Order.

534
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:43,797
There's all sorts of ways the bad
guys on the show mess up, right?

535
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:47,067
They leave behind skin cells
and, uh, bullet casing.....

536
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,266
Sperm.

537
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,537
- Most of the time, it's sperm.
- Silent killer.

538
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,578
Anyway, that's not the point.
Point is...

539
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:55,217
...we're not qualified.
We got to hire a professional.

540
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:57,250
- Are you talking about a hit man?
- Yeah.

541
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,115
That's a really good idea.

542
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:02,087
Yeah. We don't clean
our own apartments or cut our own hair.

543
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:03,850
- No, we pay someone to do that.
- Yeah.

544
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,926
Uh, where are you two
going to find a hit man?

545
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:08,222
Why don't you guys
leave that up to me, okay?

546
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,662
I got this whole thing figured out.

547
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:15,327
I am going to give you a call tomorrow,
I am going to tell you where to meet me.

548
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,063
Why don't you just tell us now?

549
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,368
- Because I don't have it figured out.
- Ah.

550
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,970
But I will.

551
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,633
- Were you followed?
- Why would I be followed?

552
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:47,929
People follow people in these types
of situations. Sure you weren't?

553
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:49,127
Oh, boy. What people?

554
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,432
Just take one quick look around,
make sure.

555
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:54,008
- Let's put this down.
- Look around, make sure some.....

556
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:55,906
- Calm down.
- That's what you get.

557
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,343
Shut the door, take the chain off
and let me in.

558
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,413
- I pissed him off already.
- Already?

559
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,553
What the hell's going on, huh?
What are we doing here?

560
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:08,782
- I don't want an assassin in my apartment.
- Don't want this guy knowing where we live.

561
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:12,484
Hang on, you guys already went ahead
and found someone that's coming here?

562
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,926
- Oh, bigtime.
- Not "we." Dale, all by himself.

563
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:18,760
- It was easy. Easy as buying a used futon.
- You found a hit man online?

564
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,369
Yeah. They don't write "hit man,"
right? That's dumb.

565
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:24,972
They use code words, like wet work,
right? Liquidation. Check him out.

566
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,405
"Skilled professional
with years of experience...

567
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:29,567
...in domestic and international
wet work.

568
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,839
Discreet. No children,
no political figures."

569
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,374
That last part was important. I saw that,
I thought, "This is a good idea."

570
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,376
I feel we should have got
a cheese plate for this guy.

571
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,782
- 20/20 hindsight.
- Is that him?

572
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:42,652
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, that was definitely a car.

573
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:49,664
- He looks like James Bond.
- He really does, dude.

574
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:53,791
Bet he carries a gun you screw together.
Those are, like, the coolest guns they make.

575
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,199
So dangerous.
What if that is an undercover cop?

576
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,896
- Come on.
- What if it's the real thing?

577
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,043
He charges so much we can't
afford it, gets pissed, kills us.

578
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:03,109
- Kills all three of us? Hold on.
- That's a thing?

579
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,302
Could that happen?

580
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,978
- Got to let him in.
- How's my hair?

581
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:10,210
- What do you mean?
- It doesn't matter. Let's do this. Okay.

582
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,910
Ready?

583
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,155
Yeah?

584
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,486
Are you Dale?

585
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,400
- I am the one they call Dale.
- Hmm.

586
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,634
Please come in.

587
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,638
Thank you.

588
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,506
Are all three of you participating in this?

589
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:37,771
- Yes.
- Well, um....

590
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,812
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep.
- Yes.

591
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,608
Very well.

592
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:44,480
Now, before we go any further...

593
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,112
...I need to know if there are
any hidden recording devices in the room.

594
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,225
I will find out if there are.

595
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,988
I am sure you would, but there's none
because that would be stupid of us.

596
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,222
- That's a silly move.
- It's a no.

597
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,000
Then let's get started.

598
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,337
- I love this guy.
- This is the real deal.

599
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:06,497
- His voice, you kidding?
- This guy is legit.

600
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,941
And you do know that
we just want to start with a.....?

601
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, what's this for?

602
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,882
- For the mess.
- What?

603
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:16,643
Wouldn't want to leave a stain, now.

604
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:18,809
- Oh, my God. I knew it.
- Who's first?

605
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,320
- "Who's first"? No.
- We don't want you to kill us.

606
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,619
We want you to kill another person.
If anyone's first, probably him.

607
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,817
No. Goddamn it.

608
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,463
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what are you talking about?

609
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,399
Your ad said you do wet work.

610
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,695
That's correct.
I urinate on other men for money.

611
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,403
- What was that?
- What'd he say?

612
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:38,198
I think he said he pisses on dudes.

613
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,003
Why else do you think my ad was
in the "men seeking men" section?

614
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,469
Where was it?

615
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,512
- You fucking idiot.
- Could you be dumber?

616
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:49,879
Why look in the men seeking men.....?
We are men looking for a man.

617
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:51,986
How do people
let you work on their teeth?

618
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:54,623
They don't, actually.
I just hand the tools to Julia.

619
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:59,091
Are you telling me that I have driven all this
way and nobody wants to get pissed on?

620
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,752
- Uh-uh.
- Well, it's not our thing.

621
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,953
Sorry about that.

622
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,464
Can I use your toilet? I stored up
rather a large amount of pee for this.

623
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:08,399
Sure. Yeah, it's right through there.
Knock yourself out.

624
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,403
Oh, and by the way,
I still will want my $200.

625
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:12,870
- Understandable.
- We insist.

626
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,306
- Two hundred, huh? A bargain.
- To kill three people?

627
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:17,537
- I thought it was such a good deal.
- Dipshit.

628
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:21,274
- Reflects poorly on me that you're my friend.
- Hear what's going on in there?

629
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,850
That was almost all over us.

630
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,351
Okay, I am going to
take the blame on that one.

631
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:32,050
- You bet your ass you will.
- You should take the blame.

632
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,060
- It was an honest mistake.
- That's not how you find a killer.

633
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,756
- Oh, you know how to find a killer?
- Yeah, I bet I.....

634
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,198
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Yeah. I got an idea.

635
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:41,461
What are you doing?

636
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,660
What are you doing?

637
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,073
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.

638
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:47,205
Thank you for contacting Nav Guide.
My name is Gregory.

639
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:49,105
How may I be of service this evening?

640
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:53,146
Yeah, we're looking for the most dangerous
bar in the city. Can you help us, please?

641
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,181
- We're going to dinner.
- I am sorry?

642
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,843
Looking for a bar filled with criminals.
Lowlife thugs, hard-core shitheads.

643
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,353
- What do you got for us?
- Let's go to a restaurant.

644
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:05,221
I am afraid our listings
are not organized by danger, sir.

645
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:08,363
I see there's an Applebee's
three blocks from your location.

646
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,055
- Perfect.
- No, not really helpful.

647
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,895
They're not the kind of shitheads
we need. Anything else?

648
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:14,934
I could direct you
to a neighborhood...

649
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,765
...with the greatest
number of carjackings.

650
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:19,737
- Now we're thinking outside the box.
- I want to go to dinner.

651
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:21,399
- Love it.
- That's probably right.

652
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,774
Very good, sir.
You may wish to lock your doors.

653
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,620
- This is worse than getting pissed on.
- Shh.

654
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,779
- I'd rather be pissed on.
- Jesus.

655
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:38,654
You weren't kidding, Gregory.
This is, uh, a bad part of town.

656
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:41,126
You can stay on the line.
You're still there?

657
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:44,266
- I am still here, sir.
- Just keep, uh, keep us on the line.

658
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:47,766
I am always curious about these things,
but is your real name Gregory?

659
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:52,032
Uh, no, sir. My real name is Atmanand.

660
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,504
How do you get Gregory from that?

661
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:56,008
Oh. Gregory was assigned to me...

662
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:58,669
.....by Nav Guide.
Why not let you use your real name?

663
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,045
They say many Americans
find our real names hard to pronounce.

664
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:04,186
I am not going to play
by their rules anymore.

665
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:06,378
From now on,
I am going to call you Ahmenan.

666
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,455
- Atmanand.
- Ammenand.

667
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:10,421
- Atmanad.
- Atmanand.

668
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:13,061
I am going to call you Gregory,
that name's a nightmare.

669
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,390
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, boy.

670
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,260
- You hurt his feelings.
- I didn't.

671
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,423
You have arrived at your destination, sir.

672
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:22,935
- All right. Well, thanks, Gregory.
- You're welcome.

673
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:31,744
All right. All right, here we go.

674
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,480
- This is a really bad idea.
- This is a great idea.

675
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,812
Going to yell "anybody here kill for money"?
No.

676
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:40,216
- That's a terrible plan.
- Follow me. I got this.

677
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:42,789
- Where you going?
- I don't feel we should stay.

678
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,551
All right.

679
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,757
- Bowflex?
- Shut up.

680
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:52,572
Ah.

681
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,762
My man.

682
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,301
Hey, uh, does anyone here
kill people for money?

683
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,966
- Kurt.
- The fuck you just say?

684
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,543
No, it's not a race thing.

685
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:07,012
Uh, I believe that society discriminates
and disenfranchises you folks.

686
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:08,377
- "You folks"?
- Subtle.

687
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:12,146
Man, I am a small-business owner.
Who the hell you calling disenfranchised?

688
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:14,448
Well, not you in particular,
in that instance.

689
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,388
- Oh, right. You mean all black people.
- Yes.

690
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:19,721
- I am going to be in the car.
- Oh, a baseball bat.

691
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:23,057
Uh, I didn't mean to offend you.
I am sorry if that's what happened.

692
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:25,063
My heart's in the right place.

693
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:27,793
In five seconds, your heart
going to be in the wrong place.

694
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,632
- Four, three, two, let's roll.
- Got it. Okay. Take care.

695
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,432
Have a nice day. Good day to you.

696
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,371
Bye, baby.

697
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,310
Don't say a word. I know, I know.

698
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,074
Hit the button. Hit the button.

699
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:44,077
- Guys, I don't know. Should we quit?
- Yo. Yeah, definitely.

700
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:47,146
- Think I can help you boys.
- Is that for us?

701
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,847
- Here we go.
- Not interested, thank you.

702
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,049
Hey, hey, hey.

703
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,555
Let's follow a strange guy
into a dark corner.

704
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:03,261
Somebody said you all looking
for somebody to help with business.

705
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,636
- Yep.
- Well, um...

706
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,538
....are you a businessman?
Yeah.

707
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,178
Motherfucker Jones.

708
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,078
- How's that?
- Motherfucker Jones.

709
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,217
Your first name is "Motherfucker"?

710
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,445
Last name Jones.
You got a problem with that?

711
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:24,116
No. No. Cool name. Yeah. Is that,
like, on your birth certificate too?

712
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,624
No, goofball.

713
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,856
My real name is Dean.

714
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:30,726
Dean Jones. Same name of
the actor in Herbie, the Love Bug.

715
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,094
He won't know who that is.

716
00:36:32,094 --> 00:36:34,293
- I know who he is, bitch.
- Sorry.

717
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:38,065
I can't walk around in this fucking
neighborhood with that Disney-ass name.

718
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,100
How'd you get the name
Motherfucker?

719
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,403
When I was a kid, I snuck
into my mother's bedroom.

720
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:43,806
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh.

721
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,378
- She was laying there naked.
- Dean.

722
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:47,277
- She had been drinking all night.
- We get it.

723
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:50,578
And then I snuck up behind her,
and then I slipped my fingers...

724
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,454
....into her purse.
Purse? He said "purse."

725
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:57,683
I took her money, the whole week's
pay. I really fucked her over.

726
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:01,159
And that's how I got the name
Motherfucker Jones.

727
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,353
Right.

728
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,500
They should call you Motherfucker-Over
Jones to avoid confusion.

729
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,795
- What's the confusion?
- There's no confusion.

730
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:11,098
We're going to get back on track here.
Sir, we each have a boss, uh...

731
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,296
...that, you know.....

732
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,411
There's three bosses, and it would be best
if those bosses maybe were no longer....

733
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,739
- No longer around anymore.
- We want them...

734
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:22,008
You know?
...killed.

735
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,144
You got the cheese?

736
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,351
We got the cheese.
What kind of cheese are you thinking?

737
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,220
- What is that, three hits? That's....
- Yeah.

738
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:35,793
- Thirty large.
- Whoa.

739
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:38,160
- Hungry.
- That's a lot of cheese.

740
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,460
Oh, here's an idea.

741
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,399
If you kill two, could we get
the third one hold the cheese?

742
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:45,768
It's no negotiations.
Thirty large or nothing.

743
00:37:45,768 --> 00:37:49,376
- That's more cheese than we have got.
- Okay, then. It's five large now.

744
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,872
Then.... Then we're in. 
We're in. We're in. Right?

745
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,144
Hang on. Wouldn't it be awful
if it was traceable back to us?

746
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,685
I don't even know your names.

747
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,754
- That is rude. This is Dale.
- Don't say my name.

748
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:05,792
Shut the fuck up. Listen. Bring the money
here tomorrow, I will take care of the rest.

749
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,828
Do you want it in something specific,
a shoebox, duffel bag?

750
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,398
- Just be here with the fucking money.
- Yeah.

751
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:13,933
- Put it in a briefcase.
- Thanks for your time.

752
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,126
Here we go.

753
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,294
Is the briefcase coming out of your end?

754
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:55,063
Looks like it's all there.

755
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:57,603
Didn't even need a briefcase.
It's a small stack.

756
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,469
- We should have used a manila envelope.
- It's all right.

757
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:04,511
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

758
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:06,853
Ah.

759
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,742
I just got back from doing a dime
for some real nasty shit.

760
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,487
- That's 10 years.
- I know.

761
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:16,750
They're looking at me. I am on probation,
and if I step out of line...

762
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:19,852
...I am going back.

763
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,757
- Right.
- Understood.

764
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:26,124
- Period? End of story?
- What does that mean?

765
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,760
- Wait. You said you'd take care of this.
- Yeah, I will take care of it.

766
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:34,375
I am going to be your murder consultant.

767
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,271
I am sorry, but, uh....

768
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:42,144
- No, man. Right? That's not cool.
- You don't shut this fucking hamster up....

769
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:44,377
- Don't call me a hamster now. Come on.
- Easy, easy.

770
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:46,782
- It's just upsetting.
- No, it's somewhat accurate.

771
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:49,015
Look, that is not what we talked about,
Motherfucker.

772
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:52,160
So how about we just take the money
and we will get out of here?

773
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,318
How about you go fuck yourself?
No refunds.

774
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,193
That's $5000. If you think we're just going
to walk out and let you keep that.....

775
00:40:58,193 --> 00:41:00,995
I think you're forgetting....
Don't go grabbing quickly.

776
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,193
Jesus.

777
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,738
Mr. Motherfucker, please,
don't shoot us. Let's just talk it out.

778
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:08,172
Listen, $5000 is mine.
I don't care what you say.

779
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,710
You can take my advice
or get the fuck out of here.

780
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,040
- That's a terrible deal.
- We should listen.

781
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,149
- Okay, $5000 worth of advice?
- Yeah.

782
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,750
Most killers are first-timers.

783
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,445
You want to pull off a brilliant murder,
you got to act like it's an accident.

784
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,682
Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide.

785
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,919
You do it right, you ain't even
got to be there when it goes down.

786
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:29,655
Oh, boy. That's five grand worth, huh?

787
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,834
- Pretty pedestrian.
- Not really. Obvious information, isn't it?

788
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:36,301
Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we
supposed to fake three accidents?

789
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:37,530
You stalk your prey.

790
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,870
Got to be smart. Find out where they live,
find out their habits. What's their hobbies?

791
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,808
What they like, what food they like,
who they fucking.

792
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:46,675
- Word.
- Find them vulnerable.

793
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:50,284
I have a job, you know?
What's that, surveillance and recon?

794
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:54,081
That's why we were hiring, because
we want to sub that out. We have jobs.

795
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,815
Even if you pull it off perfectly...

796
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,559
...if you crackers got motives...

797
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,751
...the popo...

798
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,954
That's police.
.....will pin it to you.

799
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,726
We all have clear motives
for killing our bosses...

800
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:08,893
...so this is not going to work.
This is garbage.

801
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,563
I got it.

802
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,638
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?

803
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,973
- That's actually a good idea.
- It's not bad.

804
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,641
Yeah, like Hitchcock's
Strangers on a Train, right?

805
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,720
- I didn't see that. They do that?
- Danny DeVito movie. It's funny.

806
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,450
That famous Alfred Hitchcock, Danny
DeVito movie. That's the one he's.....

807
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,890
Come on. You're thinking of
Throw Momma From the Train.

808
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,121
- That's what it is.
- That I saw.

809
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,390
Good movie.
That's what you're thinking about.

810
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,899
Same idea, though. We kill
each other's bosses, there's no link to us.

811
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:43,334
Exactly. Five thousand dollars
well spent, right?

812
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,803
- No. Not at all.
- Waste of money.

813
00:42:45,803 --> 00:42:47,635
Well, too fucking bad.

814
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,072
Get out.

815
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:53,904
Hello.

816
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,018
Hey. I am outside.
You ready to do a little recon?

817
00:42:57,018 --> 00:43:01,520
Yep. Yeah. I have to get Harken
to let me leave a little bit early.

818
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,659
What's the difference? Not like
he will be your boss much longer.

819
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,426
I will be down in three minutes.

820
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:09,359
Three minutes it is. Bye.
He will be down in three minutes.

821
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,093
- Dude, these seats are crazy comfortable.
- Look at this. I know, it's so good. Ah.

822
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:17,631
The worst report I have ever read
in my life, you nimwit.

823
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,535
You're such a fucking dweeb.

824
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,376
Do you have a parking space?
Because I am going to take it away from you.

825
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:27,606
Who is it, like your mother-in-law
that knows my wife?

826
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:30,876
How you got this fucking job,
I don't even understand.

827
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,289
Ugh.

828
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,457
What the hell?

829
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:42,757
Sorry, everybody. I have been fighting
that bug all day. Let me get back to work.

830
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:46,799
No, no, no. You're disgusting. Go home.
I don't want you getting anyone else sick.

831
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:48,698
Probably best.

832
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:52,964
Take all your work with you
and have it on my desk 6 a.m. Monday.

833
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,633
- You got it. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
- Jesus Christ.

834
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,042
Don't forget to take your fucking trash can.
Yeah. No, that's mine.

835
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,614
You goddamn barfing pig.

836
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,545
Evens are over here.

837
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,920
I know, but sometimes on some
streets evens are on the opposite side.

838
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,116
Never.

839
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,558
Never have and they never will.
There it is, 428.

840
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:17,289
- Which one, which one?
- Don't stop right in front of it.

841
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:20,230
Stop right here. Right here, right here.

842
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,836
Okay, boys.

843
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:28,670
We wait till Pellit makes a move,
then we tail him, all right?

844
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,436
- It is on like Donkey Kong.
- Ha, ha.

845
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:33,240
- Hells yeah, man.
- Here we go, huh?

846
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,314
I am fucking pumped.

847
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,148
Oh, my God. This sucks.

848
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,646
This is horrible, man.

849
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,851
Are we even sure this guy's home?

850
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,958
- Let's go check this out.
- Yeah, we should probably look, right?

851
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,894
Shh.

852
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,164
Oh, my God.

853
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,137
What do you want to do?
What's the plan?

854
00:45:00,137 --> 00:45:03,938
- Let's look through this window right here.
- No, no. No, let's ring the bell.

855
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:07,206
You're not going to ring the bell.
Look through the window right here.

856
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:10,647
Chances are, he's not home.
I haven't seen any activity in this house...

857
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:13,788
What are you doing?
You're not going to ring the doorbell.

858
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,795
Whoo-hoo.

859
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,524
- Come on. Come on.
- Dale, Dale, Dale.

860
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,273
I didn't make it in.

861
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:38,702
I am sorry, guys. Didn't make it in.

862
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:39,972
You in?

863
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:43,606
Yeah, I am okay. Jesus Christ,
the guy owns a fucking bear?

864
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,513
- We're breaking and entering here.
- I know. Shh. Oh, look at this.

865
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:51,221
Look at this place. It's awful.
It's like a douchebag museum.

866
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,492
It's like we stepped inside
the mind of an asshole.

867
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:58,127
Shit. He's got a foosball table.

868
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:01,030
Dale. Don't touch anything.
Get your hands off that.

869
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,498
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, fingerprints.

870
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:06,971
- God. We should be wearing gloves.
- We don't have..... Oh, here. I know.

871
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:09,007
Use your sleeves. Use your sleeves.

872
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,872
- For what?
- Use them for gloves.

873
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,981
- Come on.
- I can see my fingerprints from here.

874
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:17,118
- What do we do? What's the plan?
- We're here to get some intel.

875
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,151
- "Intel"?
- It's short for "intelligence."

876
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,846
- I know what it stands for.
- Then why did you ask?

877
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:24,388
Why are we talking
about this? Let's split up.

878
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:28,324
In and out, in and out. We will find something
good, and we're in and out of here.

879
00:46:28,324 --> 00:46:32,126
Stop chatting and start looking.
We're committing a crime. This is a crime.

880
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,125
Whoa.

881
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,007
- Nick.
- Yeah?

882
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:42,700
- Now, this would count as intel, right?
- Holy shit, that's a lot of cocaine.

883
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,743
Have you ever seen this much cocaine?

884
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:47,040
That's got to be worth,
what, 10, 15,000--?

885
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,816
Oh, I blew it. I blew that, didn't I?

886
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,912
Hmm.

887
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,463
- Don't inhale.
- Grab the box. I will scoop it in.

888
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:12,402
I really don't want to touch it.
I don't have sleeve-gloves.

889
00:47:12,402 --> 00:47:14,906
Get something to..... Ugh.
I will scoop it in.

890
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:16,305
So bitter.

891
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:25,714
Hmm.

892
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:36,092
In the butt you go, go, go.

893
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,661
There you go.

894
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:40,891
Big scoop.

895
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,128
All right, let me try this. Look out.

896
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:45,239
- Yeah, that better work.
- Watch out.

897
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:47,599
There you go.

898
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,107
- I don't know.
- Go slow.

899
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:52,803
Get on the couch. Stop helping.

900
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,277
All right.

901
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,855
In you go.

902
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,286
Ooh.

903
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:15,996
You probably should have
emptied the DustBuster first.

904
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,066
Is that what you think?

905
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,676
I was thinking that.
On account of the dust.

906
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,608
Well, I have heard of butt floss,
but this is ridiculous. Ha, ha.

907
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:31,480
- Get a sifter, or a.....
- Colander.

908
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,678
Colander would be good.

909
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,912
And I will start picking.

910
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,254
That will do.

911
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:49,359
I feel like everything will work out.
I am like a machine. Look how fast I am.

912
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,802
I am moving super fast.
I can't even feel my nose.

913
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:54,237
Want to know what's weird?
I should be panicking...

914
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:56,775
...and I am a little,
but it's in a very good way.

915
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:59,709
It's a good kind of panic
because I feel like I want to die...

916
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:02,145
.....but I also feel very, very, very good.
Yeah.

917
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:04,216
Hey. What are you guys doing?

918
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:06,980
Nothing. But before we go,
I want to take one more dump.

919
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,317
Take a dump and I am going to
do push-ups. Because I got to get fit.

920
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,723
What the hell have you guys done?

921
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,926
I am feeling good, dude.
Want to help me clean?

922
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:18,087
We bond over this.
This is friendship stuff.

923
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:21,724
We broke into someone's house.
It's the most amazing experience of my life.

924
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:25,771
We broke into a man's house. Suddenly,
I am like an expert at sifting cocaine.

925
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:28,034
It's amazing.
Come here and help me with this.

926
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,902
Can't believe we weren't prepared.

927
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:32,410
That was completely dangerous,
a total waste of time.

928
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,982
Well, no. Actually, not a total waste
of time. Look what I got.

929
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:37,516
- Not bad, huh?
- What is that?

930
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,585
- Is this his phone?
- That's his phone.

931
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,187
- You steal this?
- I sure did.

932
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,722
- It's got his contacts, schedule.
- Very nice.

933
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:45,188
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

934
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:48,386
That's a crime. Pfft. Nope. Ha.
No one said we'd be stealing.

935
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,225
- This is a good grab.
- We broke in. You guys did cocaine.

936
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:54,334
- Right. Two..... Three crimes.
- He's all jitzed out. Ignore him.

937
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:57,301
We're in the process of
getting ready to kill three people...

938
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:59,872
...and you're giving me shit
about stealing a phone?

939
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,100
Run it by me
if you will be stealing stuff.

940
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,676
- Run it by you?
- Run it by me.

941
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:06,939
- Nick, will you hold this for a second?
- What are you doing?

942
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:09,515
"Run"? I am not going to run
anything by you.

943
00:50:09,515 --> 00:50:12,084
I am not going to run anything by you.
Dickhead.

944
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:14,848
- There's a lot of stuff in here.
- I know.

945
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:19,082
- Want to go check out your boss now?
- Yeah, I guess we should.

946
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,086
- You don't punch the driver.
- You don't punch the fucking driver.

947
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:25,699
I am coked out of my fucking brain.
I will punch whoever the fuck I want to.

948
00:50:41,971 --> 00:50:43,973
Let's do this, guys. Feeling good.

949
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:46,814
- Be very quiet out there.
- Calm down, Dale.

950
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:48,717
You know what? Hang on a second.

951
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:52,792
Dale? Dude, hold it. Last time the three
of us did this, it was very messy.

952
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,225
- It was awesome, exciting.
- It was clunky as hell.

953
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:59,389
Here's what we will do. In the event that
Harken is not here, just me and Kurt go in.

954
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,002
You will stay out here, not go in,
and be our lookout.

955
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:05,162
What? Are you kidding me?
That's awesome. I love that. The lookout.

956
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,467
- I don't know what the guy looks like.
- Doesn't matter.

957
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:10,770
You see anybody, just assume
that it's Harken, send us a signal.

958
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,607
- Okay? Have a seat.
- Okay.

959
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:16,410
Okay. Send a sig.....
I am going to honk the horn six times.

960
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,211
- Goddamn it. No.
- Did he say "six"?

961
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:20,752
- Something much more subtle.
- That's too many.

962
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:23,356
- More subtle? Four honks?
- Can you honk once?

963
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:24,992
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

964
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:27,594
People honk once all the time.
You will be in and out.....

965
00:51:27,594 --> 00:51:30,822
- We will know it's you.
- Come on, man. Dale, two honks.

966
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:34,196
That kind of tone's going to get you nowhere.
All right, two honks.

967
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:37,031
- Just two honks. A little tap, tap.
- Okay.

968
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:41,642
Two very long, very slow honks.

969
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,877
- I am going to check this window over here.
- Okay.

970
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:54,712
There's nothing on that side.
Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there.

971
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,690
I think he's definitely out.

972
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:00,057
Maybe we can find a way in upstairs.

973
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,655
Yeah, or maybe there's a window open.

974
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,537
Or better yet....

975
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,628
That makes things easier, huh?

976
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,899
I like the way you think. Move.

977
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:16,009
- No, don't do that. Hey. God.
- Oh, shit.

978
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:17,567
I broke a rock.

979
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,374
Please tell me you realize
that was a key thingy.

980
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:23,574
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

981
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,981
You weren't going to
throw a rock through the door?

982
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:28,144
No, of course not.
No, I wanted to open it.

983
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,552
Like a real cat burglar.

984
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,849
Wow.

985
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,223
Just recon, now, okay?

986
00:52:37,223 --> 00:52:40,891
Hey, take this. I don't want it.
I want my hands free.

987
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,866
You broke it.

988
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,434
I feel the intel.....

989
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,303
- God.
- Okay, just a cat.

990
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,504
Out of nowhere.

991
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,209
Just a cat. We're all right.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.

992
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,721
They call me hell

993
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:02,151
They call me Stacey

994
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,450
That's not my name
That's not my name

995
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,527
That's not my name
That's not my name

996
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:08,822
They call me hell

997
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:10,157
They call me her

998
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,627
They call me hell

999
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:13,062
They call me Stacey

1000
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:15,896
That's not my name
That's not my name

1001
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,609
Oh. Goddamn it.

1002
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:29,443
Jesus, how many cats do they have?

1003
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,744
- It's the same one, I think. Yeah.
- Really?

1004
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:34,252
Quick little bugger, huh?

1005
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,445
Hey.

1006
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,114
- Shit, is that Harken's wife?
- Yeah, that's her.

1007
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,591
- Oh, man, she is hot.
- She sure is. Here we go.

1008
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:43,856
I'd like to bend her over a barrel
and show her the 50 states.

1009
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:46,895
- I don't know what that means.
- Ah, it's a saying.

1010
00:53:46,895 --> 00:53:50,503
I don't think so.
No, it is, it is. Yeah. No, people say that.

1011
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:53,436
- I haven't heard it.
- I have definitely heard people say that.

1012
00:53:53,436 --> 00:53:55,803
I am not going to argue.
Let's continue the recon.

1013
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:58,878
- Well, it's definitely a phrase.
- It sure isn't.

1014
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:02,244
Yeah, it is. It's from a book.
The Great Gatsby, maybe?

1015
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:06,217
Let's just look for an address book
or a day planner or something. You know?

1016
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:10,323
You know, it's too bad we're not looking
for cats. These people fucking love cats.

1017
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,435
Hey, schmuck-face.

1018
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:41,153
You want to tell me what you're doing
littering on my street?

1019
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:44,779
I think what happened, ahem, was that
the wind blew it out of my hand.

1020
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,290
I don't care if the wind
blew it out of your twat.

1021
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:51,625
Why don't you take this piece-of-shit car
and get off my fucking block.

1022
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:55,632
I don't know why you're mad at the car.
I don't think we should get hostile now.

1023
00:54:55,632 --> 00:54:57,633
"Hostile"? You want to see hostile?

1024
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,499
How about I go in my house
and I get my....?

1025
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,341
What are....?
What's going on with you?

1026
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,044
Peanuts.

1027
00:55:05,044 --> 00:55:06,974
"Penis"?

1028
00:55:07,602 --> 00:55:09,013
Oh, peanuts.

1029
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:12,344
That was a peanut butter sandwich.
Are you not good with peanuts?

1030
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:15,351
What are you pointing at?
What's going on? What's here?

1031
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:17,846
Oh, I got it. What do I do? What do I do?

1032
00:55:18,313 --> 00:55:21,658
"Check the needle, pump back, pump....."
Okay, hold on. I am a slow reader.

1033
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,318
"Hold the pump....." Okay, okay.

1034
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:26,022
Jab it in your chest. Okay.
I got you, dude. Ready?

1035
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:31,731
How you feeling, you good?

1036
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:34,203
You good? Did I get you? Did I get you?

1037
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:40,608
Whoa. Whoa. Dude, come here. Hurry.

1038
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,305
Look at this.

1039
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:47,346
- Is that Harken? Dale's killing Harken?
- That's Harken?

1040
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:49,352
I am going to hit you again, okay?

1041
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:52,289
- What is he doing?
- He's really doing it?

1042
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,757
- This is the recon stage.
- Holy shit.

1043
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:57,556
We got to get out of here.
Come on, we got to go. Oh, God.

1044
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:01,826
I am pushing on it. Okay.

1045
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:05,797
What about little jabs? Little jabs?

1046
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,234
Do I get your neck?

1047
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:10,800
Was that good?

1048
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:15,640
Come on, man.

1049
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,839
Oh, my God.

1050
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:18,278
Hey, hey. Come here.

1051
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:21,819
What's going on? What are you doing?
What's happened?

1052
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:24,547
I think he's okay. I hit him
with this. Do you know him?

1053
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,182
Of course, he's my husband. Sweetie?
Honey? Sweetheart, are you okay?

1054
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:33,493
- There he is. Hey.
- Ah. What did you do to me?

1055
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:36,636
I saved you with your thingy.
It was incredible.

1056
00:56:36,636 --> 00:56:39,169
Oh, my God, sweetie.
He saved your life.

1057
00:56:39,169 --> 00:56:40,397
You saved his life.

1058
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:42,799
Okay. That's cool.

1059
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,001
- What's with the hugging?
- Saved your life.

1060
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:49,672
Oh, sweetie, I am just so grateful
that he was here. You could have died.

1061
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,182
- I am sure you are grateful he's here.
- Yes, I am.

1062
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:54,149
- You know this guy?
- No, I don't.

1063
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:57,654
Are you fucking this guy? What were
you doing, waiting to fuck my wife?

1064
00:56:57,654 --> 00:57:00,554
Dude, I just met your wife.
You want your thing back?

1065
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,594
- You better get out of here.
- No problem.

1066
00:57:04,594 --> 00:57:06,925
Dave. Dave, what are you.....? Honey?

1067
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,865
Honey, you should be thanking this young
man. Why are you being so suspicious?

1068
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:12,868
Why? You know why I am being suspicious.

1069
00:57:12,868 --> 00:57:14,506
Because I know you sleep
around on me.

1070
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:16,899
That's ridiculous.

1071
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:18,703
What about the way
you look at Maurilio?

1072
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:23,848
You realize we're all going to jail
because of that idiot?

1073
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:27,043
Man, I can't go to jail. Look at me.
I will get raped like crazy.

1074
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,448
Fuck, me too.

1075
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:31,452
Yeah, totally.

1076
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,587
I'd get raped just as much
as you would, Kurt.

1077
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:38,386
- Do you think you're more rape-able?
- I am not saying that.

1078
00:57:38,386 --> 00:57:40,559
- You're pretty close to saying.....
- Oh, fuck.

1079
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:49,831
Holy shit.
Did you guys see me out there?

1080
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:51,477
Yeah, we saw you, Dale.

1081
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:53,613
Shh. Yeah, we saw that.

1082
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:55,042
How cool was that?

1083
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:57,979
It wasn't cool at all.
We come out to gather information...

1084
00:57:57,979 --> 00:58:01,416
...and you start stabbing Harken to death
in front of the neighborhood?

1085
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03,817
- Harken?
- Who'd you think you were stabbing?

1086
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,150
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1087
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,022
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts
and I rescued him, know what I mean?

1088
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:11,186
He had a little allergy shot on him
and I.....

1089
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:14,424
I mean, I jabbed him with that,
but I was just saving his life.

1090
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,364
- Saved a man's life.
- Hang on a second.

1091
00:58:16,364 --> 00:58:19,095
So my boss, who we're
thinking about planning to kill...

1092
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,763
...is dying in front of you
and you saved his life?

1093
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:24,376
Well, that sounds bad
when you say it like that.

1094
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,808
- Can you open the door?
- That's not cool.

1095
00:58:26,808 --> 00:58:29,505
- But I didn't know it was Harken.
- Hit the button.

1096
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,947
This is why I need to know
what people look like.

1097
00:58:31,947 --> 00:58:33,779
You're mad at me for killing him....

1098
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:35,922
Can we give him a time-out?
For one second.

1099
00:58:35,922 --> 00:58:38,318
Make up your fucking mind.
It's like....

1100
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:39,514
What is this?

1101
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:42,025
You got to admit
we got some good intel tonight.

1102
00:58:42,025 --> 00:58:45,596
Harken is allergic to peanuts
and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.

1103
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:47,027
Are you playing this game?

1104
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:51,364
So all we got to do is figure a way to get
peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...

1105
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,472
...and put some poison in Pellit's coke.

1106
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:56,768
It's easy for someone to think
Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.

1107
00:58:56,768 --> 00:59:00,037
You seriously locking me
out of the car like we're in 8th grade?

1108
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,943
What about Harken? Probably
always got that injector thing.

1109
00:59:02,943 --> 00:59:04,481
Doesn't shower with it.

1110
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:06,949
So then we will put some peanuts
inside his shampoo.

1111
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:09,815
A couple of fatal accidents
we're not even there for.

1112
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:12,515
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud.
- Yeah, he would.

1113
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:15,354
- Getting old.
- What do you do about dummy's boss?

1114
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,156
I will stake her out tomorrow
and get to the bottom of it.

1115
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:21,198
- A man has his limits.
- That left a fucking dent.

1116
00:59:23,591 --> 00:59:25,332
Get him fucking home.

1117
00:59:25,332 --> 00:59:29,566
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.

1118
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,234
We have one thing to figure out,
if you can help us.

1119
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:35,779
If Nick and I were in prison,
who do you think would get raped more?

1120
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:37,811
Nick.

1121
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,953
Really? Why?

1122
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:44,213
It's about weakness and vulnerability.
It's not a looks thing.

1123
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,585
It probably would be Nick.

1124
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:48,990
Getting locked out of the car
is bullshit, man.

1125
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:35,272
That's an awesome deal.

1126
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:44,141
Jesus, Dale. It's a murder,
not a cocktail party.

1127
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,751
I know. You don't have to
announce that to the world.

1128
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:49,912
There was a great deal on nuts.
I am not going to pass up on savings.

1129
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,284
Okay, so this is it.

1130
01:00:51,284 --> 01:00:55,690
I am doing Pellit, you're going to do Harken,
and you will get some intel from Julia, right?

1131
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,420
- Copy that.
- Okay. See you on the other side.

1132
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:30,261
Okay.

1133
01:01:34,822 --> 01:01:36,699
- Thank you, Kimmy.
- You're welcome.

1134
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:38,460
That was great.

1135
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,936
- See you next time.
- Yeah.

1136
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:44,474
- Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you, Bobby.

1137
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:53,877
What?

1138
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:55,817
Whew.

1139
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:57,746
Oh.

1140
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,429
Shit.

1141
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:10,067
- Hey.
- How's it going over there?

1142
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:13,565
- What do you know about Julia?
- I learned I got to switch dentists...

1143
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:15,730
...because this woman is unbelievably hot.

1144
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,106
- How's it going over there?
- Uh, it's.....

1145
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,906
Just..... I am waiting for, you know,
Pellit to sleep or leave or....

1146
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,551
Just..... Just waiting.

1147
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,449
Wonder what, uh,
Dale's doing with Harken.

1148
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:31,351
It's going to be really hard.

1149
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:35,358
And we will have to work at this every day,
but I want to do that because I want you.

1150
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,861
I want all of you forever, you and me,
every day......

1151
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,947
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1152
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:03,618
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1153
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:07,317
Give me that.

1154
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,223
Give it to me.

1155
01:03:27,702 --> 01:03:31,673
Jesus. Where does this guy
get the energy?

1156
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,513
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:56,900
What the fuck was that?

1158
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:06,181
Okay. Okay.

1159
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:14,556
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:22,567
- Yeah, Dale?
- I don't think I can do this.

1161
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:26,033
Look, I know
you really hate Harken but...

1162
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,771
...I don't think
I can go through with it.

1163
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:29,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1164
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:33,203
I know. I have been thinking
the same thing.

1165
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,938
Yeah, let's just call it off.
What the fuck?

1166
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,242
- What?
- It's Harken. He's here.

1167
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:39,476
He's at Pellit's? Why?

1168
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:42,143
I don't know. He's walking
right up to the front door.

1169
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:45,353
- You think he's onto us?
- How the fuck do I know?

1170
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,726
Knock a little louder?

1171
01:04:47,726 --> 01:04:50,917
- What? 
- What?

1172
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:54,623
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ,
Harken just shot Pellit.

1173
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:56,166
Are you sure?

1174
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:59,703
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door,
Harken shot him in the chest...

1175
01:04:59,703 --> 01:05:02,033
...he fell down, he shot him again
in the head.

1176
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:05,769
He shot him? Wait, what's going on?
I don't understand. He shot him?

1177
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,970
Nick? Say something.
Nick, Nick.

1178
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,344
Nick. Nick, Nick, talk to me.
Nick, what's happening?

1179
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:12,609
What's going on?

1180
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,253
- How's Pellit doing?
- Still pretty fucking dead, Dale.

1181
01:05:22,516 --> 01:05:26,464
I got to get out of here before somebody
sees me. Meet me at the bar. I will call Kurt.

1182
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,032
Yeah. I will meet you there.

1183
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:32,103
I might throw up a couple times in the toilet
here, but then I will meet you there.

1184
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:35,565
Oh.

1185
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,038
Oh, Toyota.

1186
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:49,782
Stay calm. We will figure this out.

1187
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:51,946
"Calm"?
I saw a guy get shot an hour ago.

1188
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:55,617
- I know. A guy you were going to kill anyway.
- Listen, I don't know about that.

1189
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,489
- What?
- Don't know if I had it in me.

1190
01:05:57,489 --> 01:05:59,723
I freaked out and panicked,
got out of there.

1191
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:02,333
Are you kidding?
You can't change a plan like this.....

1192
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,525
I am not a murderer.

1193
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,695
You think when it came down to it,
you'd be able to kill Julia?

1194
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:10,707
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
It is a little hard to imagine killing her now.

1195
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:13,971
"Now"?
Wait, what does that mean?

1196
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,739
- Did you sleep with her?
- No, no.

1197
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,315
- Tell me you didn't sleep with her.
- You're a mess.

1198
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:20,748
But this time it wasn't my fault,
I swear to God.

1199
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,286
You will be a suspect
if you try and kill her now.

1200
01:06:23,286 --> 01:06:26,482
At first I was surveilling her,
like I was asked to do.

1201
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,823
- She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.
- Don't talk about how hot she is, bastard.

1202
01:06:30,823 --> 01:06:33,192
Next thing,
she starts deliberately undressing.

1203
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:34,389
Come on.

1204
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:36,501
In front of her window with the lights on.

1205
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:39,069
Like she knew I was watching.
"Deliberately undressed"?

1206
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:41,399
Slowly, seductively,
lot of shoulder moves...

1207
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:43,439
...is clearly putting on a show.

1208
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:46,510
- Next she makes herself a little snack.
- She have a nice chest?

1209
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,702
A Popsicle.

1210
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:49,438
- Then a banana.
- Come on.

1211
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:53,141
And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on.
Now I don't believe your story.

1212
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:56,186
Three penis-shaped foods,
that can't be a coincidence, right?

1213
01:06:56,186 --> 01:06:58,949
Eating them in that weird order?
Not a proper meal.

1214
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:00,183
It's cold to hot.

1215
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,260
Fine. So you took the penis foods
as an invitation to fuck her.

1216
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,229
No, no. God, no. I took her invitation
to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.

1217
01:07:07,229 --> 01:07:09,697
She lured me in. It was
like one of these things.

1218
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:12,360
- Something clinically wrong with you.
- You're a whore.

1219
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,370
Come on. That's not nice, okay?
Look, your problem's solved.

1220
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,031
She won't mess with you anymore.

1221
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:19,838
Can we move on?
Let's talk about what happened to Pellit.

1222
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:23,675
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay,
here's what I am thinking. Here's my idea.

1223
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:26,250
We call the cops
with an anonymous tip. All right?

1224
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,444
We tell them Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

1225
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:32,056
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her...

1226
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:34,420
...and all three of us
have our problems solved.

1227
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,823
It could work. An anonymous tip,
that's not bad.

1228
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:38,019
Mm-hm.

1229
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:41,132
Got to be from a pay phone, though,
so it's not traced back to us.

1230
01:07:41,132 --> 01:07:44,326
- Exactly.
- Good. Let's take my car. Let's do it.

1231
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,033
All right. Where do you even
find a pay phone these days?

1232
01:07:48,033 --> 01:07:50,175
There's a ton at the bus station for sure.

1233
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:53,141
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point.
Maybe the mall.

1234
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:54,745
What is this?

1235
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:57,912
- What is this?
- Is that for us?

1236
01:07:57,912 --> 01:08:00,211
- What?
- Oh, shit.

1237
01:08:07,982 --> 01:08:09,757
All the way down.

1238
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:12,789
Right there.

1239
01:08:14,488 --> 01:08:18,197
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- I own it. Yup.

1240
01:08:18,197 --> 01:08:23,774
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius,
license 2-Whiskey-Alpha-Quincy-2-3-3.

1241
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:25,171
- How come?
- Hang on, man.

1242
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:27,312
- Did I talk to you?
- No.

1243
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:30,443
That's this car. Tell me how I can help.

1244
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:33,676
A traffic cam caught this car
fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.

1245
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,311
- Would you know anything about that?
- I don't know why it would do that.

1246
01:08:37,745 --> 01:08:40,726
I mean, I don't know. What happened?

1247
01:08:40,726 --> 01:08:42,918
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1248
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,490
I smell alcohol.

1249
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,859
- This guy and the mouth in the back.
- That's me.

1250
01:08:48,122 --> 01:08:50,295
I am going to need you
to follow us to the station.

1251
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:51,663
Officer.

1252
01:08:52,026 --> 01:08:53,164
My man.

1253
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:59,302
I cannot believe I let you talk me into
this whole thing. I cannot believe it.

1254
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,605
Are you kidding me?
We were being hypothetical.

1255
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:05,499
- Being hypothetical?
- You're the one that pushed us into it.

1256
01:09:08,442 --> 01:09:12,481
Do you want to explain
why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1257
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,853
...one block from the victim's house...

1258
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:17,188
...just moments after he got shot dead?

1259
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:20,026
I was drag racing.

1260
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:24,135
- I am a drag racer.
- You were drag racing?

1261
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:25,361
Mm.

1262
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,596
In a Prius?

1263
01:09:30,998 --> 01:09:32,102
I don't win a lot.

1264
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,610
Here's what I don't understand.

1265
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,975
You were at the crime scene.

1266
01:09:36,975 --> 01:09:41,449
Hour later we find the car. You happened to
be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1267
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:44,419
- A registered sex offender.
- It was an empty playground.

1268
01:09:44,419 --> 01:09:49,183
And this guy. Who happens to be working
for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1269
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,594
What?

1270
01:09:51,952 --> 01:09:53,192
My boss was murdered?

1271
01:09:54,054 --> 01:09:59,436
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his
house, Nick? Why were you there?

1272
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:02,964
Where were you during the murder?

1273
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:07,511
I was making love.
I was making love to a woman.

1274
01:10:07,511 --> 01:10:09,807
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1275
01:10:11,138 --> 01:10:13,709
- Detectives....
- No, uh, I have a question.

1276
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,548
If one of us knew, you know,
who the shooter was...

1277
01:10:16,548 --> 01:10:21,056
...and he was willing to
serve you that perp on a platter...

1278
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:25,185
...he would be entitled
to some sort of immunity, right?

1279
01:10:25,185 --> 01:10:28,196
No. He would be entitled
to some jail time.

1280
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:31,192
If he knew who the shooter was
and didn't tell us...

1281
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:33,235
...that would be obstruction of justice.

1282
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,303
Glad none of us
know who the shooter is.

1283
01:10:35,303 --> 01:10:40,571
Listen, if you think we're going to believe
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1284
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:42,907
...we're going to be here for a long time.

1285
01:10:44,738 --> 01:10:49,778
Okay, wait. By saying
"we're going to be here for a long time...."

1286
01:10:50,411 --> 01:10:53,221
...you're implying that
we're not allowed to leave...

1287
01:10:53,221 --> 01:10:56,987
...which would only be the case if we
were under arrest. Are we under arrest?

1288
01:10:57,284 --> 01:11:00,163
No. We just brought you in
for questioning.

1289
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:03,863
Well, then, ipso facto...

1290
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:07,369
...you don't have sufficient evidence...

1291
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:10,338
...constituting probable cause
for an arrest warrant.

1292
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:11,532
Not yet.

1293
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:16,205
Well, uh, then, pursuant to
the Fourth Amendment...

1294
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:20,641
...I believe we are free to go.
Are we not?

1295
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:22,720
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1296
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:25,724
Technically is good enough for me.

1297
01:11:25,724 --> 01:11:28,723
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1298
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:30,685
Let's go.

1299
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:32,956
We got to get back to your car.
Keep moving.

1300
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:35,600
We get a cab? Take the train?
What do you want to do?

1301
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,431
- You ever been on a subway in this town?
- Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1302
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:42,369
Law & Order, okay? You can
learn stuff watching Law & Order.

1303
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,372
- We showed them, huh?
- We did show them.

1304
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:46,067
You were about to turn us in.

1305
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:50,375
There was a few conversations about ratting
each other out, but it was going to be fine.

1306
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,811
Hold on.

1307
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:54,782
That's for you, hotshot.
Speeding and running a red light.

1308
01:11:55,642 --> 01:11:57,781
You boys don't get
too comfortable out there.

1309
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:03,054
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit
house right now for DNA and fingerprints.

1310
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:06,261
And I will tell you something.
They don't miss shit.

1311
01:12:10,924 --> 01:12:12,995
In the butt you go, go, go.

1312
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:17,106
Why would you put his whole bathroom
in your ass?

1313
01:12:17,106 --> 01:12:21,269
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt.
- Lying. You know there's DNA in your butt.

1314
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:23,915
You just like shoving shit in your ass,
you fucking pervert.

1315
01:12:23,915 --> 01:12:25,880
We are lawyering up, man. That's it.

1316
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,011
I don't have money for a lawyer. I bought
a very expensive ring I can't afford...

1317
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:33,124
...then I gave the rest of my motherfucking
money to Motherfucker Jones.

1318
01:12:33,124 --> 01:12:34,884
That's who we should talk to.

1319
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:39,054
- He's covered us this far, right? Five grand?
- Five thousand. Forty, with the briefcase.

1320
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,529
- Shut up about that.
- Shut up about the briefcase.

1321
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,736
Excuse me. Excuse me. Da-da-da.

1322
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:50,398
- Hello, Motherfucker.
- Hey, look who's back. Look who's back.

1323
01:12:50,398 --> 01:12:53,408
Whatever happened to
that, uh, Strangers on a Train shit?

1324
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:55,240
Didn't work out. We need your help.

1325
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,246
One of our intended victims
killed the other intended victim.

1326
01:12:58,246 --> 01:13:00,009
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's gone bad.

1327
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,051
You guys are some fucking evil geniuses.

1328
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:05,679
Thank you, but we had nothing to do
with it. We don't know why it happened.

1329
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,382
The cops bring us in as suspects.

1330
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:11,257
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because
he shoved a toothbrush up his ass.

1331
01:13:11,257 --> 01:13:13,955
- That's not the point.
- I am giving him the whole story.

1332
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:16,260
I got you. First thing first,
we got to handle business.

1333
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,993
Mm-hm.

1334
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:21,234
- I need $5000.
- There's going to be no more money.

1335
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:22,999
- Two thousand?
- Absolutely not.

1336
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:26,269
No way, Motherfucker. No.

1337
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:29,113
All right, look, pay for my drinks.

1338
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,805
- Pay for his drink.
- I will do that.

1339
01:13:30,805 --> 01:13:32,473
Not a very good negotiator.

1340
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:35,745
The guy that killed the other guy,
are the cops after him?

1341
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,752
No, no, they don't suspect him.

1342
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:39,857
Then this is what you need to do:

1343
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:44,529
Get him to confess to the murder
while you're wearing a wire.

1344
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:46,358
A wire? We can do that. That's easy.

1345
01:13:46,358 --> 01:13:49,694
That how they got you
when you murdered somebody?

1346
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:55,965
- I ain't never murder nobody.
- I am sorry?

1347
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,073
I never murdered anybody.

1348
01:13:58,073 --> 01:14:01,213
Wait, no. You said you did a dime
for some pretty nasty shit.

1349
01:14:01,213 --> 01:14:04,611
It was some nasty shit,
but does that mean I murdered somebody?

1350
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:07,513
- You implied it.
- You didn't murder someone, what'd you do?

1351
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:10,947
All right, listen, get in here.

1352
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:16,353
You guys ever see the movie
Snow Falling on Cedars?

1353
01:14:16,353 --> 01:14:17,552
No.

1354
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:19,391
- Never seen that.
- I love that movie.

1355
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:23,330
What happened was is that I took a video
camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

1356
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,970
They was waiting right outside the exit.
They got me.

1357
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:28,163
- You did 10 years for video piracy?
- Yeah.

1358
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:31,036
- They take that shit so serious, man.
- Not that seriously.

1359
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:32,802
We have been taking murder advice...

1360
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,140
...from some guy whose biggest crime
is taping an Ethan Hawke movie.

1361
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,749
- So you do know the movie.
- I know who's in it.

1362
01:14:38,749 --> 01:14:42,820
Everyone knows the movie. That's not
the point. You tricked us, Motherfuck....

1363
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:47,584
Hang on a second, something doesn't
stack up quite right with this, all right?

1364
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:52,026
So you just call yourself a video pirate,
right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1365
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:54,689
Why do you carry a gun on you,
Mr. Video Pirate?

1366
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:56,357
- A gun?
- Yeah.

1367
01:14:56,357 --> 01:14:58,662
- I don't want to see it.
- It's my cell phone.

1368
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:02,832
It's a Sidekick. I am going to be in the car.
Oh, shit.

1369
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:07,103
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse
people. Goddamn it, I feel like a moron.

1370
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:08,940
- Let's go.
- You are a moron.

1371
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:13,944
Look, you don't go into a bar and
hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

1372
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:16,314
- It was never a black-white thing.
- No, come on.

1373
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:18,456
Let's go. Come on. Dale.

1374
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:20,614
You all motherfuckers crazy.

1375
01:15:30,991 --> 01:15:32,732
Okay.

1376
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:34,065
Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1377
01:15:34,065 --> 01:15:38,540
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready
to roll, I got some fresh batteries in here.

1378
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:42,647
It was a pretty big investment so I should
be the one who does the tape-recording.

1379
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:45,010
- No way. No, I will do it.
- You're going to do it?

1380
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,209
You will have to duct-tape that
to your chest.

1381
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,786
I can't tape this to my chest.
I have hair on chest.

1382
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:52,822
Just put it in your pocket.
Not going to tape it to his chest.

1383
01:15:53,447 --> 01:15:57,657
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come
home, we grab a office chair or something?

1384
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:01,322
One of us gets in the chair, spins around
and dramatically confronts him.

1385
01:16:01,322 --> 01:16:03,331
- I am in the chair.
- Nick's in the chair.

1386
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:05,367
- Why are you in the chair?
- He's my boss.

1387
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:08,995
Maybe we should get three chairs
and all spin around at the same time.

1388
01:16:08,995 --> 01:16:10,266
Confront him like that.

1389
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:12,910
That's not intimidating,
that's like a musical number.

1390
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:15,773
Watch out for the cat.

1391
01:16:15,773 --> 01:16:17,142
Surprise.

1392
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:22,079
Okay. It's a false alarm.
Just mingle, mingle, mingle.

1393
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,482
Hi. Who are you?

1394
01:16:23,482 --> 01:16:25,487
Come inside. Close that door. Hurry.

1395
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:27,523
Um, okay. Now, wait a minute.

1396
01:16:27,523 --> 01:16:30,992
You're the young man who helped Dave
out on the street the other night.

1397
01:16:30,992 --> 01:16:33,461
- That's him.
- Yeah, that's who I am.

1398
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:37,591
- How is he?
- He is great, thanks to you. Thank you.

1399
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,365
- Did I invite you?
- You did and you didn't.

1400
01:16:40,365 --> 01:16:42,370
I work with your husband. We're late.

1401
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,634
- These are my plus-twos.
- He's in the garage.

1402
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:47,868
Oh, we should hide.
Everybody, come on in.

1403
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:51,816
- Someone get the lights.
- Get down, get down, get down.

1404
01:16:52,673 --> 01:16:56,485
I am Kurt, by the way. I didn't get a 
chance to introduce myself at the door.

1405
01:16:56,485 --> 01:16:59,783
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Rhonda. Very nice to meet you.

1406
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,517
Nick didn't tell me
his boss was married to a model.

1407
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,822
Ha, ha. Yeah, not a model.

1408
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:07,893
When did you quit?

1409
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,428
Surprise.

1410
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:16,904
Goddamn it. God, I hate that.

1411
01:17:16,904 --> 01:17:18,270
We got you, huh, honey?

1412
01:17:19,132 --> 01:17:21,442
- So you were surprised?
- Yeah.

1413
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:22,875
Look, sweetie, everybody's here.

1414
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:25,817
I am going to put my stuff down.

1415
01:17:25,817 --> 01:17:28,714
She knows I hate surprises.

1416
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:32,615
I think we got him. Ha, ha.
We got him good.

1417
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:35,418
Okay.

1418
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:37,994
He's gone off on his own.
This is our chance.

1419
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:39,892
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, very ready.

1420
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:41,862
- Stay close, okay?
- Mm-hm.

1421
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:44,668
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1422
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,839
Harken.

1423
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:50,804
I cannot believe my wife invited you.

1424
01:17:51,064 --> 01:17:53,874
What are you doing here?
Come to stab me a few more times?

1425
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,571
- We know what you did.
- Well, what does that mean?

1426
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,842
We were there. We saw you kill him.

1427
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,151
Really?

1428
01:18:01,975 --> 01:18:04,455
So, what is this, then?
Your little shakedown?

1429
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:08,355
You think that you can blackmail me...

1430
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:12,226
...because you saw me
kill my wife's lover?

1431
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,592
Say his name.

1432
01:18:16,523 --> 01:18:18,002
What?

1433
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,899
The man you killed, you say his name.

1434
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:24,304
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name
means nothing anymore.

1435
01:18:24,304 --> 01:18:26,910
There it is. Thank you. Let's do it, guys.

1436
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,547
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hang on. Where the fuck is Kurt?

1437
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:31,307
I killed Pellit.

1438
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,314
Hold that thought,
I am missing my friend Kurt.

1439
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:38,047
I walked right up to his door, I put
a gun in his chest and I shot him.

1440
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,454
Then you know what? You know
what I did after that? I shot him again.

1441
01:18:41,454 --> 01:18:43,595
And let me tell you something.

1442
01:18:44,217 --> 01:18:46,094
I liked it.

1443
01:18:46,953 --> 01:18:50,833
So if you think
that I am some sort of pussy...

1444
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:55,565
...who won't do exactly the same thing
to a couple of lame-assed blackmailers...

1445
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:56,867
...think again.

1446
01:18:56,867 --> 01:19:00,136
Know who thinks you're a pussy?
My friend Kurt. Let me grab him.

1447
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,745
You are pathetic, Hendricks.

1448
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:09,112
You walk into my house on
my goddamn birthday and pull this shit.

1449
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:12,314
Well, let me tell you something.

1450
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,590
You're dead.

1451
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:18,719
You and you.

1452
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,228
- And...?
- Kurt.

1453
01:19:20,228 --> 01:19:23,027
Kurt. Dead men.

1454
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:26,363
I didn't know it was your birthday.
What's he doing?

1455
01:19:26,363 --> 01:19:29,166
- What do you got?
- Getting my gun. Only take a second.

1456
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:30,637
- I will get the car.
- I will go.

1457
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:34,836
We had him, we had the whole goddamn
thing. What the fuck happened to Kurt?

1458
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:36,273
- Hey.
- There you are.

1459
01:19:36,273 --> 01:19:37,471
Where were you?

1460
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,049
My, uh, stomach was bothering me.
Had to use the bathroom.

1461
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:42,483
He confessed everything,
now he's getting his gun.

1462
01:19:42,483 --> 01:19:44,121
- Kurt, what happened there?
- Oh, uh...

1463
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:46,279
...she was giving me a tour
of the mouth..... House.

1464
01:19:46,713 --> 01:19:49,557
- Ow. What are you.....?
- Get in the car. Right now.

1465
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:51,821
- Knock it off.
- Come on.

1466
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:58,229
Look, I wasn't thinking, okay? I am sorry.

1467
01:19:58,758 --> 01:20:02,001
She's just very hot. And I am weak.
I am a weak, weak man, okay?

1468
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:03,300
I admit it.

1469
01:20:04,164 --> 01:20:06,644
- Back it up, back it up.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1470
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:08,302
- They found my DNA.
- Back it up.

1471
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:12,883
Go backwards. Go backwards.
See? They found your poop brush.

1472
01:20:12,883 --> 01:20:16,886
- You are obsessed with your asshole.
- No, I am not. It was a prank, Dale.

1473
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:19,956
Shut it down. Let's start talking about
where we're going to live.

1474
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:23,060
- The current situation won't work.
- There will be cops everywhere.

1475
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,524
You talking about fleeing?

1476
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:27,587
Damn right.
I am talking about Canada or Mexico.

1477
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:30,295
I can't live in Mexico.
I mean, I can't handle the food.

1478
01:20:30,295 --> 01:20:32,368
My digestion alone......
I will probably die.

1479
01:20:32,368 --> 01:20:36,463
You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life?
Shut the fuck up.

1480
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:38,636
I am getting a call. I got to get this.
Hello?

1481
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:40,271
Hello, lover.

1482
01:20:40,271 --> 01:20:43,175
Uh, look, Julia,
now's not a good time to talk.

1483
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:45,407
- Hey, I am not here.
- That's okay.

1484
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,813
I actually meant to
call your home phone.

1485
01:20:47,813 --> 01:20:49,783
You know, tell Stacy about us.

1486
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:53,117
- No, don't do that. Wait. Wait.
- We will learn the metric system.

1487
01:20:53,117 --> 01:20:56,420
We got to buy coats and sweaters
and learn hockey and all that shit.

1488
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,859
No, I think I have waited long enough, Dale.

1489
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:01,363
I am sort of tired of you
toying with my emotions.

1490
01:21:01,363 --> 01:21:02,932
I am not playing with you.

1491
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:06,730
I am not toying with you. I am going to
take care of it. I am going to take care of it.

1492
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:09,772
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you going to do to me?

1493
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:11,769
- I am going to have sex with you.
- What?

1494
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:14,071
I want you to give me details, you pussy.

1495
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,907
And please be explicit.

1496
01:21:15,907 --> 01:21:19,346
Details? I am in a car with people.
Now is not a good time for details.

1497
01:21:19,573 --> 01:21:22,918
I don't care if it's not a great time.
Okay, fine.

1498
01:21:22,918 --> 01:21:25,113
I am going to make you feel good.
You know?

1499
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,758
With my fingers and my tongue
and whatnot.

1500
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,825
I know you can do better than that.

1501
01:21:29,825 --> 01:21:32,623
All right, I am going to put my penis
in your pussy, Julia.

1502
01:21:32,623 --> 01:21:35,096
Oh, boy, that's going to get me done.

1503
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,401
What the fuck was that?

1504
01:21:40,894 --> 01:21:43,431
- What the fuck?
- That's Harken. Lose him.

1505
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,666
- Oh, my God.
- Get out of here.

1506
01:21:48,902 --> 01:21:50,609
Look, careful.

1507
01:21:53,106 --> 01:21:56,451
Hey, are you going to slap me in the face
with your cock, Dale?

1508
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:58,920
Yes, I will slap you in the face
with my cock.

1509
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,356
- This guy's fucking crazy.
- Slap you all over your face with my cock.

1510
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:04,853
- Don't get in a wreck.
- It's go time.

1511
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,658
Okay. More, Dale.

1512
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:10,358
I will go up and down on you...

1513
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,436
...and I will rub my naked butt
against your naked butt...

1514
01:22:13,436 --> 01:22:15,197
...until it's raw and red...

1515
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:17,399
...and we're both really chafed up
real bad.

1516
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:26,849
Not good. Get us out of here.
Get us out of here.

1517
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:28,042
I got it, I got it.

1518
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,115
- Come on.
- I will spit on your arms and stuff.

1519
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:34,019
- What else?
- And then I am going to...

1520
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:36,091
...jam my skull
into the crack of your ass.

1521
01:22:38,351 --> 01:22:40,388
Yeah, baby. In the crack of your ass.

1522
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,898
And I will dance on your boobies,
and I will jump up and down on your butt.

1523
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:49,633
Ah. I will see you Friday, dirty bird.

1524
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:51,139
Good. Friday. See you Friday.

1525
01:22:51,139 --> 01:22:53,299
Nice job fucking the crazy
out of her, Kurt.

1526
01:22:53,299 --> 01:22:55,810
Maybe I should have been
dancing on her boobs, huh?

1527
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,039
Maybe you should have.

1528
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,944
That was very good driving, by the way.

1529
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,175
Thank you very much.

1530
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:03,287
- Good evening, Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah, hey, Gregory. How are you?

1531
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:05,889
Our onboard sensors
report you have had a collision.

1532
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:08,185
That's because
we have a crazy man that hit us.

1533
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:11,227
I will alert the authorities
and direct them to your location.

1534
01:23:11,227 --> 01:23:13,489
Don't call the cops.
They're already after us.

1535
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,658
No, Gregory, they think we murdered
someone, all right? Do not call the cops.

1536
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:21,266
What's going on?
Why you slowing down, Kurt?

1537
01:23:21,266 --> 01:23:24,409
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that.
No, the engine died.

1538
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:26,942
- I remotely disabled your engine.
- What?

1539
01:23:26,942 --> 01:23:28,841
It is standard Nav Guide protocol...

1540
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:30,913
...whenever a driver
has committed a crime.

1541
01:23:30,913 --> 01:23:33,677
I pay 19 bucks a month
for this fucking service.

1542
01:23:33,677 --> 01:23:36,786
Remain with your vehicle.
The police will be arriving shortly.

1543
01:23:36,786 --> 01:23:39,719
Gregory, I thought you were
our fucking friend, man.

1544
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:57,641
Get out of the car, all of you.
Come on. Come on.

1545
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:03,605
Remember I saved your life that one time?
Shut up.

1546
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:07,850
Just take it easy with that....
Shut up.

1547
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,680
I got six bullets in this gun.

1548
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:13,313
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1549
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:15,482
...if I really wanted to,
but I am not going to.

1550
01:24:15,482 --> 01:24:18,128
You're not going to shoot us twice
or not going to shoot us?

1551
01:24:18,128 --> 01:24:19,456
Shut up.

1552
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,366
I got a better idea. I am going to tell
the cops that you killed Pellit.

1553
01:24:24,366 --> 01:24:28,165
And when I found out,
you tried to kill me to shut me up.

1554
01:24:28,165 --> 01:24:29,830
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

1555
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:33,842
Because I don't see one shred
of evidence that proves that I shot Pellit.

1556
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:36,503
And besides, I am the guy
with the bullet in his leg.

1557
01:24:36,503 --> 01:24:37,943
What?

1558
01:24:40,106 --> 01:24:41,949
God, that hurts so much.

1559
01:24:41,949 --> 01:24:43,883
Son of a bitch.

1560
01:24:43,883 --> 01:24:45,454
- Catch.
- No, don't ca.....

1561
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:47,523
- Goddamn it, Dale.
- You see?

1562
01:24:47,523 --> 01:24:51,184
You can't win a marathon without
putting some Band-Aids on your nipples.

1563
01:24:51,885 --> 01:24:54,456
- What does that mean?
- Watch this.

1564
01:25:00,293 --> 01:25:01,567
- Everybody freeze.
- Police.

1565
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:03,935
Drop the gun. On your knees.

1566
01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:07,044
Thank God.
Officers, thank God you're here.

1567
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:09,180
These guys, they shot me.

1568
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,042
- That's not true.
- That's bullshit.

1569
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:13,980
I found out they murdered someone.
They tried to shut me up.

1570
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,053
Please protect me from them.
I have a wife and a cat.

1571
01:25:17,053 --> 01:25:19,588
All right, take it easy.
Call for an ambulance.

1572
01:25:19,913 --> 01:25:23,622
Hey, what is this?
It's nothing. It's just a tape recorder.

1573
01:25:23,622 --> 01:25:25,319
Oh, shit. It's a tape recorder.

1574
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:28,557
A tape recorder. Did you turn that off?
No, it's been recording.

1575
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:31,099
- So listen to us, officer.
- Hands up.

1576
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:34,295
Listen to us for one second.
He confessed to killing Pellit.

1577
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,768
He said he shot him twice...

1578
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:39,172
...and he was going to shoot us once
or twice. He was unclear about that.

1579
01:25:39,172 --> 01:25:42,873
- You are insane.
- Just play the tape. Play the tape.

1580
01:25:44,304 --> 01:25:46,841
But all those people are just right outside.

1581
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,747
Your balls are so smooth.

1582
01:25:49,108 --> 01:25:50,644
Wait a minute. Is that my wife?

1583
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:52,721
No, no. Of course not, no.
Let's move past that.

1584
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:55,553
Jam my skull into the crack of your ass.

1585
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:58,161
I will dance on your boobies,
and jump up and down on your butt.

1586
01:25:58,161 --> 01:25:59,353
What the fuck is this?

1587
01:25:59,353 --> 01:26:02,864
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss.
It's none of your business.

1588
01:26:02,864 --> 01:26:04,524
If you could get to the end...?

1589
01:26:08,261 --> 01:26:09,365
There's nothing on here.

1590
01:26:09,365 --> 01:26:10,940
- Shit.
- What happened?

1591
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,906
Thing must have stopped
when we crashed.

1592
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:14,739
Before this guy
supposedly confessed?

1593
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:17,438
I told you, these guys are liars.
They cannot be trusted.

1594
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,413
They shot me in the leg, killed a guy.

1595
01:26:19,413 --> 01:26:22,075
- He shot himself.
- I don't need to hear anything else.

1596
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:26,086
- Cuff them.
- Oh, my God.

1597
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:29,022
- You don't need to cuff us.
- My God, we're going to jail.

1598
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:30,820
We're going to jail. Unbelievable.

1599
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,395
It hurts. It hurts so much.

1600
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:34,361
Excuse me? Officers?

1601
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:36,693
I should mention
that it is Nav Guide policy...

1602
01:26:36,693 --> 01:26:39,700
...to record all conversations
for quality assurance.

1603
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,169
- Who the hell's that?
- That's our Nav Guide rep.

1604
01:26:42,169 --> 01:26:43,898
- His name is Almonan.
- Hands up.

1605
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,633
- Atmanad.
- Almondmond.

1606
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,142
- Atmanad is what it was.
- Atmanand.

1607
01:26:48,142 --> 01:26:51,111
Atmand..... Gregory, uh, play what he said.

1608
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:53,911
- Play it just after the crash.
- Very good, sir.

1609
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:56,781
You're not going to listen to this.
This isn't evidence.

1610
01:26:56,781 --> 01:26:59,014
I got six bullets in this gun.

1611
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:02,159
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1612
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,761
...if I really wanted to,
but I am not going to.

1613
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,397
- That's it.
- So it was you.

1614
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:12,335
That is not proof. That's just a car.
You're not going to listen to a car.

1615
01:27:12,335 --> 01:27:15,063
Looks like I am getting that promotion
after all. Yeah.

1616
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:17,463
To answer your question,
that was your wife.

1617
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:19,769
- You fucked my wife?
- I fucked your wife.

1618
01:27:19,769 --> 01:27:20,968
Nobody fucks my wife.

1619
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,378
Ah.

1620
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:27,984
How you like them nipples?

1621
01:27:27,984 --> 01:27:29,779
Did you just do the catchphrase?

1622
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:32,150
- Good Will Hunting.
- Good Will Hunting.

1623
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,950
- That's so great.
- Caught it, yeah.

1624
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:37,253
Good Will Hunting rip. Instead of
saying "apples" he said "nipples."

1625
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,488
- Felt like a moment.
- And happy birthday.

1626
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:42,064
So in the end,
we didn't wind up going to jail.

1627
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:44,827
Actually, we did later that night
when they booked us.

1628
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:47,028
But since we led the cops to Harken...

1629
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:50,072
...they ultimately agreed
to let our other offenses slide.

1630
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:51,867
Strangely enough, lucky for Kurt...

1631
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:56,041
...there's no laws on the books against
putting people's toiletries up your ass.

1632
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:58,307
Anyway,
with Harken in his new position...

1633
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:03,750
...on all fours in prison for 25 to life,
Comnidyne made me acting president.

1634
01:28:04,444 --> 01:28:08,119
It's a great job, I got a solid raise
and I am actually my own boss.

1635
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:09,589
Well, except for the CEO.

1636
01:28:09,589 --> 01:28:13,458
- Morning.
- Oh, morning. You, uh, must be Nick.

1637
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:16,395
- I am.
- Well, it's great to finally meet you.

1638
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:19,537
- You too, Mr. Sherman.
- Please. Lou.

1639
01:28:20,226 --> 01:28:22,137
Okay. Lou.

1640
01:28:22,137 --> 01:28:25,401
I appreciate the opportunity
you have given me. I won't let you down.

1641
01:28:25,732 --> 01:28:27,234
Yeah, I am sure you won't, son.

1642
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:30,674
From what I hear, people say
he's the nicest guy in the world.

1643
01:28:30,674 --> 01:28:33,348
Mr. Sherman,
I am sorry your coffee was cold.

1644
01:28:33,348 --> 01:28:34,541
Uh, Lou?

1645
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:35,947
Most people.

1646
01:28:35,947 --> 01:28:39,090
Mr. Sherman, I am hungry.

1647
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,191
Can I come out now, please?

1648
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,725
- You hear that?
- No.

1649
01:28:43,725 --> 01:28:45,988
Sounds like there's someone
in your trunk.

1650
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:50,565
Why don't we let this
be, uh, our little secret?

1651
01:28:50,565 --> 01:28:52,134
I need a shower.

1652
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:54,567
Yeah. Turns out my new boss...

1653
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:56,934
...is a twisted old fuck.

1654
01:28:58,231 --> 01:29:02,111
Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most
senior person in charge of the company...

1655
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:05,272
...which wasn't Kurt.
But he was okay with that.

1656
01:29:05,272 --> 01:29:09,352
Because he realized that when you're
the boss, sometimes people want you dead.

1657
01:29:09,352 --> 01:29:12,888
- Hey, Kurt. Come in.
- Margie, I wanted to congratulate you.

1658
01:29:12,888 --> 01:29:14,081
Thank you.

1659
01:29:14,081 --> 01:29:18,024
If there's anything I can do to help out
before the baby gets here, let me know.

1660
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:20,357
- What baby?
- Your baby.

1661
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:25,125
- I am not pregnant.
- So I am just touching you?

1662
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:27,063
Ay.

1663
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:28,997
Julia.

1664
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:33,978
I was thinking perhaps
we could drill the patient first.

1665
01:29:33,978 --> 01:29:35,168
And Dale?

1666
01:29:35,535 --> 01:29:39,108
Ultimately, he decided his only choice
was to screw Julia after all.

1667
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:43,277
You just continue to surprise me...

1668
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:46,045
...you dirty, dirty little man.

1669
01:29:46,045 --> 01:29:47,991
Just you wait.

1670
01:29:49,615 --> 01:29:51,219
You like that, Dale?

1671
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,988
- You like that, Dale?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

1672
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:53,738
Oh.

1673
01:29:56,189 --> 01:30:00,137
Oh, gosh, do I wish
I could have sex with Julia.

1674
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:04,235
What?

1675
01:30:04,235 --> 01:30:07,173
I am so sorry, but I couldn't keep it
together. It's amazing.

1676
01:30:07,173 --> 01:30:09,506
- She was talking to your penis.
- Who are you?

1677
01:30:09,506 --> 01:30:13,412
Julia, this is my good friend,
Kenny Sommerfeld.

1678
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:15,246
Most Likely to Succeed.

1679
01:30:15,246 --> 01:30:17,479
- Give me some of that.
- Don't you touch me.

1680
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:20,351
Now, Kenny here, he will do
just about anything for 50 bucks.

1681
01:30:20,351 --> 01:30:22,584
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, and it's not pretty.

1682
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,490
But that's why I asked him
to help me frame you.

1683
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:29,793
Really? Is this all you have got?
Your word against mine?

1684
01:30:29,793 --> 01:30:31,526
Don't forget about that guy.

1685
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:35,264
Say hi to my cameraman.
He's filmed a lot of Hollywood hits.

1686
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:37,169
You are a sick little bastard.

1687
01:30:37,169 --> 01:30:39,139
You are a sick little bastard.

1688
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:40,743
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1689
01:30:40,743 --> 01:30:43,881
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second,
all right?

1690
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:45,982
Now, here's what's going to happen, okay?

1691
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:51,418
I am going to take a very nice, very expensive
two-week vacation with my fiancee.

1692
01:30:51,418 --> 01:30:54,717
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right?
And you are going to pay for it.

1693
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:59,954
Then I am going to return
to a rape-free workplace, all right?

1694
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:05,068
Because if you so much as look
at my sexy little ass, Julia...

1695
01:31:05,068 --> 01:31:07,966
...I will have yours locked the fuck up...

1696
01:31:07,966 --> 01:31:14,043
...you crazy bitch whore.

1697
01:31:14,901 --> 01:31:17,507
Ah, that felt good.

1698
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:29,257
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great?
It's not as bad as his, is it?

1699
01:31:30,883 --> 01:31:36,299
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

1700
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,962
Calm down.

1701
01:31:42,395 --> 01:31:43,533
Oh.

1702
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:49,908
Holy shit. He went out the door.

1703
01:31:50,236 --> 01:31:53,445
This place is awful. It's like
The Sharper Image took a shit in here.

1704
01:31:53,445 --> 01:31:54,812
Five. Forty, with the briefcase.

1705
01:31:54,812 --> 01:31:57,580
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

1706
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:01,555
Going to put that "briefcabe" up my ass.

1707
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:04,792
I am going to put that briefcase up my ass.

1708
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:13,293
A dancing girl

1709
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:15,761
- You're good? He's good.
- Yeah, I am okay.

1710
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:18,298
Or else little Stacy here's
going to get a little peek...

1711
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:21,877
...at my photo album.

1712
01:32:24,637 --> 01:32:27,243
One more. Let's fix this.

1713
01:32:29,108 --> 01:32:31,816
Have you ever in your life
seen this much co.....?

1714
01:32:34,547 --> 01:32:37,323
Pee, pee, pee, pee on the.....

1715
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,990
Let's....

1716
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:47,094
Now I am sneezing dust bunnies.
Is that diabetes?

1717
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:49,262
I am a pharmacist, not a doctor.

1718
01:32:49,262 --> 01:32:51,169
Is that my brain?
Take my temperature.

1719
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:52,775
Have you any, uh, roofies?

1720
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,775
I want a lollipop.
Do you like karaoke?

1721
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:57,710
Do you have MDMA?
I will suck your d.....

1722
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,852
Shit happens.

1723
01:33:06,512 --> 01:33:11,393
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

1724
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,933
Give me....
Give me that again.

1725
01:33:24,497 --> 01:33:26,807
- Oh, hi. Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

1726
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:29,006
Come on, what are you.....?

1727
01:33:30,002 --> 01:33:33,245
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel
and showing her the 50 states.

1728
01:33:33,245 --> 01:33:34,817
I don't know what that means.

1729
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:36,954
- It's a phrase.
- I don't think so.

1730
01:33:36,954 --> 01:33:40,955
Yeah, it is. It certainly is.
Yeah, it definitely is.

1731
01:33:40,955 --> 01:33:43,389
- Really?
- Yeah, it's from a movie.

1732
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:44,584
Uh-uh.

1733
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:46,423
It is now.

1734
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,426
Beautiful.
