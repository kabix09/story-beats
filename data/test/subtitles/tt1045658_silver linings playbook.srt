1
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,717
"What, are you
kidding me? Sundays?

2
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,928
I love Sundays.
I live for Sundays.

3
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:23,472
The whole family's together.
Mom makes braciole.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,475
Dad puts the jersey on.
We're all watching the game.

5
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,395
Yeah, it drives me crazy,
and yes, I was negative.

6
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,772
You didn't even know that I
loved it, nikki, but I did.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,065
I just didn't appreciate it,

8
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,900
or you, before."

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,653
Come on. Time to go.

10
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:42,116
"I lost all that. I blew it.
But you also blew it.

11
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,409
But we can get it back.

12
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,869
We're gonna get it back.
It's all gonna be better now.

13
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:49,289
I'm better now and I hope you are too.
And I'm gonna appreciate..."

14
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,250
I'll be there in a minute, OK?

15
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,210
Doctor's waiting. Let's go!

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,796
I'll be there in a minute.

17
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,926
"That's true love."

18
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,958
Yeah, that's
when I had long hair.

19
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,793
People say I talk
about my hair too much.

20
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,379
And it was just the way I want it,
but he cut it back too far.

21
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,214
He cut this side back too far
trying to even it up.

22
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,383
I didn't tell him to do that.
I said, "Just cut it the way..."

23
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:43,552
Once you get in the right frame
of mind, I think anything's possible.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,514
I think we so often get caught
in this state of negativity

25
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:49,725
and it's a poison like nothing else.

26
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,283
Technically, you can take him
out against our recommendation,

27
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:09,244
but you assume a lot of liability
in the eyes of the court.

28
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,747
And he's just getting
used to the routine here.

29
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:15,542
I don't want him to get
used to the routine here.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,961
Eight months is already long enough.

31
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,057
Hey, Mom.

32
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,686
Can we give Danny
a ride to North Philly?

33
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,189
What? I don't understand.

34
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,233
Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,444
I guess everybody's
leaving today!

36
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,864
Hello Mrs. S.
An honor to finally meet you.

37
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,825
Pat told me all about you,
how God made you rich in character,

38
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,828
and you're the mighty oak
that hold the household together,

39
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:55,165
and not to mention the lasagna you make
on game day when the Birds play.

40
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:05,509
Danny was in for assault
because of crystal meth and alcohol.

41
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:08,470
- Bad combination.
- Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.

42
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:11,598
That's when I was
an X-ray technician and... and I...

43
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,643
...my ADD and my anxiety,
I had a lot of access

44
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,187
to medication and I took
advantage of it.

45
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,147
That's when my hair was long, too.

46
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:22,276
But my hair only grew when I was older
'cause when I was younger,

47
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:23,860
my hair didn't grow
because my brother...

48
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:25,696
Remember I told you
about my brother, he had a Jheri curl

49
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:27,990
and I couldn't get a Jheri curl
because my hair didn't grow long...

50
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,241
He's obsessed with his hair.

51
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,576
I was so jealous of my brother...
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,828
- Hello?
- Yeah, it looks great now.

53
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,580
- You like it?
- No, it's good now.

54
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,164
Wait, man, you're going the wrong way.

55
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,041
- It's this way.
- What?

56
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,543
Are you sure about that?

57
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,838
I'll bring him back right away.

58
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:46,091
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.

59
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,595
All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.
Let's just talk about this.

60
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,305
Mom, just listen...

61
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,765
Don't touch the steering wheel!

62
00:03:56,644 --> 00:04:00,230
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

63
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:03,358
I'm sorry, Mom. You OK?

64
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:06,820
I am out on a limb for you
with the courts right now.

65
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:09,031
It's my fault. Pat didn't know.
Pat didn't know.

66
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:12,117
He's my friend, so he's rooting for me.

67
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,370
I'm having a disagreement with
the hospital, but we're working it out.

68
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:18,290
Take me back to the hospital,
but take Pat home, he's fine.

69
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,168
Trust me. You'll see,
he's fine. It's my fault.

70
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,630
Mom, could we stop at the library?

71
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,799
I wanna read nikki's
entire English high school syllabus.

72
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,970
Mom, it's a good thing.
I'm remaking myself.

73
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,108
DeSean Jackson.

74
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,945
What happened to DeSean Jackson?

75
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,531
- Come on, tell me that one.
- It's insanity.

76
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,327
He spikes the ball at the one-yard line.
The one-fucking-yard line.

77
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,704
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.

78
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,248
I mean, he celebrates
before he's even in.

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,000
You know something?
It's nothing new.

80
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,044
Your team does that all the time.

81
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:05,754
They get close and then they blow it.

82
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,506
They've got an inferiority complex.

83
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,424
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,218
What makes the Cowboys
America's Team?

85
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:12,969
Because we are,
we're America's Team.

86
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,930
You should be with us,
with Philadelphia,

87
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:16,807
what's the matter with you?
You're a fucking traitor.

88
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,809
What's more American than a Cowboy?

89
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:20,268
- You know what's more American?
- What?

90
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:21,937
Benjamin Franklin,
that's what's more American.

91
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,855
- Benjamin Franklin?
- Benjamin Franklin.

92
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,691
The founder of our country, Philadelphia.

93
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,235
With the little
glasses and long scraggly hair?

94
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:29,569
What about
the lightning with the kite?

95
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:31,196
He stood in a storm with a kite.

96
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,866
If he wasn't on the $100 bill,
nobody would even know who he is.

97
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,369
- Why you got so many of these things?
- Don't touch them.

98
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,871
I didn't even touch them.
Don't blame me.

99
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,708
Who did this?
Who took the remotes like this?

100
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,502
- Did you do this, Randy?
- No, I don't touch them.

101
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,504
As a matter of fact,
I don't know why you need so many.

102
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:50,132
Hey! Ah! There she is!

103
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,717
Look how beautiful!

104
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,720
What? What's this?

105
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,062
- Everything good?
- Mm-hm.

106
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,107
Ah.

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,279
- Where is it?
- It's right here.

108
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,531
You got it. Well, we got that.

109
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,074
We don't want them to steal that.

110
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,702
- You still got yours?
- Yeah, I got mine.

111
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:23,707
So, you don't talk to me?
You didn't tell me you took him out?

112
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,292
Well, he's ready. Look at him.

113
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,085
You didn't tell Dad
you were picking me up?

114
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,628
Don't worry about that.

115
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,547
I wanna make sure when
you come out that you're OK,

116
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,924
and she didn't say anything.
You didn't tell me.

117
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,469
The court said yes. Don't worry.

118
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,053
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?

119
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,931
Because the court listens to the doctor.

120
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,725
- Yeah, and the court said...
- The court listens to the doctor.

121
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,560
Dad, Dad... Relax.

122
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,520
The court said it's fine, OK?
Let it go.

123
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,314
Yeah. Don't worry.

124
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:48,732
Dad, I'm in there because of the court.

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,901
That's the agreement
that we made months ago.

126
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:52,569
It was a plea bargain with the courts.

127
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:55,697
The lawyer he instructed,
he said we should plead that,

128
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,741
and then I would serve eight
months and then I'd get out.

129
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,118
It's all under control.

130
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,623
Well...
OK, OK. Congratulations.

131
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,875
Thank you. So what are
you doing with yourself?

132
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:10,253
You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.
It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.

133
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,755
How you gonna pay for it?

134
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,006
I'm gonna pay for it,
don't worry about it.

135
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,175
From your bookmaking?

136
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,302
- Who told you that?
- Mom told me. Outside.

137
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,304
- I did not. No, I didn't.
- You just told me outside, Mom.

138
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,472
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,890
Five minutes ago, we were
walking up the stairs, you said,

140
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,684
"Don't say anything, but Dad
lost his job and he's bookmaking."

141
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,732
Why? Why, dolores?
Why did you say that to him?

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,818
He has the wrong idea.
Everything is fine, Patrick.

143
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,237
I'm more concerned
about you than anything else.

144
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:38,031
- Good, Dad. Good.
- OK, the question, the big question is

145
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,866
what are you
gonna do with yourself?

146
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,744
What am I doing?
I'm getting in shape.

147
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,413
I'm getting trim,
I'm getting really fit for nikki.

148
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:49,918
I'm gonna read nikki's teaching syllabus
and get my old job back.

149
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,049
nikki sold the house. She left.

150
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:58,593
- Didn't your mother tell you?
- Let me tell you something.

151
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,137
You don't know anything about
my marriage, OK, Dad? All right?

152
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:05,225
Our marriage, we're
very, very much in love, OK?

153
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,894
Just like you two.

154
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:12,899
Listen, Patrick... she's gone.
She's not around anymore. nikki left.

155
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,027
What are you doing, Dad?
Excelsior.

156
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,321
- Excelsior. Excelsior.
- What does that mean?

157
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,532
It means you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take all this negativity

158
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,826
and I'm gonna use it as fuel,
and I'm gonna find a silver lining,

159
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:24,828
that's what I'm gonna do.
And that's no bullshit.

160
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,956
That's no bullshit.
That takes work and that's the truth.

161
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:05,285
What the fuck?!

162
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,832
Stupid fucking book!

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,043
I just can't believe nikki's
teaching that book to the kids.

164
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,420
I mean, the whole time,
let me just break it down for you.

165
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,548
The whole time, you're rooting for
this Hemingway guy to survive the war

166
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:21,009
and to be with the woman that
he loves, Catherine Barkley.

167
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:24,012
It's 4:00 in the morning, Pat.

168
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,264
And he does. He does.
He survives the war.

169
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,600
After getting blown up, he survives it,

170
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,852
and he escapes to Switzerland
with Catherine.

171
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,105
But now Catherine's pregnant.
Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant.

172
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,399
And they escape up into the mountains
and they're gonna be happy,

173
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,735
and they're gonna
be drinking wine and they dance.

174
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:40,987
They both like to dance with each other.
There's scenes of them dancing,

175
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,907
which was boring, but I liked it,
because they were happy.

176
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:46,368
You think he ends it there? No!

177
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:50,330
He writes another ending.
She dies, Dad.

178
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:53,458
I mean, the world's hard enough
as it is, guys.

179
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,168
It's fucking hard enough as it is.

180
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,295
Can't somebody say,
"Hey, let's be positive?

181
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,673
Let's have a good ending to the story?"

182
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,469
Pat, you owe us an apology.

183
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,722
Mom, I can't apologize.
I'm not gonna apologize for this.

184
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,226
You know what I will do? I will
apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway,

185
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,770
because that's who's to blame here.

186
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:17,399
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call
us and apologize to us, too.

187
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,036
- Why didn't you run with me, huh?
- I was reading.

188
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:33,206
Oh, please. Do us a favor,
don't read for a while.

189
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:35,542
- What're you wearing a garbage bag for?
- Gonna go run now.

190
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,796
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You have to fix this window.

191
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:41,756
- I'll fix it when I get back.
- Fix it now.

192
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:44,217
Get in the car, Pat.
You have to go to therapy.

193
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:47,262
- I don't wanna go to therapy.
- You have to go. It's part of the deal.

194
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,639
You can't live with us and not go.

195
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,587
Is that song really playing?

196
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,381
We have music sometimes.

197
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,760
That song is killing me.
Could you please turn it off?

198
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,637
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

199
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,806
I don't have the controls.
I'm sorry, I...

200
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,308
Did Dr. Timbers
put you up to this?

201
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,768
Is there a speaker here?

202
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,437
Is the speaker here?

203
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:45,028
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
OK? I'm sorry.

204
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,489
I'll fix all this, OK?

205
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,081
That was a messed up thing
you did, Dr. Patel, all right?

206
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,999
That's a messed up thing.
I'm sorry, but that's...

207
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,375
You can call me Cliff, please.

208
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,002
Yeah, well, Cliff,
that's not the way

209
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,754
you're supposed
to meet people, OK?

210
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,380
You should write that down
in your, I don't know,

211
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,174
you have a little book
you write stuff down in?

212
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,801
I'm sorry about that song.

213
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,552
I just wanted to see if it
was still a trigger for you.

214
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,557
Bravo. It's a trigger.

215
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,559
I'm not gonna take any meds,
I should just tell you that right now.

216
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,686
- No, you have to take medicine.
- No, I'm not gonna take any meds.

217
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:20,647
- It makes me foggy...
- No, you will have to take medication.

218
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:22,315
I don't want any meds, Doctor.

219
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,151
I'm sorry, look,
I am not the explosion guy, OK?

220
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,155
My father is the explosion guy.

221
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:32,367
I'm not that guy.
He got kicked out of that stadium.

222
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,829
He beat up so many people at Eagles
games, he's on the exclusion list.

223
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:40,542
- I had one incident.
- One incident can change a lifetime.

224
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,587
But I'm ready.

225
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,340
I'm ready to take responsibility
for my side of the street.

226
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,342
She just needs to take
responsibility for hers.

227
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,552
What's hers?

228
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,762
- "What's hers?"
- Mm-hm.

229
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,180
Are you joking?

230
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,684
Let's go back to the incident.

231
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,980
I come home from work after I left
early, which I never do, by the way,

232
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,566
but I got in a fight with nancy,
the high school principal.

233
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,068
I come home and what's playing
but the song from my wedding.

234
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:10,280
The song that you so charmingly
played out here today for us.

235
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,615
That's playing and I don't think
anything of it.

236
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:15,994
Which is odd, 'cause I should've.
I come home, what do I see? I see...

237
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,913
...I walk in the door and I see
underwear and pieces of clothing,

238
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,666
and a guy's pants with his belt in it,
and I walk up the stairs,

239
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,918
and all of a sudden I see the DVD
player, and on the DVD player

240
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,712
is the CD and it's playing
the wedding song.

241
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,631
And then I look down and I see
my wife's panties on the ground.

242
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,217
And then I look up and I see
her naked in the shower,

243
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,219
and I think, "Oh, that's kinda
sweet, she's in the shower.

244
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,513
What a perfect thing. I'm gonna
find her and maybe I'll go in there.

245
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,266
We never fuck in the shower
anymore. Maybe today we will."

246
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,561
I pull the curtain back and there's
the fucking history teacher with tenure.

247
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,567
And you know what he says to me?

248
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,404
"You should probably go."
That's what he says to me.

249
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:55,158
So yeah, I snapped.
I almost beat him to death.

250
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,328
But then I get fucking chastised for it?
That I'm parallel to my father?

251
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:01,414
- I don't think so.
- All right.

252
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,959
Can you talk about something
that you did, before or after?

253
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,463
Yeah, about a week before the incident,
I called the cops and I told them

254
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,715
that my wife and the history guy
were plotting against me

255
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,385
by embezzling money from
the local high school, which...

256
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,808
...wasn't true.
It was a delusion.

257
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,770
And we later found out from
the hospital that it's because I'm...

258
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,815
Undiagnosed bipolar.

259
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,278
Yeah. With mood swings and...

260
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,197
...weird thinking brought on
by severe stress,

261
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,033
which rarely happens, thank God.

262
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,830
And then the shower incident happened
and that's when everything snapped,

263
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:46,668
so... I then realized that,
oh, wow, you know,

264
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,170
I've been dealing with this
my whole life.

265
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,506
And without any supervision.

266
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,385
I've been doing it all on my own,
with no help and, you know,

267
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,263
basically I've been living, like,
white-knuckling it this whole time.

268
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,557
- That had to be hard.
- Yeah, it's a lot to deal with,

269
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,851
especially when you don't know
what the hell is happening.

270
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,562
Which I do now. Sort of.

271
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,982
Pat, you have to take
your medication.

272
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,316
I can't, Mom. I can't.

273
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,026
I will call them.
They'll come for you.

274
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,987
Why would you do that?
You wouldn't do that.

275
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,781
- What's up?
- I don't feel good when I'm on it, Mom.

276
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,368
I'm so much clearer without it.
Mom, it makes me bloated.

277
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,036
I don't like the way it
makes me look.

278
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,621
Why don't you just
take your medication?

279
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,124
Come on, I'm doing it
with my physicality.

280
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,792
I've been working out,
that's what I'm doing.

281
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,043
Why is he wearing
a garbage bag?

282
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,753
Why are you wearing
a garbage bag?

283
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,047
- To sweat.
- Sit down. Come on, sit down.

284
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,758
We're seven minutes in, no score.
Come on, help turn the juju around.

285
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,761
- I don't believe in juju, Dad.
- Come on, Mr. Excelsior.

286
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,638
You wanna be positive?
Be positive. Sit down.

287
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,265
- All right, all right.
- Come on.

288
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,017
For a second. I'll
watch the beginning of the game.

289
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,310
He said
you're good luck, honey.

290
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,313
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a...

291
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,110
- See? Yeah.
- Handkerchief?

292
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,033
That's OCD. That's crazy.

293
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,827
What OCD? So I want my son
to watch the game with me, so sue me.

294
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,787
No, sit down, just sit down. Come on.

295
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:08,207
I want you to watch the game
with me. I'm not superstitious.

296
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,085
That's a small thing that I do.
If I make a lot of money,

297
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,962
what's the difference
if I do this or that?

298
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,589
It's a small thing.
Sit down. Come on.

299
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,842
Come on. I'm making
crabby snacks and homemades.

300
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,303
Touchdown!

301
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:23,598
You see? You see that?
You're meant to be here!

302
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,558
This is special.
Everything happens for a reason.

303
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,310
That's why you came home.

304
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:28,978
Embrace it! Embrace it!

305
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,313
I'm the reason?
I don't think so.

306
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:32,982
Yeah? Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes.

307
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
- I got your whole sheet. Yeah.
- Mom.

308
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:35,526
No, no, I'm just confirming.

309
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,111
I'm just confirming. OK.

310
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,946
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Can I do an interview for

311
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,157
- a school project on mental illness?
- No.

312
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,992
- Come on! A school project!
- Don't pay any attention.

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,243
Who's that?

314
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:45,912
- That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
- That's him.

315
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,413
Is he the guy who's
having the problem?

316
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,123
- That's the one.
- They don't know what they're saying.

317
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
Don't let them hurt your feelings.

318
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,960
Patrick.
Get outta here with that!

319
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,671
Pat, don't look for nikki!

320
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,423
- Patrick, please.
- Pat!

321
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:00,218
- Patty! Patty!
- Don't look for nikki!

322
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:24,784
Miss metgers!

323
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,994
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- nance!

324
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:30,081
It's my lucky day!
Look at you working on a Sunday!

325
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,668
- How are you? Hey.
- What are you doing here?

326
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,295
I just came by to say hi, let you know
I'm ready to come back to work.

327
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:39,006
- You shouldn't be here.
- I'll work full-time, half-time.

328
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,342
I'll work, I'll sub, I'll work history,
whatever you want.

329
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,845
Here, let me give you a hand.
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

330
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,556
- I got it. I got it.
- Let me just ask you something.

331
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,434
- Does nikki still work here?
- You know I can't tell you that.

332
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,270
- But Doug Culpepper is still here.
- Why would you tell me that?

333
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,938
You know he broke up my marriage.

334
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,731
What're you doing,
being a troublemaker?

335
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:58,609
You know, you look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?

336
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,361
I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.

337
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,114
Get away from me!
Get away! Get away!

338
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,866
I'm better. I just want to let
you know, I'm better now.

339
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,577
OK? I'm better.
I feel good. I feel so good.

340
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,537
Look at my eyes.
Look at how clear they are.

341
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,080
- Don't hug me.
- I'm not a complainer anymore.

342
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:12,582
I'm a positive guy, OK?

343
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,125
- You just have to give it some time.
- Yes.

344
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,960
You know, a lot went down.
People will get over it.

345
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,879
- It'll be all good.
- Yes! It will be!

346
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,839
I'm gonna take that as a silver
development, nancy!

347
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,090
A silver development!

348
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:22,383
- That's a silver lining!
- Good luck.

349
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,389
Ronnie!

350
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,224
Hey!

351
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:36,981
- There he is! He's back!
- Hey.

352
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,566
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

353
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,276
- Welcome back, man.
- Yeah, I'm out.

354
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:41,611
- Yeah? You're out out?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,529
Cool, man.
Wow, you lost a lot of weight.

356
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,072
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Thank you.

357
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,824
I'm sorry I didn't visit
you in the hospital.

358
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,660
You know, work's out of control,
you know, she had the baby.

359
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,955
I'm really glad you're back.
I miss you.

360
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,124
I really need someone to talk to.

361
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,502
You gotta come see the baby.
She's beautiful.

362
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,504
And veronica wants
to make dinner for you.

363
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:03,341
Congratulations on the baby,
but I'm not buying the invitation.

364
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,676
'Cause you think
veronica still hates you?

365
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,556
- I know veronica still hates me.
- That's not true.

366
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:14,352
Yes, it is. nikki always said that
"Ronnie's wife keeps

367
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,854
his social calendar where she
keeps his balls: in her purse."

368
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,440
- That's not true.
- Ronnie? What are you doing?

369
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,150
OK, it's a little true.

370
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,861
But if you think she still
hates you, you're wrong.

371
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,280
Because why would she tell me
to invite you to dinner? Hm?

372
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,658
- Did you invite him?
- Yes!

373
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:32,828
- Well, can he make it?
- I don't know yet!

374
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,164
Can you make it next Sunday?

375
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,000
- Sure.
- I'll see you next Sunday.

376
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,002
Now, you guys are still in touch
with nikki, right?

377
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,088
- Does veronica still talk to nikki?
- Yeah.

378
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,761
- Get in here, please! I need you!
- OK.

379
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,349
As soon as you left, the Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitch out to Randall El.

380
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:57,311
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging
it, loses the challenge, loses the game.

381
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,231
You're in this house,
please show some respect for what I do.

382
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,233
And we should spend
time together anyway.

383
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,235
I'm trying to keep you
out of trouble, please.

384
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,237
I have very,
very good news, everybody.

385
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,073
- Very good news.
- What's that? What's the good news?

386
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,743
- Things are looking up.
- Oh, are they?

387
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,788
You know what, I knew why
they invited me over. I kneow.

388
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:17,957
Listen, she might be with that guy.

389
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,210
- Oh, no way!
- No, she might be with him.

390
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,045
She's afraid of you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

391
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,089
- Doug Culpepper?
- Put the phone down.

392
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,592
You gotta put the phone down, please.

393
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,428
- Stop.
- Look, Dad, Dad.

394
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,514
- Dad, this is my life.
- Give me the phone. Gimme the phone.

395
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,016
- Pat!
- You gotta understand me.

396
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:36,809
- Don't talk about me...
- Well then, stop this!

397
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:38,519
- Then don't fucking do this.
- Don't talk about me like that.

398
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,479
Well then, don't behave this way.

399
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,400
I got a call asking to
check on this house.

400
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:45,943
- Pat Solatano? Yeah?
- Yeah.

401
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,820
Mrs. Solatano, Mr. Solatano,
I'm Officer Keogh.

402
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:50,615
I work this beat. Look, I heard
about the restraining order.

403
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,326
And I heard you went to your
old house and the school. It's not OK.

404
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,829
I've been assigned to your case,
so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me.

405
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:00,750
Do yourself a favor. Respect
the restraining order, OK? 500 feet.

406
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,793
You hear what he just said?

407
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,879
- You have a restraining order.
- Yeah, Dad, I know.

408
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,923
- Thank you, Officer.
- If you need anything, my card.

409
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:10,092
- Thank you. Sorry. We understand.
- Since when do cops have cards?

410
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,302
Shh! Shh!

411
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:18,225
Tell me one thing.
Would you like to be a guy

412
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:21,312
who goes back to jail
or to the hospital? Hm?

413
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,650
So take your medication,
and if you do fine, we'll reduce them.

414
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,736
nikki's waiting for me to get in
shape and get my life in order,

415
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,613
and then she's gonna be with me.

416
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:32,573
And that's better
than any medication.

417
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:36,494
Pat, there is a possibility,
and I want you to be prepared for it,

418
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,245
that she may not return.

419
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:41,666
True love is about letting her
go and see if she returns.

420
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,793
In the meantime,
if you listen to that song,

421
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,503
I don't want you to fall apart.

422
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,214
So get a strategy, OK?
You need one.

423
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,882
Let me just say something,
I'm gonna say something.

424
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,425
OK.

425
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,721
This is what I believe to be true.
This is what I learned in the hospital.

426
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,183
You have to do everything you can,
you have to work your hardest,

427
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,646
and if you do, if you stay positive,
you have a shot at a silver lining.

428
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,858
- Work on a strategy, OK?
- All right.

429
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,363
My friend Ronnie's having
this party on Sunday night,

430
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,782
and it's like a real hoity-toity thing,

431
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,827
and his wife veronica's
a real stickler for...

432
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:19,870
My mom got this Gap outfit
she wants me to wear,

433
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,832
but I wanna wear a jersey that my
brother Jake got me from the Eagles.

434
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,711
- Which jersey?
- DeSean Jackson.

435
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,964
DeSean Jackson is the man.

436
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,341
Well, that settles that.

437
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:43,811
Pat! What are you doing?

438
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,063
- I gotta go, man.
- Why?

439
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,607
I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake,
I shouldn't have worn this.

440
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,401
Dude, you're fine.
I like that jersey.

441
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,027
- I wish I was wearing that jersey.
- I feel like an idiot.

442
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,654
- Are you comfortable?
- veronica's not gonna like it.

443
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,156
- Get over here.
- Plus you got a tie on.

444
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,449
Don't worry about it,
you're the guest of honor.

445
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:57,908
You come however you wanna come.

446
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,952
- Really?
- Get over here.

447
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,496
DeSean Jackson's in the house!

448
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,207
- You mean rookie of the year?
- Yeah.

449
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,085
DeSean Jackson?
DeSean Jackson?

450
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,171
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

451
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:13,591
- Isn't it awesome?
- Not for dinner.

452
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,511
- Look, he got us flowers.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat.

453
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,971
- That's lovely.
- And wine.

454
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:21,974
Check this out.
We just redid the whole thing.

455
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:23,893
Ow!

456
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,728
- Tremendous. Tremendous.
- Isn't it great?

457
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,980
Yeah, man. I'm thinking
of redoing it again.

458
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,398
- Why?
- Because...

459
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:30,941
You're making
a lot of paper to do that.

460
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,693
Yeah, we're doing all right, man.
I can't complain.

461
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,987
- Isn't the market down, though?
- It is down, but you know,

462
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,448
she wants more,
so I'm giving her more, man.

463
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,533
- You know, my dad lost his pension.
- I'm sorry, man.

464
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,452
A lot of people, man.
My uncle, too.

465
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,078
- Really?
- Yeah, but you know what?

466
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:45,623
No disrespect, it's not personal,
but this is the time to strike.

467
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,834
You start snapping up
commercial real estate cheap,

468
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,837
you flip it over and that's
when you make the money.

469
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,089
But the pressure...

470
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:55,633
...man, it's like...

471
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:58,928
You OK?

472
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:01,722
I'm not OK.
Don't tell anybody.

473
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:03,766
Listen to me.

474
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,812
- I feel like I'm getting crushed and...
- Crushed by what?

475
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,856
Everything.
The family, the baby, the job,

476
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:14,276
the fucking dicks at work,
and it's like, you know,

477
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:18,781
like I'm trying to do this,
you know, and then I'm like...

478
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:21,700
- ...suffocating.
- Holy shit.

479
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:24,078
You can't be happy all the time.

480
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:25,830
- Who told you you can't be happy?
- It's all right.

481
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,040
You just do your best,
you have no choice.

482
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,834
- That's not true at all.
- You just can't.

483
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,418
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie...

484
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,629
I hope you're OK with veronica's
sister coming over.

485
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:36,298
- You OK with that?
- Who?

486
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:37,842
veronica's sister.

487
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,718
- tiffany. tiffany and Tommy?
- tiffany.

488
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:42,763
- Yeah. Just tiffany.
- What happened to Tommy?

489
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,682
- He died.
- Tommy died?

490
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,767
- Cops die.
- How'd he die?

491
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,644
- Please, don't bring it up.
- No, how did he die?

492
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,146
- I just said...
- How did who die?

493
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:57,945
Hey, tiffany. This is Pat.
Pat, my sister-in-law, tiffany.

494
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:03,200
You look nice.

495
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,411
- Thank you.
- I'm not flirting with you.

496
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,372
- Oh, I didn't think you were.
- I just see that you made an effort

497
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,416
and I'm gonna be better with my wife,
I'm working on that.

498
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:12,543
I wanna acknowledge her beauty.

499
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,045
I never used to do that.
I'm gonna do that now.

500
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,464
'Cause we're gonna be
better than ever, nikki.

501
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:19,842
Just practicing.
How'd Tommy die?

502
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,179
What about your job?

503
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:27,600
- I just got fired, actually.
- Oh, really? How?

504
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,394
I mean, I'm sorry.
How'd that happen?

505
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,397
Does it really matter?

506
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,859
Baby, how's it going?

507
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:39,320
- Great, great.
- Everyone having fun?

508
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,907
I love flowers. Baby, can we
show them the house? Please, please...?

509
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,075
- The whole house?
- The whole house, yeah.

510
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,203
I think it'll be fun. it'll be fun.
We're gonna go on a tour now.

511
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,956
- Let's go see the house.
- Let's go for the tour.

512
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:53,125
I've been planning
this forever. I love our house.

513
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:55,878
I love our house.
I'm really excited about it.

514
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,796
Come on.

515
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:00,424
- Guess what it is.
- Oh, it's a television.

516
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,718
- It's a computer screen.
- Nope.

517
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,637
- Keep going, keep going.
- It's a brick oven.

518
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,513
- It's a light.
- Ooh! Warmer, warmer.

519
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:07,932
- Don't think so hard.
- It's a drawer at a morgue

520
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,434
where they pull out dead bodies
and shoot them with formaldehyde.

521
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,312
- Where would the body go, though?
- It's a joke.

522
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,399
It's a... fireplace.

523
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,610
In the middle of the wall?

524
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,779
We have a port in every room.
Gimme an iPod.

525
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,531
- I don't have an iPod.
- Who doesn't have an iPod?

526
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,867
Well, I don't have an iPod.
I don't even have a phone.

527
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,328
They won't let me make any calls.
They think I'm gonna call nikki.

528
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,205
Don't worry about it.
Don't focus on her.

529
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,582
- I would call nikki.
- I'm actually gonna give you

530
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,751
- one of my iPods. I have an old one.
- Gimme your iPod.

531
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,211
Give it to me.
Thank you, baby, thank you.

532
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,879
- Look, look, look...
- Of all the rooms

533
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,589
that there are iPod ports in, I'm happy

534
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,383
you brought us into the bathroom.

535
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,259
I can play music
for the baby in any room.

536
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:46,387
Can you play Ride the Lightning
by Metallica?

537
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,602
Pat was a history sub
at the high school, tiffany.

538
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,688
Ask him about any president,
he knows 'em all.

539
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:59,566
Here's a fun fact. You know
where the term "OK" comes from?

540
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:02,152
- No. No, I don't.
- Where?

541
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,904
Well, Martin Van Buren,
the eighth president

542
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,824
of the United States of America,
is from Kinderhook, New York.

543
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,952
And he was part of a club,
a men's club, called Old Kinderhook.

544
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,830
And if you were cool,
you were in the club,

545
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,000
they'd say, "That guy's OK,"
'cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.

546
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,544
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

547
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:21,463
You know, tiffany's been doing
this dance thing for years

548
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,756
and she's real good at it.

549
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,384
She's gonna be competing
at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

550
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,845
Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
nikki loves dance.

551
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,263
Why do you have to talk
about me like that?

552
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:31,515
I'm just bragging about you.
Can't I brag about my little sister?

553
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,600
Don't talk about me in the third person.

554
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:36,437
- Please, gimme a break.
- I'm right here.

555
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:38,313
Just be nice. Just be nice.

556
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,232
Wow, wow. Fascinating.

557
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,026
Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

558
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,902
I know. I know, I know.

559
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:46,530
What meds are you on?

560
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,366
Me? None.

561
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,077
I used to be on Lithium
and Seroquel and Abilify,

562
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:54,455
but I don't take them anymore. No.

563
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:57,124
They make me foggy
and they also make me bloated.

564
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,543
Yeah, I was on Xanax
and Effexor,

565
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,795
but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,
so I stopped.

566
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,131
- You ever take Klonopin?
- Klonopin? Yeah.

567
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,758
- Right?
- Jesus.

568
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:08,260
- Like I said, "What? What day is it?"
- Yeah.

569
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:10,596
- How about Trazodone?
- Trazodone?

570
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:13,140
It flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.

571
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,892
It takes the light
right out of your eyes.

572
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,935
God, I bet it does.

573
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,319
- I'm tired. I wanna go.
- No. No, no, no, no.

574
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:29,281
We haven't even finished
the salad yet, or the duck.

575
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:30,741
I made the fire and ice cake.

576
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,035
I said I'm tired.

577
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:35,496
Are you gonna
walk me home or what?

578
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:38,749
You mean me?

579
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,667
Yeah, you. Are you
gonna walk me home?

580
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,463
You have poor social skills.
You have a problem.

581
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:45,714
- I have a problem?
- Hm-mm.

582
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:47,674
You say more inappropriate things
than appropriate things.

583
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:50,594
- You scare people.
- I tell the truth. But you're mean.

584
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,137
What? I'm not telling the truth?

585
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,850
Um, maybe I should
drive them home separately?

586
00:28:57,018 --> 00:29:00,020
You can drive them
both home. Now.

587
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,481
- Stop talking about me in third person.
- Take tiffany home first.

588
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,317
You love it when I have problems.
You love it. You love it, von.

589
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,819
Because then you can be
the good one. Just say it.

590
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,529
No, I don't. I don't.

591
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,615
- I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
- God.

592
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,492
What is your problem?

593
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,661
Nothing's my problem. I'm fine.
I'm tired and I wanna go.

594
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,080
- Come on, are you ready?
- You really wanna go right now?

595
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:19,957
Yes, I really wanna go.
It's been great.

596
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,500
OK, guys, the baby is sleeping.

597
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,377
Sorry. I don't wanna
wake up the baby. Bye.

598
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,587
Sorry, man.

599
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:42,396
This is me.

600
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:45,149
Listen, I haven't dated
since before my marriage,

601
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,192
so I don't really remember
how this works.

602
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,153
How what works?

603
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,656
I saw the way you
were looking at me, Pat.

604
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,743
You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.
We're not liars like they are.

605
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:58,954
I live in the addition
around back,

606
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:01,039
which is completely
separate from my parents' house,

607
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,458
so there's no chance
of them walking in on us.

608
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,712
I hate the fact that you wore
a football jersey to dinner

609
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,966
because I hate football, but you can
fuck me if you turn the lights off, OK?

610
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,052
How old are you?

611
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,765
Old enough to have a marriage end
and not wind up in a mental hospital.

612
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,645
Look, I had a really
good time tonight,

613
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,398
and I think you're really
pretty, but I'm married, OK?

614
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,444
You're married?

615
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:32,988
So am I.

616
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:35,949
No, that's confusing. He's dead.

617
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:46,460
Wait, what? What's happening?

618
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,925
Oh, my God. Hey...

619
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,450
Are you OK? Ronnie called.

620
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:20,911
- Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?
- I don't know, Mom.

621
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,537
What happened over there?

622
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,957
- When am I gonna get a phone?
- You'll get a phone in due time.

623
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:26,291
- What happened?
- Pat!

624
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:53,819
Mom? Mom? Mom? I can't find
my wedding video. Mom, wake up.

625
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:55,404
- What is it?
- Where's my wedding video?

626
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:57,406
It's after 3:00!
What are you doing?

627
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:58,949
I looked in here, but this is
all your shit up here

628
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,492
for your sewing and everything.

629
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,495
Well, what about
in your father's study?

630
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:06,498
- Don't go in my study.
- Dad, not now!

631
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,500
Would you put it in here? It makes
no sense for you to put it in here.

632
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:10,836
- Patty, what are you doing?
- He's got all his Eagles videos

633
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,963
and not one video of my wedding.
Is it here? I mean...?

634
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,507
- Patty!
- It's probably in the attic.

635
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:17,426
Are you going in my study?

636
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:20,512
It feels to me like you
wanna hide my wedding video.

637
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,681
You think I can't handle it?

638
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,016
Please stop yelling!

639
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:26,184
I'm not yelling,
Mom, I'm just frustrated

640
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,228
because I should have
my fucking wedding video!

641
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,897
Pat! Pat!
You're gonna wake everybody up!

642
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,483
- I already looked all over there!
- It's somewhere!

643
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,238
- Calm down, Pat.
- I'm not calming down!

644
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,449
I don't give a fuck who hears,
I'm not calming down!

645
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:42,534
Anybody can wake up!
I'm not ashamed of it!

646
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,036
Pat! Stop it!

647
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,330
Let the whole neighborhood
wake up! I don't care!

648
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,539
Stop it! Stop it!

649
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,291
- No, Mom!
- What's going on?

650
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:51,335
- Come right down!
- What?

651
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,003
- Stop it!
- Hey!

652
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,797
It's my wedding!
It's my wedding video!

653
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,841
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

654
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,385
I can't watch a video?! No!

655
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,721
I can hear this
fucking song in my head!

656
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,483
Stop!

657
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,154
Mom!

658
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:20,822
What the fuck you doing?!
You fucked your mother up!

659
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,409
- No, no!
- Stop it!

660
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,536
Get off me, Dad!

661
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,623
- Stop hitting him!
- I'm not doing anything!

662
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:33,210
Patrizio, stop hitting him!
Patrizio, don't hit him!

663
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,589
- I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!
- Let him go!

664
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:41,927
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

665
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:46,390
Police!
Open the door, please. Open up.

666
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,935
Mr. Solatano, I got a lot of calls.
People in the neighborhood are scared.

667
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,645
I gotta come in.

668
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:53,772
How are we doing in here, huh?

669
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,983
We've heard a lot of reports
from your neighbors, all right?

670
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:59,611
nikki is being manipulated
and controlled. You have to talk to her.

671
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,571
- Hey, sit down.
- Officer...

672
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,281
You gotta stop
with these crazy theories.

673
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:04,825
He's a cop. What are you doing?

674
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,827
It's a medication problem,
but he's fine.

675
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,787
He's fine now? You wanna
send him back to Baltimore?

676
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:11,164
We know all about the explosion
at the psychiatrist's office.

677
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:13,750
What explosion? No.
Cliff is lying, that's not true.

678
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,752
He's not allowed to talk about that.

679
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,172
- Jesus Christ, who's that?
- Keep an eye on him.

680
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,841
Is this a bipolar episode?

681
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,135
Get out of here,
you little fucking idiot!

682
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,469
- Get outta here!
- Help me!

683
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,012
You can't tell nikki
about this, Officer.

684
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,222
Look, I gotta make out a report.

685
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,142
- No, no! No!
- Sit down.

686
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,061
This guy's chasing me! Help me!

687
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,230
- Sit down!
- Sorry, I could write you a letter.

688
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,190
Just let me have five minutes,
explain how much better I'm doing.

689
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,109
Five hundred feet. Listen to me!

690
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,694
I'll take that fucking camera

691
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,696
and I'm gonna break it
over your fucking head.

692
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,990
Then I'm gonna come back
and interview you about what it's like

693
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,200
to get that fucking camera
broken over your head!

694
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:48,660
What are you laughing about?

695
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:50,954
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

696
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,831
Stop all that fucking noise!

697
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,126
Go back to sleep.
The party's over. Show's over.

698
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,794
This is not a reflection
of where I'm at.

699
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,212
Please, you can't tell her any of this.

700
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,173
- You can't tell nikki about this.
- You need to pipe down.

701
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,382
Everything all right?

702
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,301
- Who was at the door?
- Who was that, Dad?

703
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,219
It was that kid
with the camera.

704
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:07,929
Good luck. I gotta write this up.

705
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,973
Don't write it up.
I don't want her to see this.

706
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,476
It's OK, everything
is OK. We're fine.

707
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,395
Thank you, we appreciate it.
Thank you.

708
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,451
- Hey!
- Whoa! Hey!

709
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,827
What the hell?

710
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:17,082
- What happened to your face?
- Weight lifting accident.

711
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,876
That sounds like bullshit.

712
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,670
Why'd you run by my house?

713
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:24,089
Did our little conversation
get you upset last night?

714
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:26,132
Hey, this is my route, OK?
Just back off.

715
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,009
This is my neighborhood.
You just ran by my house.

716
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:31,096
- I like to run by myself, OK?
- Me too.

717
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:32,847
Hey, I like to run alone!
Will you stop?

718
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:35,183
- OK? I'm running here!
- What?! Me too!

719
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,601
Well then, why don't you run
somewhere else?

720
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:38,937
There's fucking tons of roads to run in!
What are you trying to do?

721
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:40,564
I like this road.
This is my neighborhood.

722
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,692
- Oh, come on, please!
- Calm down, crazy.

723
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,319
Why are you...?

724
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,587
What the fuck?

725
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,715
Damn it!

726
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,677
- Hey!
- What the fuck?!

727
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,762
- I'm married!
- So am I!

728
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,056
What the fuck are you doing?
Your husband's dead!

729
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:17,434
- Where is your wife?
- You're crazy!

730
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,312
I'm not the one that just got
out of that hospital in Baltimore.

731
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,855
I'm not the big slut!

732
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:28,194
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

733
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:30,739
I was a big slut,
but I'm not anymore.

734
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,450
There's always gonna be a part
of me that's sloppy and dirty,

735
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,411
but I like that,
with all the other parts of myself.

736
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,580
Can you say the same
about yourself, fucker?

737
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:41,583
Can you forgive?
Are you any good at that?

738
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,882
You seemed to have trouble last night.

739
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,717
Let me just set the record
straight about last night.

740
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:53,553
Hurting my mother was a mistake
and I hate myself for it,

741
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,889
and I hate my illness
and I want to control it.

742
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,849
My father, on the other hand,
had no trouble

743
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:00,685
slapping the shit out of me last night,
which I did not return,

744
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,062
because I could've
killed him and I didn't.

745
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:04,522
He's 65 years old. You don't think
I could've beat the shit out of him?

746
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,233
He was scared for your mother
and you hurt him as well.

747
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,611
Yes, last night was a mess. OK?

748
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:11,863
And I think he probably
just tried to do his best.

749
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,533
Pat, you have to have
a strategy. I told you earlier.

750
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,786
You need to recognize
these feelings coming to you,

751
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:19,913
otherwise you will
be sent back to Baltimore.

752
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,999
So when you get these feelings,
you need to get to a quieter place,

753
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,002
make peace with yourself,
however you can.

754
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,712
Yeah, but that's
easier said than done.

755
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,174
You have to do it.
You have no choice. Excelsior.

756
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:33,677
Yeah, Excelsior.

757
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,846
Listen, I have a letter
I want you to give nikki, OK?

758
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,765
- No.
- Why?

759
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,308
Because you have a restraining order.

760
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:44,187
What good are you, man?

761
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,773
Why did you have
this overwhelming urgency

762
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,900
- to see your wedding video last night?
- Oh, I don't know.

763
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:50,985
Because I'm married and I haven't seen
my wife in eight and a half months.

764
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:54,906
Maybe you think that nikki's not around
and tiffany's an attractive girl,

765
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,700
and if you get drawn
towards tiffany,

766
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,993
you will spoil your chances
of getting nikki back to you?

767
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:01,162
Not bad, Dr. Jones.

768
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,874
But I don't think I'm gonna blow
it with nikki because tiffany's a slut.

769
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,502
- Why is she a slut?
- After the dinner at Ronnie's,

770
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,338
she said, quote,
"We can go to the back house

771
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:13,800
and you can fuck me
as long as we turn the lights out."

772
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:17,846
Unquote. And she still
wears her wedding ring.

773
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:20,724
So she's a loyal,
married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

774
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:24,728
Maybe she just needs a friend
and she thought if she offers you sex,

775
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,980
it will be easier for you
to become friends with her.

776
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:30,066
She said she's
not a whore anymore.

777
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:34,904
But she likes that part of herself along
with all the other parts of herself,

778
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,907
- and can I say the same?
- Can you?

779
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,828
Is that? You're asking me...
you're really asking me that question?

780
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,329
Yes.

781
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,958
All my crazy sad shit?
What, are you fucking nuts?

782
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:52,338
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
I'm just giving back your words to you.

783
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:56,634
This "crazy sad shit," as you call it,
made you a happier, calmer person

784
00:39:56,802 --> 00:40:00,180
with a beautiful positive philosophy
of going outdoors,

785
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:03,975
- working out, and reading books.
- No. No, not the books.

786
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:07,729
You said nikki is friends
with Ronnie, veronica and tiffany.

787
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:09,981
So if you become friends with tiffany,

788
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:13,443
nikki will think that you're
a kind, generous, large-hearted person,

789
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,322
who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving.

790
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,992
So, if you help tiffany,
it will be good for you.

791
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:26,831
Trick or treat!

792
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:31,461
Trick or treat!

793
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,723
- Hey!
- Oh!

794
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:48,686
- How do you know when I run?
- I wanted to clarify something.

795
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,564
I just want us to be friends.

796
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:53,942
Did you hear what I said?

797
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:58,613
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

798
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:02,408
No, I'm not giving you
a hard time.

799
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,996
I don't know how to act
with you when you do this shit.

800
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,583
You wanna have dinner at this diner?

801
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,548
Pick me up at 7:30.

802
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:22,428
- Trick or treat!
- Wait up!

803
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,919
Happy Halloween.

804
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,296
Hi.

805
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,403
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

806
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,781
I'm gonna get a bowl
of your Raisin Bran.

807
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,283
Great.

808
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:29,078
Tea.

809
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,540
Be right up.

810
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:38,755
You look nice.

811
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,715
Thanks.

812
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,969
Raisin Bran.

813
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,846
Here's some milk for you.

814
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,058
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

815
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,824
Do you want to share this?

816
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,077
Why did you order Raisin Bran?

817
00:43:10,746 --> 00:43:12,288
Why did you order tea?

818
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:15,667
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

819
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,543
I ordered Raisin Bran because I
didn't want there to be

820
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:19,963
any mistaking it for a date.

821
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,757
It can still be a date
if you order Raisin Bran.

822
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:24,759
It's not a date.

823
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:28,763
So how's your thing going?
Dancing thing?

824
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:30,556
It's good.
How's your restraining order?

825
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:32,976
I wouldn't actually call
the restraining order "my thing,"

826
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:38,064
but... getting back with nikki is,
and I think I'm doing pretty well.

827
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:40,191
Except for a minor incident
at the doctor's office.

828
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:42,568
And the so-called
incident with the weights.

829
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,363
Yeah. That was the thing
with my parents.

830
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:48,616
I wish I could just explain it
all in a letter to nikki,

831
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:51,369
because it was minor
and I could just explain it,

832
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:54,122
and let her know that
I'm actually not out of control...

833
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,876
...and that I'm actually
doing really well.

834
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:08,428
I can get a letter to nikki.

835
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:11,305
I see her sometimes
with my sister.

836
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,357
It would be so amazing

837
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,985
if you could get a letter
to nikki from me.

838
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:27,947
I'd have to hide it from veronica.
She's not into breaking the law,

839
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,658
which this letter would
definitely be doing.

840
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,162
But you would do it?

841
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:37,498
I'd have to be careful.

842
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,251
I'm already on thin ice
with my family.

843
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:42,545
You should hear
how I lost my job.

844
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,630
How did you lose your job?

845
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:45,965
By...

846
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,012
...having sex
with everybody in the office.

847
00:44:52,264 --> 00:44:54,223
Everybody?

848
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,477
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.

849
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:59,771
- We don't have to talk about it.
- Thanks.

850
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:01,481
- How many were there?
- Eleven.

851
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:03,858
- Wow.
- I know.

852
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,570
- I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
- OK.

853
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,490
Can I ask you
one more question?

854
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,494
Were there any women?

855
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:17,205
- Yes.
- Really?

856
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:19,165
Yes.

857
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,833
What was that like?

858
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,170
- Hot.
- Jesus Christ.

859
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:29,509
Was it like older women,

860
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:32,345
a sexy teacher,
who wants to seduce you...

861
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,972
Made me sit on her lap
and do things? Yeah.

862
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:39,894
- What? You sat on her lap?
- Mm-hm.

863
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:42,522
- She told you what to do?
- Mm-hm.

864
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:44,524
Oh, my God.

865
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,194
nikki hated when I talked like this.
It made me feel like such a perv.

866
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,822
- Maybe we should change the subject.
- I don't mind it.

867
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,282
You don't, do you?

868
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,535
No.

869
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,995
But then people were getting in fights

870
00:45:58,163 --> 00:46:02,291
in the parking lot at work,
and in the bathroom,

871
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,169
and the boss called me
in to his office,

872
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:07,463
and tried to pin it all on me.

873
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,758
So I accused him of harassment,

874
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:12,802
and then they fired me,

875
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,180
sent me home and put me
on some meds.

876
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,182
I get it.

877
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,728
The song that was playing
when my wife...

878
00:46:22,896 --> 00:46:24,730
...was in the shower
with the history teacher...

879
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:27,608
- I heard about that.
- ...It was my wedding song and...

880
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:29,110
...when I hear it,
I go kinda crazy.

881
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:32,196
Sometimes I hear it
when it's not even playing.

882
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:34,782
- Wow.
- Yeah.

883
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,702
So they put me on medication,
which I feel ashamed of.

884
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,537
Yeah.

885
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:42,832
- So I know.
- You do.

886
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,293
I just gotta
get a strategy, you know?

887
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:47,920
Me too.

888
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:49,380
We'd better get
back to the letter.

889
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:51,465
Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

890
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:54,886
What if you told nikki when
veronica was in the bathroom?

891
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:58,472
Yes. Yes, that could work.

892
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:00,433
I love that.

893
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,643
Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home
and write the letter right now.

894
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:05,104
Can I at least finish my tea?

895
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,273
- Wait, what?
- My tea. Can I finish it?

896
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,317
Wait a minute.

897
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:11,527
Did veronica tell nikki
about our dinner?

898
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,862
Why would she do that?

899
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,490
- Was it a test?
- I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

900
00:47:16,658 --> 00:47:20,411
Goddamn it, I knew it.
It was a test.

901
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:22,663
How did I do?
I think I did pretty well.

902
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:24,874
Yeah, she said you
were cool, basically.

903
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:29,212
"Basically"? Was I some
percentage not cool?

904
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,131
No, she said you were cool,
but you know...

905
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,009
No, I don't know.

906
00:47:35,844 --> 00:47:39,222
Sort of how you are.
It's fine, relax.

907
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,265
What do you mean? How am I?
What does that mean?

908
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,060
Sort of like me.

909
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,270
Sort of like you?

910
00:47:46,438 --> 00:47:48,856
I hope to God
she didn't tell nikki that.

911
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,860
- Why?
- Because...

912
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:56,864
...it's just not right,
lumping you and I together.

913
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,577
I mean, it's just wrong.
And nikki wouldn't like that.

914
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,580
Especially after all the shit
you just told me.

915
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,292
You think that I'm crazier than you.

916
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,336
Well, because...

917
00:48:12,714 --> 00:48:13,965
Well, we're different, I mean...

918
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,260
Oh, my God.

919
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,806
You're killing me.

920
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:29,313
You know what?
Forget I offered to help you.

921
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,857
Forget the entire fucking idea.

922
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:34,610
'Cause that must have been
fucking crazy

923
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,280
because I am so much
crazier than you.

924
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,698
Keep your voice down.

925
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,784
I am just the crazy slut
with a dead husband!

926
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,037
- Forget it!
- Shut the fuck up.

927
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:47,540
Fuck you!

928
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,625
- You shut the fuck up!
- tiffany! Hey, tiffany!

929
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:55,423
Go get her, man!

930
00:49:00,345 --> 00:49:01,762
Slow down, Raisin Bran.

931
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,807
Hey! Hey, come on.

932
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,309
Look, I don't
think you're crazy, all right?

933
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,894
Yes, you do.
You told your therapist

934
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:12,273
that you were in a superior
mental illness category, didn't you?

935
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:14,692
- Hey, calm down!
- Just leave me alone!

936
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,403
Can I just explain myself, please?

937
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:19,864
I didn't want nikki to think that
I was associated with that kind

938
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:22,366
of sexual behavior because
I've never done anything like that, OK?

939
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:25,494
You may not have experienced
the shit that I did,

940
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,330
but you loved hearing
about it, didn't you?

941
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,626
You are afraid to be alive.
You are afraid to live.

942
00:49:32,794 --> 00:49:36,005
You're a hypocrite.
You're a conformist. You're a liar.

943
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:39,717
I opened up to you and you
judged me. You are an asshole.

944
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:41,594
- You are an asshole!
- Hey, calm down.

945
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:44,096
Get off of me! Get off!
You're harassing me!

946
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:46,849
- He's harassing me!
- Hey, hey... Shut up!

947
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:51,520
- Get off!
- Man, take it easy. Dude, relax.

948
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,564
- He is harassing me!
- Bro, get off me, dude.

949
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:56,233
- He's harassing me!
- Hey, stop, stop.

950
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,736
- Just back off, all right?
- I'll fuck you up!

951
00:49:58,904 --> 00:50:01,280
- Go home!
- Hey, get off of me!

952
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:04,325
- Shut up, shut up. Stop it.
- Shut up!

953
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:16,462
- Hey, hey, get off me!
- What are you doing?

954
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,173
Come on. What are you doing?
What are you doing to these kids?

955
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:21,300
Are you gonna be a punk on
Halloween with these kids?

956
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:23,761
You wanna go back to Baltimore?
Is that what you wanna do?

957
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,097
Come on, Solatano.
What did these kids do to you?

958
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:28,265
You're begging to go back to
Baltimore, you know that, right?

959
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:30,893
What's the matter with you, huh?
You're sick.

960
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,979
It's the kids. It's the kids.
Honestly, he didn't do anything.

961
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:38,442
It was all the kids. They started it.
He didn't do anything.

962
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,194
Come on, man.
Come here, come here.

963
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:41,987
What are you gonna do about that song?

964
00:50:42,155 --> 00:50:44,365
You're gonna go your whole life
scared of that song?

965
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:48,702
It's a song. Don't make it a monster.
Come on, breathe.

966
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,871
There's no song.
There's no song.

967
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:53,874
There's no song playing.

968
00:51:00,006 --> 00:51:03,092
That's it.

969
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,345
That's it.
Do it more. There you go.

970
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:10,099
- Move it out. Let's go.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

971
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,769
- I'm sorry.
- I took it too far.

972
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,729
Hey, is he messing with you?

973
00:51:15,897 --> 00:51:18,399
- No, no. This was just a joke.
- Don't defend the abuser.

974
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,234
- I'm not.
- There's a restraining order...

975
00:51:20,402 --> 00:51:21,861
I know,
I have a stupid sense of humor.

976
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:23,988
- That's not a good thing to do.
- Well, I'm fucked up.

977
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:26,323
- What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
- You're Tommy's widow, right?

978
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:28,367
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow.

979
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:30,286
Minus the whore thing
for the most part.

980
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:34,665
You're a funny girl.
You wanna get a drink sometime?

981
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,671
- What'd I say?
- She doesn't do that anymore.

982
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,977
I'm sorry about what I said
in the diner.

983
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,313
I know.
I know you didn't mean it.

984
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,898
I didn't mean it at all.

985
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:00,691
I know, you say shit
you don't mean all the time.

986
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:01,859
All the time.

987
00:52:02,027 --> 00:52:04,445
I'll still give your letter to nikki,
don't worry.

988
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:08,157
Wow. I really appreciate that, tiffany.

989
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,951
- I know you do.
- You do?

990
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:14,413
Yeah, sure.

991
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:19,835
I'll see you tomorrow?
With the letter?

992
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:25,049
I'll bet I know what happened,
if only one is missing.

993
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:29,178
Either dolores or Pat needed
an envelope and one of them took it.

994
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,430
That's the only answer.

995
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:35,601
dolores? Somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?

996
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:37,311
Somebody took an envelope.

997
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,272
Maybe we should call the FBI.

998
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,192
No, don't make fun.
It's serious. What FBI?

999
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,444
Come on, take a look.
I'll show you what this is.

1000
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:48,572
I'm gonna just explain to you something.
I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey.

1001
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,200
This is everything, like this.
I got this, it all corresponds.

1002
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,160
Dad, I borrowed one of your
envelopes. I hope that's not a problem.

1003
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:55,579
No, it's not OK...

1004
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,040
"Do not go in my study
or I will eat you!"

1005
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,500
It's not funny.
It's not funny.

1006
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:01,585
What's everybody making a joke
out of this for?

1007
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:05,089
- dolores, you are so beautiful!
- Stop that!

1008
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:07,466
Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

1009
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:11,595
Listen. A lot of envelopes go in and
out of my office every day after games

1010
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:13,681
with a lot of cash in them,
so show some respect for what I do.

1011
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:16,141
Yeah, I know. I saw 274.
I just wanted to tell you the number.

1012
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:17,768
- Thank you.
- The envelope was empty.

1013
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:19,270
I'm sorry, you were sleeping
I didn't wanna wake you,

1014
00:53:19,437 --> 00:53:21,981
- but I needed an envelope.
- You didn't want to wake me?

1015
00:53:22,148 --> 00:53:24,233
He didn't want to wake me.
He doesn't have a problem

1016
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,902
complaining about
Ernest fucking Hemingway,

1017
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,529
- or asking for his wedding video.
- Be nice. It's game day!

1018
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:30,239
I'm making crabby snacks
and homemades.

1019
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,949
Yeah, come on, Dad. Be nice.

1020
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:34,285
Come on, she's making crabby
snacks and homemades.

1021
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:36,203
Come on, Dad!

1022
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:38,247
What are you so up about?

1023
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,040
- You're very happy.
- I'm happy.

1024
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,543
- No, you're so up, up, up.
- Isn't that a good thing?

1025
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:45,462
No, you're just up, up, up.
I don't know what that is.

1026
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,507
Are you taking the proper
dosage of your medication?

1027
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:50,301
Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.

1028
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:54,054
OK. Taking a little bit
too many or something?

1029
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:56,307
No, if I was taking that,
I'd be on the floor, Dad.

1030
00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:59,143
Just stay with us. Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.

1031
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,894
Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready
to go. What do you mean?

1032
00:54:01,062 --> 00:54:03,939
- Spend family time.
- Wait, you mean OCD superstitious time?

1033
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,358
Come on, your dad
needs a winner. Help him out.

1034
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:07,985
- Come on.
- I can't.

1035
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:11,780
It's the Seahawks.
Put on the jersey and stay, please.

1036
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,658
Please. It's important, please.

1037
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:16,785
- What are you up to, Pat?
- Nothing, come on.

1038
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,704
What's in the envelope?

1039
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:20,706
Yeah, what are you doing?
What's in that envelope?

1040
00:54:20,874 --> 00:54:23,208
Guys, I'm beating the song!
I'm on the scoreboard!

1041
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:26,712
I'm playing down field!
I feel great!

1042
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:31,634
tiffany!

1043
00:54:39,934 --> 00:54:42,853
Hey, hey, how you doing?
ls tiffany here?

1044
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,564
- What do you want with her?
- Is that another creep?

1045
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:48,817
- What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
- No, no, no. I'm married.

1046
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,611
Oh, great, a married creep.

1047
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:52,696
I'm her friend. We go running.
Have you guys not seen it?

1048
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:54,281
- I took her to the diner.
- She's not here.

1049
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:56,492
Hi, guys. How's it going?
ls tiffany home?

1050
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,327
- Go away.
- I know her.

1051
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,704
- What are you doing here?
- We've dated. We still date.

1052
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:02,456
- I've called her, texted.
- You know this guy?

1053
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:03,749
I still haven't heard back.

1054
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,125
- We used to work together...
- Just get the hell out of here.

1055
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:07,336
I just wanted to give you
my card to give to her.

1056
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,755
- Listen to what he's saying.
- What is he saying?

1057
00:55:09,923 --> 00:55:11,298
- He's saying you're being rude.
- How am I being rude?

1058
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:12,758
You know. Come on now.

1059
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:15,010
Look, sometimes it's OK
with girls like this,

1060
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,137
they wanna have fun,
and sometimes it's not,

1061
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,556
because they got a broken wing and
they're hurt and they're an easy target.

1062
00:55:19,724 --> 00:55:21,558
In this case, this particular case,

1063
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:23,936
I think that that wing
is being fixed, my friend.

1064
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:25,604
And you gotta make sure
it gets mended.

1065
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:27,314
You're getting in the way
of that right now, OK?

1066
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,525
Because she's sensitive
and she's smart, she's artistic.

1067
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,277
This is a great girl and
you gotta be respectful of that.

1068
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:35,072
Come on, let me walk you down to
your car. You're a better guy than this.

1069
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,824
- Look, I can see it in your eyes.
- She just texted me!

1070
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:50,295
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a second!
What are you doing?

1071
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:52,005
What happened?
How come... The letter?

1072
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:53,882
- You weren't outside?
- I can't do it.

1073
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,884
What do you mean, you can't?
You can't do what?

1074
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,761
I can't give the letter to nikki.

1075
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:00,222
tiffany! What are you talking about?

1076
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,974
What do you mean you can't
give the letter to nikki?

1077
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:04,727
Because what am I getting in return?
What are you doing for me?

1078
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,479
You said if I wrote a letter,
you'd get it to nikki.

1079
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:10,482
I know, because I do this!
Time after time after time,

1080
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,317
I do all this shit
for other people,

1081
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:15,863
and then I wake up and I'm empty.
I have nothing.

1082
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,198
What are you talking about?
You seem like you're a tough girl to me.

1083
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:19,700
You just do things on your own.

1084
00:56:19,868 --> 00:56:22,661
I always get myself
in these fucking situations.

1085
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:25,914
I give everything to other
people and nobody ever... I never...

1086
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:30,085
I don't get what I want, OK?
I'm not my sister.

1087
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:38,510
All right, well, ask for you.
What can I do for you?

1088
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,847
I... I can't do it.

1089
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:43,974
tiffany, what do you
want me to do?

1090
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:48,103
- Think of something.
- There's this thing.

1091
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,606
There's a thing, OK.
What kind of thing?

1092
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:54,568
It's a thing, it's a thing.
It's a dance thing.

1093
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:56,779
- It's a dance thing, all right.
- It's a competition thing

1094
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,072
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.
Tommy would never do it...

1095
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,866
Tommy's dead,
so he's not gonna fucking do it.

1096
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,910
- Would you please...?
- I don't have a filter when I talk.

1097
00:57:03,077 --> 00:57:04,870
I know you don't have a filter.
Can we have one fucking conversation

1098
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:07,039
without you reminding me
that my goddamn my husband is dead?

1099
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,541
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1100
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:12,002
But I can only do it
if I have a partner.

1101
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,004
And now I'm about to miss it
for another year.

1102
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,881
Wait, I'm not gonna
fucking dance with you.

1103
00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:19,301
- What are you talking about?
- What? Your schedule is so busy?

1104
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,637
Grapes of Wrath and watching
football with your dad?

1105
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,222
I'm not gonna do a dance with you.

1106
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:24,765
Well, I'm not giving her
your fucking letter.

1107
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:27,142
Wait a second. But you promised
you would do this.

1108
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,269
Think about it.

1109
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:31,271
Well, I already did do
something for you, you know.

1110
00:57:31,439 --> 00:57:34,358
- What did you do for me?
- I took care of that jerkoff

1111
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:36,360
- that was in front of your house.
- What? Jordie?

1112
00:57:36,528 --> 00:57:38,612
Let me ask you something.
You call him when you're lonely?

1113
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,574
That encourages him, tiffany,
and you shouldn't do it.

1114
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:44,535
Couldn't you say the same
about you and nikki?

1115
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:46,703
It's not at all like me and nikki.
What are you talking about?

1116
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:48,831
We're in love and we're married.
It's completely different.

1117
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,292
How are you in love?
Tell me about that.

1118
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,547
The big nikki love. Tell me about it,
I wanna understand it.

1119
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:58,674
We have a very
unconventional chemistry,

1120
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,926
it makes people feel awkward,
but not me.

1121
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:03,178
All right? She's the most beautiful
woman I've ever been with.

1122
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,889
- Wow.
- It's electric between us.

1123
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:08,392
OK? Yeah, we wanna
change each other, but that's normal.

1124
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,143
Couples wanna do that.

1125
00:58:10,311 --> 00:58:11,895
I want her to stop
dressing like she dresses,

1126
00:58:12,063 --> 00:58:13,981
and I want her to stop acting
so superior to me, OK?

1127
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:16,275
And she wanted me to lose weight
and stop my mood swings,

1128
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:17,526
which both I've done.

1129
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:20,404
I mean, people fight.
Couples fight.

1130
00:58:20,572 --> 00:58:22,155
We would fight, we wouldn't
talk for a couple weeks.

1131
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:23,574
That's normal.

1132
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:24,992
- She always wanted the best for me.
- Wow.

1133
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:27,494
She wanted me to be
passionate and compassionate.

1134
00:58:27,662 --> 00:58:29,162
And that's a good thing.
You know?

1135
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,124
Look, I'm my best self today,
and I think she's her best self today

1136
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,667
and our love's gonna
be fucking amazing.

1137
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:35,752
It's gonna be amazing,
and you're gonna be amazing,

1138
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,754
and she's gonna be amazing,
and you're not gonna be that guy

1139
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:39,214
that's gonna take advantage
of a situation

1140
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,258
without offering
to do something back.

1141
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:43,510
So think about the dance thing.

1142
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:52,311
Danny,
you're out of the hospital?

1143
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:53,979
- And you're here on game day?
- I'm out.

1144
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:56,398
It's official, man.

1145
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,776
They didn't convert me to my Mental
Hygiene Law admission status

1146
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:03,947
within two-thirds of the maximum length
of my felony sentence, so I'm out.

1147
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:06,241
They had to let me go.

1148
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,492
I never understand what he's saying.

1149
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,453
OK, jailhouse lawyer,
come on, let's come back

1150
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:11,538
and sit down
the way you were before.

1151
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:15,375
What a treat!
Dad's got you sitting here?

1152
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:17,377
- Oh, yeah.
- He calls me "jailhouse lawyer."

1153
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:19,546
Hold the remote the way
you were holding it before.

1154
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:21,173
And now you're
holding the remote?

1155
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:23,258
And it's working.
Your dad's a genius.

1156
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,553
- Now sit up, but like...
- And Danny's a good luck charm?

1157
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:29,514
Danny's from you. This is
your house, so it comes down to you.

1158
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:31,308
- You're the one.
- Yeah, you're the one, Pat.

1159
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,018
Superstition, Danny. I don't know.

1160
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:34,519
Come sit down.

1161
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:36,980
Don't disappear doing God knows what
with that tiffany Maxwell.

1162
00:59:37,148 --> 00:59:40,067
Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?

1163
00:59:40,234 --> 00:59:43,862
Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful.
She goes to a lot of therapy.

1164
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,989
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
What are you trying to say?

1165
00:59:46,157 --> 00:59:47,449
- I'm just saying...
- Am I messed up?

1166
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,952
Why don't you stop judging people?
You judge everybody.

1167
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,244
You're the one who has
a messed up marriage.

1168
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:53,288
- I'm just looking out for you.
- What's wrong with your marriage?

1169
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,123
She's unstable. Nothing.

1170
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,708
You should have seen
when I was at his house.

1171
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,043
- It's like a circus over there.
- Shh...

1172
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,544
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna hide this.

1173
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:02,047
- You need to deal with it.
- Stop breaking my balls.

1174
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:03,799
- I got you... I brought the iPod.
- Oh!

1175
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,969
- Whoa! Is this for me?
- Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but...

1176
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,930
Buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you. Wow.

1177
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:11,890
- Thirty-two gigabytes.
- How many songs is that?

1178
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:13,976
Seven thousand.

1179
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,186
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers.

1180
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:19,731
- Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
- Got some Clash.

1181
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,316
Oh, West Side Story.

1182
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,694
Yeah, West Side Story.
It makes me peaceful.

1183
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,779
- ♪ I just met a girl named Maria ♪
- Right, right, right.

1184
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:28,198
And then when I'm angry,
which is a lot these days,

1185
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:30,200
I go to the garage...

1186
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:33,704
Metallica... Megadeth.

1187
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,585
- I start fucking smashing shit.
- You gotta get your marriage together.

1188
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:44,381
I start breaking shit
and I hurt my hand.

1189
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:46,550
- And I...
- Ronnie, that's fucked up.

1190
01:00:46,718 --> 01:00:50,095
Yeah, but it makes me feel better.
It's like my therapy, you know? But...

1191
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:53,223
When I'm with nikki,
I'm never gonna do stuff like that.

1192
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,851
Whoa, nikki?
What's all this about nikki?

1193
01:00:57,562 --> 01:00:59,563
A restraining order
is nothing to fool with, bro.

1194
01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:03,483
Holy shit, look at you!
You are ripped!

1195
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:05,902
You look absolutely amazing.
You feel good?

1196
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,404
- How you doing, Jake?
- Good.

1197
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:09,197
You look like Schwarzenegger,
man, in his prime.

1198
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,075
Didn't I say you wouldn't
recognize him?

1199
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:16,621
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't
come see you down at the hospital.

1200
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:20,208
You know how those places creep me out,
and the firm's been expanding.

1201
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,002
I've been helping
Pop with the restaurant 'cause

1202
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,379
he needs to have a legitimate business.
He needs a tax return.

1203
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,048
With all the money he's
making with his bookmaking,

1204
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,507
they're gonna come after him.

1205
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,010
And then it looks like
I'm gonna make partner at the firm.

1206
01:01:31,471 --> 01:01:33,722
What? I don't even know
what to say to you anymore.

1207
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:38,310
You lost your wife.
I'm getting engaged,

1208
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:40,979
and I wanna be able to tell
you about those kinds of things.

1209
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:45,233
You lost your house,
I'm getting a new house.

1210
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,737
You lost your job, things are
going great for me at the firm.

1211
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,740
Maybe stop talking about all the stuff
that's good for you and bad for him.

1212
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,534
Just, you know, leave it alone.
Leave it alone. We're watching the game.

1213
01:01:54,702 --> 01:02:00,248
You know what, I'm just gonna stop
talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth.

1214
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,004
As my friend Danny would say...

1215
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:13,970
...I got nothing
but love for you, brother.

1216
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:21,561
- That's right. That's right.
- That's nice.

1217
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:24,397
Well, thank God, finally.

1218
01:02:24,565 --> 01:02:27,692
- DeSean Jackson.
- Yeah. Did it fit?

1219
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,486
Yeah, I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.

1220
01:02:29,654 --> 01:02:31,780
Beautiful jersey.
I love that jersey.

1221
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,699
- veronica didn't like it.
- veronica hates the jersey.

1222
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:38,036
Whatever you do, watch out
for that restraining order, OK?

1223
01:02:38,204 --> 01:02:41,540
- Don't let tiffany get you in trouble.
- You're up to something, I know.

1224
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:44,835
People like tiffany or Danny or me,

1225
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:46,503
maybe we know something
that you guys don't know, OK?

1226
01:02:46,671 --> 01:02:48,255
Did you ever think about that?

1227
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:50,173
Maybe we understand something
because we're more...

1228
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:51,466
We have a sixth sense.
I mean, everybody's got it.

1229
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,843
Everybody's just
not in touch with it.

1230
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,261
- Oh, no.
- How you doing, Pat?

1231
01:02:54,428 --> 01:02:55,804
Oh, Jesus.

1232
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,430
I guess his sixth sense
forgot to tell him

1233
01:02:57,598 --> 01:02:58,682
the cops were coming.

1234
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,517
I'm taking him
back to the hospital.

1235
01:03:00,685 --> 01:03:02,310
What? No, he passed
his thing, right?

1236
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,939
First of all, check with
the latest legal development.

1237
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:09,151
Well, we got a call that they
did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law

1238
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,486
admission status by the deadline
of your sentence, so...

1239
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,739
Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan
or are you not an Eagles fan?

1240
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:17,242
- I'm an Eagles fan.
- Well then, what's the problem?

1241
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,786
He's not going anywhere. Just let him
finish the game, that's all.

1242
01:03:19,954 --> 01:03:23,373
The handkerchief is working.
We're killing the Seahawks, 27-10.

1243
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,543
What's the matter with you?
Let him stay, please.

1244
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:28,920
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, the handkerchief.

1245
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:31,631
And I'm glad that the Seahawks
are losing and we're winning,

1246
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:35,093
but I gotta take Danny McDaniels
back to Baltimore, all right?

1247
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:38,263
He can contest his case
from Baltimore.

1248
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:41,975
Not correct about the Mental
Hygiene Law. Not correct.

1249
01:03:42,143 --> 01:03:44,102
You guys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

1250
01:04:02,622 --> 01:04:05,040
I used the insurance money
to build this. I designed it.

1251
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,750
- Wow.
- All the floors are hard oak.

1252
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:09,419
It has good bounce for dancers.

1253
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:11,463
I'm not that great of a dancer,
but who cares?

1254
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:13,548
It's therapy and it's fun.

1255
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,884
And the walls are good,
'cause I can play music really loud

1256
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,636
without anybody hearing.

1257
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:19,804
- Where do you sleep?
- Upstairs.

1258
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:22,349
It's a garage,
I just renovated it.

1259
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:24,434
You know, I was thinking about
putting a ballet barre here.

1260
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:26,144
When are you gonna give it to her?

1261
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:28,438
What?

1262
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,483
The letter to nikki.

1263
01:04:32,944 --> 01:04:34,778
- Probably tonight.
- Really?

1264
01:04:34,946 --> 01:04:37,155
Ronnie and veronica and I,
we're gonna see her tonight.

1265
01:04:37,323 --> 01:04:39,115
Oh, I actually changed
the first paragraph.

1266
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:41,326
I did this thing about Shakespeare
and how it's very romantic,

1267
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:43,620
and that maybe in the future
if she wanted to go dancing,

1268
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:45,330
I can be able to do that
because of all the training that...

1269
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:47,958
- No, that's good, that's really good.
- I assume you're a good teacher.

1270
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,876
Maybe you can teach us both,
you know what I mean?

1271
01:04:50,044 --> 01:04:53,588
And I also mentioned how generous
it is of what I'm doing for you.

1272
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,466
- Yeah. It's really generous.
- You know, sort of being of service.

1273
01:04:56,634 --> 01:04:58,718
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- To your need.

1274
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:02,639
All right, let's start simple.
Start at that corner, walk towards me.

1275
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:04,516
Walk across the room.

1276
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,351
Can we do something else
besides the dance deal?

1277
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:07,852
Are you fucking kidding me?

1278
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,312
I'm good with a hammer.
You want me to fix something?

1279
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,940
- A deal is a deal.
- I know. OK.

1280
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,235
I was just suggesting that
maybe there's a better scenario.

1281
01:05:15,403 --> 01:05:17,570
Why don't you...

1282
01:05:17,738 --> 01:05:20,865
...walk towards me
like I'm nikki.

1283
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:24,494
And the only way to convey how much
you've missed me is by your walk.

1284
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:28,498
By your slow walk.
You can't talk.

1285
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:30,417
Only walk. Do it.

1286
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:33,253
- No. That's stupid.
- No walk, no letter.

1287
01:05:35,673 --> 01:05:39,467
Walk to me like I'm nikki, come on.
Do it. I'm nikki. Come on.

1288
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,261
You're not nikki.

1289
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:44,723
Don't look up until
you're halfway here.

1290
01:05:46,934 --> 01:05:50,812
That's right. Not yet.

1291
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:56,109
Yes.

1292
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,239
Do you feel that? That's emotion.

1293
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:02,824
I don't feel anything.

1294
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,830
Has anybody ever told you
how Tommy died?

1295
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,542
No.

1296
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:17,714
We were married for three years
and five days, and I loved him.

1297
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:21,551
But for the last couple months,
I just wasn't into sex at all.

1298
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:24,262
It just felt like...
we were so different,

1299
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,057
and I was depressed.
Some of that is just me.

1300
01:06:27,224 --> 01:06:28,892
Some of it was
he wanted me to have kids

1301
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,436
and I have a hard enough time
taking care of myself.

1302
01:06:31,604 --> 01:06:33,730
I don't think that makes me a criminal.

1303
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:40,653
Anyway... one night after dinner,

1304
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:43,656
he drove to Victoria's Secret
at King of Prussia Mall...

1305
01:06:45,326 --> 01:06:48,286
...and got some lingerie
to get something going.

1306
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:51,623
And on the way back, he stopped
on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire

1307
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:54,334
and he got hit by a car and killed.

1308
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:59,005
And the Victoria's Secret box
was still in the front seat.

1309
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:05,387
That's a feeling.

1310
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,479
OK, this is the waltz.
I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.

1311
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,389
Whoa! Slow down.

1312
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,183
- What?
- Your father wanted you to have this.

1313
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:00,770
Probably wants me to have
all his Eagles information.

1314
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:02,313
It's his living.

1315
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:04,816
Um...
Tell Dad thanks.

1316
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:07,652
Your father expects
to spend time with you, Pat.

1317
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:16,202
Football stays out
of this place,

1318
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,288
so does Lord of the Flies.

1319
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:20,790
No, no, no, what are you doing?
I'm behind on my syllabus.

1320
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:23,251
- I don't give a fuck.
- What the hell are you doing?

1321
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,629
Hey! Hey!
Did you just throw that outside?

1322
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:29,549
What? You're not gonna read
that shit on my time.

1323
01:10:29,717 --> 01:10:31,467
I can tell you all about
the Lord of the Flies.

1324
01:10:31,635 --> 01:10:33,511
It's a bunch of boys
on an island,

1325
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,513
and they have a conch,
they have a shell,

1326
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:38,224
and whoever has the conch
has the power and they can talk.

1327
01:10:38,392 --> 01:10:40,435
And if you don't have the conch,
then you don't have the power.

1328
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:43,187
And then there's a little chubby
boy and they call him Piggy,

1329
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:45,982
and they're really mean,
and then there's a murder.

1330
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:49,485
I mean, humanity is just nasty
and there's no silver lining.

1331
01:10:49,653 --> 01:10:52,989
Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.

1332
01:10:53,157 --> 01:10:55,533
Who's that?

1333
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:56,909
Hello? What the...?

1334
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:58,828
What are you doing here, man?

1335
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:02,332
If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,

1336
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:04,792
then your whole adjudication
is thrown out.

1337
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,336
- How'd you know we were here?
- I went by your parents' house

1338
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:08,004
looking for you
and they told me you was over here.

1339
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:09,672
Danny, this is tiffany.
tiffany, this is Danny.

1340
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,090
Pat told me about you.

1341
01:11:11,258 --> 01:11:13,718
- So is the girl that you wrote about?
- Yeah.

1342
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:16,012
What? He wrote about me?
I'm "the girl?"

1343
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,598
- He wrote about you, all right.
- What'd he say?

1344
01:11:18,766 --> 01:11:21,851
He said you guys was helping
each other out and you were nice

1345
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:24,062
and you had a mouth on you, but...

1346
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:26,272
- Whoa. Whoa. OK, OK.
- ...you're a little mouthy, but...

1347
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,566
No, please, tell me more
about what he said in the letter.

1348
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:30,360
Anything you wanna know, I'll just
tell you in the letter, it was nothing bad.

1349
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:31,903
It was just a very general letter.

1350
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,072
- Cool.
- She's fine.

1351
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,074
She is my friend with an "F."

1352
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:37,575
A capital "F."

1353
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,619
- She's fine.
- For "friend."

1354
01:11:39,787 --> 01:11:41,537
Hey, can I see what
you guys are doing?

1355
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:42,955
- Yeah.
- OK.

1356
01:11:43,123 --> 01:11:45,041
One, two...

1357
01:11:45,209 --> 01:11:47,210
- I like it. It's good, yeah.
- Do you?

1358
01:11:47,378 --> 01:11:49,170
And then this goes
into something else.

1359
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:53,174
- That's it?
- Why? What is it, what is it?

1360
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,967
- Can I say something? Do you mind?
- No.

1361
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,135
- You sure?
- Just say it.

1362
01:11:56,303 --> 01:11:57,512
- No, please.
- I think, Pat,

1363
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,389
you should be facing tiffany.

1364
01:11:59,556 --> 01:12:01,933
Let me show you, Pat,
let me show you what I mean.

1365
01:12:02,101 --> 01:12:04,310
You gotta come with
a little bit more soul, man.

1366
01:12:04,478 --> 01:12:05,603
You should move more hips.

1367
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:07,814
Just sort of come in,
Pat, come in like this.

1368
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:09,357
- OK.
- You know, give a little...

1369
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,734
You know? Yeah.
Can you move a little more hip?

1370
01:12:11,902 --> 01:12:13,569
Yeah, that's it.
Move 'em a bit more.

1371
01:12:13,737 --> 01:12:15,863
You could turn around, too.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1372
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:19,534
Yeah. You're pretty good.
Yeah. That's it.

1373
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:23,079
- Yeah.
- OK, we got it, we got it.

1374
01:12:23,247 --> 01:12:26,374
- OK. Let's see what you got.
- Yeah, we got it.

1375
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:29,085
Come on, Pat, come on.

1376
01:12:29,253 --> 01:12:31,838
A little bit more soul, Pat.

1377
01:12:32,005 --> 01:12:34,424
- Black it up, Pat.
- What does that mean?

1378
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:36,759
- You know damn well what it means.
- "Black it up?"

1379
01:12:36,927 --> 01:12:41,347
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea.

1380
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,811
Jump up, around. Circle around,

1381
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:48,771
around and around. Don't look back!

1382
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,692
Come get some, Pat.
Come get some.

1383
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:56,446
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1384
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:59,574
Back, back.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.

1385
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,660
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
Girl, you gotta move your junk.

1386
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:04,704
Pop! Pop your butt! Pop it!

1387
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:06,789
I gotta get out of here.
I gotta go see this girl, tanya.

1388
01:13:06,957 --> 01:13:08,583
- She lives on this side of town.
- Yeah, go see tanya.

1389
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,418
OK, man, hey.
I'm gonna be there, man.

1390
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,044
- I want you guys to win!
- OK.

1391
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:13,963
- Excelsior, Pat!
- Excelsior!

1392
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:16,340
That's my man. Let's go.

1393
01:13:17,509 --> 01:13:18,843
Patty...

1394
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:21,554
Patty.

1395
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,653
Hey, Patty...

1396
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:44,660
Patty. Where have you been?

1397
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:47,497
Huh?

1398
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:50,666
We got a serious situation
on our hands, you know that.

1399
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,213
We gotta beat the Giants

1400
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,673
if we wanna have any chance
of getting into the division,

1401
01:13:57,841 --> 01:14:00,051
any chance of playing
in the playoffs.

1402
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:02,762
Do you realize that?

1403
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,639
I didn't realize that.

1404
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,016
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.

1405
01:14:07,184 --> 01:14:11,646
I mean, I think it would be wise
if we spent father-son time

1406
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,857
reading about the Eagles,
talking about them.

1407
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:18,194
Just to strengthen
the good luck thing that you're in.

1408
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,823
- OK.
- Yeah?

1409
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:25,618
- All right.
- Hmm?

1410
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:38,714
I just wanted to...

1411
01:14:40,133 --> 01:14:41,384
Maybe I didn't...

1412
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:45,179
...spend enough time
with you growing up.

1413
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:49,475
I spent too much time
with your brother.

1414
01:14:49,643 --> 01:14:53,396
Ah, it might have made you feel worse
about your behavior, but I...

1415
01:14:53,564 --> 01:14:56,566
...I didn't know anything,
I didn't know how to handle it.

1416
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:00,278
I mean, that's what
all this Eagles stuff is about.

1417
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:04,782
It's about us...
spending time now.

1418
01:15:08,912 --> 01:15:12,290
I wanna do everything I can
to help you get back on your feet.

1419
01:15:12,457 --> 01:15:15,334
That's the whole point.

1420
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:17,712
Yeah.

1421
01:15:19,339 --> 01:15:21,507
I wish you'd watch
these games with me.

1422
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:25,970
'Cause then we could talk,
we could get into things.

1423
01:15:31,935 --> 01:15:36,022
So will you just come downstairs
and talk to me and Randy now? Huh?

1424
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:39,817
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

1425
01:15:39,985 --> 01:15:42,737
He's betting everything
on the Giant game. Everything.

1426
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,197
All the money that he needs
for the restaurant,

1427
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:47,158
he's betting on the Giant game.

1428
01:15:47,326 --> 01:15:50,411
- Tell him why.
- Because he believes in you.

1429
01:15:51,496 --> 01:15:54,540
- Is that true?
- I believe in you, Patty.

1430
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:58,044
I believe in you.
I want you to know that.

1431
01:15:58,211 --> 01:16:00,379
So I'm gonna bet
heavy on this game.

1432
01:16:01,298 --> 01:16:03,716
- You understand? Heavy.
- Yeah.

1433
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:05,718
I want you to go to the game
with your brother.

1434
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:08,346
You want me to go
to the game with Jake?

1435
01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:10,181
- Of course I do.
- Does he want me to go?

1436
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:12,141
- Of course he wants you to go.
- He told you that?

1437
01:16:12,309 --> 01:16:15,519
- He told me, yes.
- Even with all his friends?

1438
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,147
- With all his friends. He trusts you.
- He's not embarrassed?

1439
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:20,358
No. I'd love to go to the game, too,

1440
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:22,652
but as you know,
I'm banned from the stadium.

1441
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:24,612
'Cause I'd love to see us
beat the Giants

1442
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,572
and take a lot of money
from this asshole.

1443
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,618
Listen, personally,
I think it's a stupid bet.

1444
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:31,953
Randy...

1445
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,746
As a matter of fact,
I think it's ridiculous

1446
01:16:33,914 --> 01:16:36,457
to bet all that dough
for the restaurant on a game.

1447
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,000
Randy...

1448
01:16:38,168 --> 01:16:40,002
I just hope you
heard what I said.

1449
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:44,173
It's like a family business,
it's our family endeavor.

1450
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:46,926
We all stick together on this.
That's how it works.

1451
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:50,763
That's a positive, positive vibe.

1452
01:16:52,683 --> 01:16:54,725
I made a commitment to tiffany
about a project,

1453
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:58,729
and we have a very important part of it
that we have to go over on Sunday, so...

1454
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:02,066
Um...

1455
01:17:03,443 --> 01:17:04,819
And it's good for me, Dad.

1456
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:08,406
It's making me disciplined
and focused and it's...

1457
01:17:08,573 --> 01:17:10,658
...I never would've thought this,
but it's a good thing.

1458
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,077
What is this thing you're doing?

1459
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:16,080
Yeah, what is it?
What is this project, hon?

1460
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:20,042
It's a dance thing, OK?
There's nothing more to it, Dad.

1461
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,461
I swear.

1462
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:35,057
Listen, I need
to ask you something.

1463
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:36,308
Tomorrow can I spend
half the day with you

1464
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:37,852
and half the day
at the Eagles game?

1465
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,688
I'm gonna pretend that you
didn't just ask me that.

1466
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:41,981
Why?

1467
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:45,026
These are the two days
that you have promised me,

1468
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,319
and that we have prepared
to nail the big move.

1469
01:17:47,487 --> 01:17:49,739
It's not ready yet.
We don't have a move yet.

1470
01:17:49,906 --> 01:17:51,198
I know, but my dad
opened up to me,

1471
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,035
and it was really beautiful
and I wanna be of service to him, OK?

1472
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,495
And he's worried that the juju
from the Eagles is being fucked up,

1473
01:17:56,663 --> 01:17:58,330
and he's concerned that it's because
I'm spending time with you.

1474
01:17:58,498 --> 01:18:00,332
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

1475
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,127
No, you're not messing up the juju,
but the juju is messed up

1476
01:18:03,295 --> 01:18:05,046
because I'm not with him
during the games.

1477
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:08,174
- Guess what?
- What?

1478
01:18:08,341 --> 01:18:10,593
nikki replied to your letter.

1479
01:18:14,431 --> 01:18:18,350
But you can't read it
until after you nail the big move.

1480
01:18:18,518 --> 01:18:20,436
Go.

1481
01:18:38,789 --> 01:18:41,415
Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything
else till I can read nikki's letter, OK?

1482
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:44,794
It's in the back of my head.
We don't almost have it, all right?

1483
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:49,924
- I just hope you can handle it.
- Thank you.

1484
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,926
What was her energy
when she gave it to you?

1485
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,806
She was intrigued, excited,
and a little scared.

1486
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:00,684
She was scared? About what?
Did she tell you?

1487
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:07,024
Try to stay positive.

1488
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:14,824
I'm just gonna read it out loud, OK?
Because if she says anything that's...

1489
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:17,868
- Is that too much to ask?
- No.

1490
01:19:24,543 --> 01:19:26,168
I thought you were gonna
read it out loud.

1491
01:19:26,336 --> 01:19:28,671
OK. I'm sorry.

1492
01:19:28,839 --> 01:19:30,714
"Dear Pat:

1493
01:19:32,926 --> 01:19:35,094
It was very emotional
for me to get your letter,

1494
01:19:35,262 --> 01:19:38,097
as I'm sure you can imagine.
But I'm glad you took the risk

1495
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:40,933
of discreetly getting it to me
through tiffany.

1496
01:19:41,601 --> 01:19:43,227
This gives us a chance to communicate

1497
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:46,605
while I keep the restraining order
until I feel safe.

1498
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,069
I must admit you sound terrific
and I'm happy that you are feeling

1499
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:54,989
so positive and becoming
a more loving and caring man,

1500
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,283
which I always knew you were."

1501
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:16,218
"I was moved to read about 'Excelsior'
and your belief in happy endings.

1502
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:18,596
I'm also moved by your act of love
to read the books I have taught

1503
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:21,432
at the high school. I'm sorry you find
them so negative, but I disagree.

1504
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,310
I think they're great works of art
that reflect how hard life can be,

1505
01:20:24,477 --> 01:20:27,771
and they can also help kids prepare
themselves for the hardness of life.

1506
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:30,482
In spite of all these positive
developments, Pat,

1507
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:34,320
I have to say if it's me reading the
signs, I need to see something

1508
01:20:34,487 --> 01:20:37,198
to prove you are ready
to resume our marriage.

1509
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,742
Otherwise I find myself
thinking that we...

1510
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,455
...might both be better off
moving on with our lives separately.

1511
01:20:51,504 --> 01:20:54,715
Please don't react quickly to this,
but take time to think about it.

1512
01:20:56,343 --> 01:20:59,303
I'm glad you're doing so well.
Love, nikki."

1513
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,442
I think I'm done today, OK?

1514
01:21:18,365 --> 01:21:22,952
She said to show her something, Pat.
This dance could be that something.

1515
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:26,372
You would have never done something
like this in a million years.

1516
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:29,083
It shows all kinds of skills
on so many different levels:

1517
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:32,378
focus, collaboration, discipline.

1518
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,465
It's romantic, like I said it would be.

1519
01:21:38,009 --> 01:21:39,551
It's for her.

1520
01:21:41,304 --> 01:21:44,431
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

1521
01:21:57,404 --> 01:21:59,780
- Can I use your phone?
- Is it an emergency?

1522
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:03,033
- Yeah, kind of.
- What kind of emergency?

1523
01:22:03,868 --> 01:22:06,620
Well, I'm just doing this project
with tiffany and I wanted to tell her

1524
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,455
I'm not gonna be on time.

1525
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:11,667
Just don't make her an emergency.
That crazy girl, you know?

1526
01:22:11,835 --> 01:22:14,628
She's... I'll just borrow Jake's phone.

1527
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:16,463
It's too bad you can't
come to the stadium,

1528
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:19,508
but I know you were kicked out,
you know, beating everybody up.

1529
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:23,012
Guess we're not that different,
huh, Dad?

1530
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:27,975
- That a bad thing?
- No, I think it's a good thing.

1531
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,894
Don't drink too much.
Don't hit anybody.

1532
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:34,189
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah, I'm solid.

1533
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:43,324
- Here's my little brother, Pat.
- Hey, how you doing? Pat.

1534
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,327
So, Pat, what's this I hear
about you just getting out?

1535
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,538
- Yeah, from the loony bin!
- Guys, what the fuck?!

1536
01:22:49,706 --> 01:22:51,248
I talked to you about that already.

1537
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,667
- I told you...
- It's all right.

1538
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:56,712
- It's all right.
- He's a good dude! He's a good dude.

1539
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:05,596
Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!
Every week!

1540
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:17,024
No!

1541
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,026
Ah, Jake, you better
get your brother.

1542
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,278
- Cuckoo bird's taking off.
- Cuckoo bird!

1543
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:23,781
Dr. Patel!

1544
01:23:23,948 --> 01:23:26,950
- Pat!
- Hey!

1545
01:23:27,118 --> 01:23:29,828
- What are you doing here?
- We must beat the Giants, my brother.

1546
01:23:29,996 --> 01:23:33,332
I'm not supposed to be seeing
you, right? Outside the office?

1547
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,168
- Isn't that illegal?
- Pat, today I'm your brother in green,

1548
01:23:36,336 --> 01:23:38,587
not your therapist.
I'm so happy to see you.

1549
01:23:38,755 --> 01:23:41,340
- Wonderful that you are here!
- Hey, Jake! This is Cliff.

1550
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:43,425
- This is my doctor, Cliff.
- Look, two things.

1551
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:45,844
We gotta watch that bubble screen
for fucking Manning in the backfield,

1552
01:23:46,012 --> 01:23:48,680
and we gotta make sure we knock
the receivers on their ass

1553
01:23:48,848 --> 01:23:50,474
- off the line of scrimmage.
- You can say that again.

1554
01:23:50,642 --> 01:23:54,061
Those cocksuckers!

1555
01:24:20,547 --> 01:24:22,339
OK, you know what?
I don't have her phone number.

1556
01:24:22,507 --> 01:24:24,800
If you want, if you really want,
you can call veronica...

1557
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:26,135
- I'll call veronica.
- ...'cause she does,

1558
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:27,845
- but I don't want to talk to veronica.
- Why don't you wanna...?

1559
01:24:28,012 --> 01:24:30,431
Because she brings me down!
She just brings me down.

1560
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:31,932
You're not gonna
throw the marriage away!

1561
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,268
There's some kind of love there.
I know, I used to see it.

1562
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,895
You guys have a beautiful thing that
got broken somewhere along the line,

1563
01:24:37,063 --> 01:24:38,647
and you gotta fix it
like a chiropractor.

1564
01:24:38,815 --> 01:24:40,607
You gotta give it
a chiropractic adjustment.

1565
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,734
- Enough with awkwardness!
- You're right.

1566
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:45,696
I don't wanna walk in your house and
not be able to say what I wanna say.

1567
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:47,489
You're right, you're right, man.

1568
01:24:47,657 --> 01:24:51,994
Whoo! Eagles, baby!
Yeah! Let's go! Whoo!

1569
01:24:52,162 --> 01:24:55,038
What the fuck? What's that smell?

1570
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:58,917
Nasty Indian curry!
This is America, baby!

1571
01:24:59,085 --> 01:25:00,461
Go back to your country!

1572
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:02,504
What, what's wrong?

1573
01:25:02,672 --> 01:25:04,590
Hey!

1574
01:25:05,842 --> 01:25:08,177
- Whoa, what's going on?
- Stay back, Pat. Stay back!

1575
01:25:09,762 --> 01:25:11,472
Leave the fucking Indians
alone, tough guy!

1576
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,682
- You're a traitor to your people!
- Stay here, stay here.

1577
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,309
I'm not gonna do anything.

1578
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,269
They're fuckin' great!
They're cool!

1579
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:19,271
I'm not gonna fight.
I'm not gonna fight.

1580
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:22,983
- Let's just calm down!
- We're the real Eagles fans!

1581
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,819
- Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, get him, get him!

1582
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,529
Get off my fuckin' brother!

1583
01:25:27,697 --> 01:25:29,281
Break it
up or you'll be arrested!

1584
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,579
Hey, hey, hey!

1585
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:55,307
What'd you do?
What happened?

1586
01:25:55,475 --> 01:25:57,309
- Dad. Dad...
- What the fuck happened?

1587
01:25:57,477 --> 01:26:00,687
The Birds lose, I lose a fucking
fortune, a fortune to Randy!

1588
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,481
What the fuck did you do?!

1589
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:04,983
You fucking lost it.
I thought you said you had it together!

1590
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:06,818
- You were solid!
- I am solid.

1591
01:26:06,986 --> 01:26:09,279
I was solid at the game, Dad.
I'm solid, I'm solid now.

1592
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:11,156
You fell apart! What are you
fucking talking about?!

1593
01:26:11,324 --> 01:26:13,200
Your son was trying to...

1594
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,327
It's all fucking ruined now.
It's all ruined.

1595
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:18,956
It's all fucking ruined now!
It's all fucking ruined!

1596
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:21,124
It's all ruined,
you little fucking shit!

1597
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:23,168
I didn't do a fucking thing!

1598
01:26:23,336 --> 01:26:25,462
- Come on, Dad!
- You loser! You loser!

1599
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,339
I'm not a loser.

1600
01:26:27,507 --> 01:26:30,342
You fucking loser! Ruined it!
Spiked the ball at the one-yard line!

1601
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:32,261
He was defending his brother!

1602
01:26:32,428 --> 01:26:34,346
Spike the fucking ball
at the one-yard line!

1603
01:26:34,514 --> 01:26:35,430
You fuckin' idiot!

1604
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:40,185
- Who is this?
- We need to talk right now!

1605
01:26:40,353 --> 01:26:41,937
When you make a serious
commitment to somebody,

1606
01:26:42,105 --> 01:26:43,897
it is not cool to not show up!

1607
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,566
Wait a second, I tried to call...

1608
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,025
- Oh, my God. What's happening?
- Who is this?

1609
01:26:47,193 --> 01:26:48,318
- Who is this?
- I tried to call you, tiffany.

1610
01:26:48,486 --> 01:26:50,028
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1611
01:26:50,196 --> 01:26:52,239
I told you I was gonna split my
time with my dad and you,

1612
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:53,865
and my dad was pulling me
in one direction.

1613
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:55,867
- Dr. Patel, Ronnie...
- Well, that sounds great, Pat.

1614
01:26:56,035 --> 01:26:58,161
That's great for all of them,

1615
01:26:58,329 --> 01:27:02,416
but all of them didn't make a commitment
to me in return for my help.

1616
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,794
I'm tiffany, by the way.

1617
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,090
What is this craziness
with tiffany Maxwell?

1618
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:12,134
There's no craziness.
I told you who she was.

1619
01:27:12,302 --> 01:27:14,177
I was doing this thing with her.
We had a conversation!

1620
01:27:14,345 --> 01:27:16,638
When you started spending
time with her, it all fell apart.

1621
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:18,432
This is the fucking
reason right here.

1622
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,642
You think I fucked up
all the Eagles juju, don't you?

1623
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,604
Ever since he was with you,
ever since...

1624
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,106
You think that
I'm why today has happened?

1625
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,608
That's right,
you are why today has happened.

1626
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,109
I'm the reason why today happened?

1627
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:30,694
- I think so.
- Let's talk about that.

1628
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:32,362
Be my guest.

1629
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:34,489
The first night that
Pat and I met at my sister's,

1630
01:27:34,657 --> 01:27:37,993
the Eagles beat
the 49ers handily, 40-26.

1631
01:27:38,161 --> 01:27:39,995
The second time we got together,
we went for a run

1632
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:43,373
and the Phillies beat
the Dodgers 7-5 in the NLCS.

1633
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,792
- She's right, Dad.
- The next time we went for a run,

1634
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,755
- the Eagles beat the Falcons, 27-14.
- Wow.

1635
01:27:49,922 --> 01:27:53,258
The third time we got together
we had Raisin Bran in the diner,

1636
01:27:53,426 --> 01:27:55,218
and the Phillies
dominated Tampa Bay

1637
01:27:55,386 --> 01:27:57,346
in the fourth game
of the World Series, 10-2.

1638
01:27:57,513 --> 01:27:59,097
- Oh, wow.
- Fascinating.

1639
01:27:59,265 --> 01:28:01,183
Let me think about that.
Wait a minute.

1640
01:28:01,351 --> 01:28:04,436
Well, why don't you think about when
the Eagles beat the Seahawks, 14-7.

1641
01:28:04,604 --> 01:28:07,356
- He was with you?
- He was with me. We went for a run.

1642
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:09,524
- That's crazy.
- There have been no games

1643
01:28:09,692 --> 01:28:11,610
since Pat and I have been
rehearsing every day,

1644
01:28:11,778 --> 01:28:14,780
and if Pat had been with me
like he was supposed to,

1645
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:16,990
he wouldn't have gotten
in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble,

1646
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,493
maybe the Eagles
beat the New York Giants.

1647
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:24,247
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.

1648
01:28:26,084 --> 01:28:28,293
Does anybody here happen
to know what the official

1649
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:30,545
motto of the state of New York
is on the official seal

1650
01:28:30,713 --> 01:28:33,965
of the State of New York?
Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know?

1651
01:28:34,133 --> 01:28:35,342
- No.
- "Excelsior."

1652
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,927
- Oh!
- Look it up.

1653
01:28:37,095 --> 01:28:39,846
- Really?
- Yeah, "Excelsior."

1654
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:43,558
- Oh, Pat.
- Not that I give a fuck about football

1655
01:28:43,726 --> 01:28:46,353
or about your superstitions,
but if it's me reading the signs,

1656
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:50,482
I don't send the Eagles guy
whose personal motto is "Excelsior"

1657
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,694
to a fucking Giants game,
especially when he's

1658
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:56,238
- already in a legal situation.
- Unbelievable.

1659
01:28:56,406 --> 01:28:57,656
- She's unbelievable.
- Wow.

1660
01:28:57,824 --> 01:28:59,074
How did you know
all that stuff?

1661
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:01,827
I did my research.

1662
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,957
- Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

1663
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,167
Yeah. I gotta rethink this whole thing.

1664
01:29:11,254 --> 01:29:14,381
I didn't trust her before,
but I gotta say, now I do.

1665
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:15,799
Oh, now you like her, Dad?

1666
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,219
I have to say I do. Yup.

1667
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,723
Patrizio...
I feel terrible, you know?

1668
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,517
You made the bet,
I won a lot of money,

1669
01:29:25,685 --> 01:29:27,936
and now, look,
your whole family is in turmoil.

1670
01:29:28,104 --> 01:29:30,564
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.

1671
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:33,817
You live for this shit. You've been
betting against my father for years.

1672
01:29:33,985 --> 01:29:36,737
You're twisting the knife
right now. You get off on it!

1673
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,697
- That's not true! Don't say that!
- You get off on it!

1674
01:29:38,865 --> 01:29:41,658
- Fine, then prove it. Prove it.
- Yeah, prove it!

1675
01:29:41,826 --> 01:29:43,201
How do you want me to prove it?

1676
01:29:43,369 --> 01:29:45,579
- How do we prove it?
- How do I prove it?

1677
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,540
By giving them the chance to win back
everything, double or nothing.

1678
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:49,958
No, no, no.

1679
01:29:50,126 --> 01:29:52,127
Double or nothing
on the Bengals, next week?

1680
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:53,336
Is that what you're saying?

1681
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:56,673
Mm-mm.

1682
01:29:59,469 --> 01:30:03,430
- Against the Cowboys.
- Oh, come on, are you kidding?

1683
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,765
That's his team!

1684
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,641
That's your team,
isn't it, Randy?

1685
01:30:06,809 --> 01:30:08,685
I know who his team is.

1686
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:09,895
When is the game?

1687
01:30:10,062 --> 01:30:12,731
December 28th,
last game of the season.

1688
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:16,902
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs
Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

1689
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:18,528
- Oh, God.
- Randy...

1690
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:21,156
I thought they were America's Team.
Don't you believe in America's Team?

1691
01:30:21,324 --> 01:30:23,742
Yeah, Randy, don't you
believe in America's Team?

1692
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:26,912
Yeah, I believe in America's
Team, but if I win that bet,

1693
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:32,334
I win your book, you're out of action,
you get no restaurant, no nothing.

1694
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:34,044
I like it.

1695
01:30:34,212 --> 01:30:36,880
- No. No, Patrizio...
- I believe in the Eagles,

1696
01:30:37,048 --> 01:30:39,257
I believe in my son,
I'll take the action. I'll take it.

1697
01:30:39,425 --> 01:30:42,052
- Dad.
- Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

1698
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,888
I have faith. I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house...

1699
01:30:45,056 --> 01:30:46,264
- Dad.
- That's right.

1700
01:30:46,432 --> 01:30:47,891
Not in the state
of New York, in this house.

1701
01:30:48,059 --> 01:30:50,727
Dad, I didn't know that "Excelsior"
was the state motto of New York.

1702
01:30:50,895 --> 01:30:53,396
- I didn't know, either, but now I know.
- But listen, this is toxic.

1703
01:30:53,564 --> 01:30:55,816
Dad, this is toxic,
you shouldn't be doing this...

1704
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,859
Be quiet, shut up.
You already did enough.

1705
01:30:58,027 --> 01:31:01,029
Randy, what do you say?
My Birds, Benjamin Franklin's team,

1706
01:31:01,197 --> 01:31:03,490
favored by one and a half points.
I'll give you three more.

1707
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,952
Patrizio, stop it!
And, Randy, don't you take the bet!

1708
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:11,373
- In fact, I'll give you ten points.
- No, Dad! Dad!

1709
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,375
- Dad!
- This is insanity!

1710
01:31:13,543 --> 01:31:17,045
You have to take that bet
on the Cowboys.

1711
01:31:17,213 --> 01:31:18,713
Jesus!

1712
01:31:18,881 --> 01:31:20,340
How could you
not take that bet?

1713
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:21,883
Even with the
ten points I give you

1714
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:23,635
that's an insane spread
to your advantage.

1715
01:31:23,803 --> 01:31:25,512
Cowboys are cowards.

1716
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,515
And I'll bet you're such a coward,
you won't take the ten.

1717
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:32,018
Plus, are you listening, plus whatever
their score is at the dance thing.

1718
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:34,062
- What's that? tiffany, what's that?
- What? No, no, no.

1719
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:36,273
You're crazy to give away
that many points.

1720
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,568
That's ridiculous! I won't take that!
However, wait a second.

1721
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:47,701
- I do like the idea of a parlay.
- What? No parlay! No!

1722
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:50,620
- No, don't do it. Don't do it.
- Oh, mother of God.

1723
01:31:50,788 --> 01:31:52,998
Pat, how do they run
this dance competition?

1724
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:54,749
I mean, how do they score it
and everything?

1725
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:56,585
I don't know, I don't know how
they fucking score...

1726
01:31:56,752 --> 01:31:58,628
We're participating.
We're not a part of it.

1727
01:31:58,796 --> 01:32:01,673
There's the people... this is a high-end
dance contest. I don't know.

1728
01:32:01,841 --> 01:32:04,050
Do not put it as
part of the parlay, Randy.

1729
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:05,760
They go by
the Philadelphia rules.

1730
01:32:05,928 --> 01:32:07,846
Each dancer is scored
on a scale of one to ten,

1731
01:32:08,014 --> 01:32:10,307
ten being the highest. You have to
average the four judges' scores.

1732
01:32:10,474 --> 01:32:14,603
OK, scores one to ten, right?
And you guys are how good?

1733
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:16,605
- We suck.
- We don't suck.

1734
01:32:16,772 --> 01:32:19,983
Pat's a beginner, I'm OK, we're
happy just to be going there.

1735
01:32:20,151 --> 01:32:22,068
And how are the people
you're competing against?

1736
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:24,154
They're good.
Some of them are professionals.

1737
01:32:24,322 --> 01:32:26,197
Better than you?

1738
01:32:26,365 --> 01:32:28,283
- A lot better.
- A lot better.

1739
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:31,494
So, if I was to say
you only have to score five,

1740
01:32:31,662 --> 01:32:33,538
I would be really
very generous, right?

1741
01:32:33,706 --> 01:32:35,832
No, no, that would be amazing
if we got five.

1742
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,544
Oh, come on, we can get a five
out of ten! Gimme a break!

1743
01:32:39,712 --> 01:32:42,839
- Gimme me a break!
- Give 'em a five. Give 'em a five.

1744
01:32:43,007 --> 01:32:44,716
- We can do a five.
- What are you talking about?

1745
01:32:44,884 --> 01:32:46,593
- That's the parlay!
- Will somebody please

1746
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,303
explain me the parlay? Please?

1747
01:32:48,471 --> 01:32:50,639
You gotta win two bets
or you lose the whole thing.

1748
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:54,309
For Pat Sr. to win, the Birds
gotta beat the Cowboys, plus,

1749
01:32:54,477 --> 01:32:57,729
Pat and tiffany gotta get
at least a five at the dance.

1750
01:32:57,897 --> 01:32:59,648
That's very, very manic indeed.

1751
01:32:59,815 --> 01:33:00,815
That's the parlay.

1752
01:33:00,983 --> 01:33:03,151
- Shake on it.
- No!

1753
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:04,611
- It's a bet!
- No!

1754
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,488
You know what?
I'm not gonna be a part of this.

1755
01:33:06,656 --> 01:33:07,864
Randy, you're a sickness.

1756
01:33:08,032 --> 01:33:09,532
You're a fucking sickness,
Randy. I'm out.

1757
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,619
- Pat, you can't quit.
- I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

1758
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:15,080
- Pat, calm down. Think about...
- See you later.

1759
01:33:15,247 --> 01:33:17,290
Pat, no.

1760
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,667
- What are you doing?
- Pat.

1761
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:20,502
- I'm out.
- What?

1762
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,212
Here we are again
at the one-yard line.

1763
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:24,756
- I'm not happy. I am not happy.
- DeSean, snatching defeat

1764
01:33:24,924 --> 01:33:26,257
from the jaws of victory.

1765
01:33:26,425 --> 01:33:28,051
- There you go.
- What does that even mean, Dad?

1766
01:33:28,219 --> 01:33:30,011
I'm not gonna make that
connection that you're making

1767
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:31,763
with DeSean Jackson.
It doesn't matter anymore, OK?

1768
01:33:31,931 --> 01:33:33,765
Just because I have
the fucking jersey on.

1769
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:35,183
I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

1770
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:37,394
You are not a stand-up
guy right now.

1771
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:40,313
- If it's me reading the signs...
- You reading the signs?

1772
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,232
You're reading the signs? OK.

1773
01:33:44,402 --> 01:33:48,071
- Pat!
- You are not a stand-up guy!

1774
01:33:55,121 --> 01:33:57,455
I told you not to push it.

1775
01:33:57,623 --> 01:33:59,207
Yeah, but he's
gotta do this thing.

1776
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:02,085
He can't be a quitter.
He cannot be a quitter.

1777
01:34:02,253 --> 01:34:05,964
You took that stupid parlay thing,
and now he won't do the dance,

1778
01:34:06,132 --> 01:34:08,508
and it was very constructive
for him and you ruined it.

1779
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,593
There's only one way
to get him to show.

1780
01:34:10,761 --> 01:34:12,679
- What's that?
- What's that?

1781
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:15,890
We have to tell him
nikki's gonna be there.

1782
01:34:22,773 --> 01:34:26,192
Signs. Reading signs...

1783
01:34:30,573 --> 01:34:31,781
She won't come. She can't come.

1784
01:34:31,949 --> 01:34:33,116
We have to tell him
that she's coming.

1785
01:34:33,284 --> 01:34:34,784
We have to tell him
that she's going.

1786
01:34:34,952 --> 01:34:36,619
- But that's a lie!
- It's a white lie.

1787
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,038
It's a white lie,
what's that matter?

1788
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:39,998
That's no big deal.
So it's a little lie.

1789
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,624
No other way.

1790
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:43,918
You know, we gotta leave
a trail of bread crumbs

1791
01:34:44,086 --> 01:34:47,672
so that he can live
his life without ruining it.

1792
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,760
No. I don't approve.
You can't do it.

1793
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:54,220
Well, you know, I didn't approve
when you called her,

1794
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:57,432
and you told her where he was running,
so she could ambush him.

1795
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,102
I didn't approve of that, but you
did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway.

1796
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,771
That's it.

1797
01:35:02,938 --> 01:35:05,982
We're gonna tell him
nikki will be there.

1798
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:11,905
You gotta be part of it.

1799
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,656
We have to do it.

1800
01:35:13,824 --> 01:35:17,160
Aren't you
nervous to be lying?

1801
01:35:17,328 --> 01:35:18,328
Ah...

1802
01:35:19,121 --> 01:35:22,665
A little bit.
But it's for the best.

1803
01:35:27,546 --> 01:35:29,881
"...but if it was me
reading the signs..."

1804
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:32,884
I...

1805
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:03,790
That's it.

1806
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:05,542
OK.

1807
01:36:30,734 --> 01:36:32,402
Hey.

1808
01:36:36,448 --> 01:36:38,366
Hey, what's up?

1809
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:43,830
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's fine.

1810
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:18,948
Cheers.

1811
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:20,992
Cheers.

1812
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,547
This isn't working!

1813
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:11,542
Come on, it's gonna be great.

1814
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:14,671
nikki's gonna be there.
You know?

1815
01:38:14,838 --> 01:38:17,882
Everything's gonna come together.
It's what's meant to be.

1816
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,550
You OK?

1817
01:38:21,178 --> 01:38:24,180
- Well, don't get wobbly on me.
- I'm not.

1818
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,933
OK, we have a dance to do.
We have a parlay.

1819
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:29,102
- You gotta stay focused.
- I'm focused.

1820
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:30,812
Good, let's go.

1821
01:38:48,247 --> 01:38:51,833
- Look at the dancers. You see them?
- Shit.

1822
01:38:55,921 --> 01:38:58,673
Randy, Jake.
What do we got?

1823
01:38:58,841 --> 01:39:01,259
Dallas just tied it
with a field goal, 3-3.

1824
01:39:01,427 --> 01:39:03,511
- I'm worried about the bet.
- Don't worry about the bet.

1825
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,889
- I'm worried about the bet.
- Holy shit.

1826
01:39:09,685 --> 01:39:13,354
- Is this Dancing with the Stars?
- Well, you knew that.

1827
01:39:13,522 --> 01:39:15,064
Maybe you should've scouted them.

1828
01:39:15,232 --> 01:39:17,483
Look at those fucking dancers!

1829
01:39:20,404 --> 01:39:22,322
You can give me
the money now, you know?

1830
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:26,492
Patty, Patty, all we have to do
is we have to make a five.

1831
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,619
That's all. You stay here
and watch the game with me.

1832
01:39:28,787 --> 01:39:31,456
The Birds are better when Pat
is with me. We settled that.

1833
01:39:31,623 --> 01:39:34,417
- Stay for the next quarter.
- Relax, we're gonna be fine, OK?

1834
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:36,210
I'll see you in a little bit.
I'll see you up there, OK?

1835
01:39:36,378 --> 01:39:38,838
- Hey, Pat, tiffany!
- Hey!

1836
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:40,715
What a glorious,
beautiful occasion, man.

1837
01:39:40,883 --> 01:39:42,967
Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy,
I'll see you. Take care.

1838
01:39:43,135 --> 01:39:44,344
All right. Wish me luck.

1839
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:45,887
Excelsior!

1840
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:49,057
What's this?

1841
01:39:49,224 --> 01:39:51,559
- What? I thought you were doing it.
- I thought you were doing it.

1842
01:39:51,727 --> 01:39:53,936
We're doing a dance thing
anyway, for God's sake.

1843
01:39:58,525 --> 01:39:59,817
You OK?

1844
01:40:01,987 --> 01:40:04,113
I want you to remember everything.
I want you to remember

1845
01:40:04,281 --> 01:40:06,157
all of the good stuff
that we have here.

1846
01:40:06,325 --> 01:40:07,992
- Of course I do.
- Just check in.

1847
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,911
I gotta go find veronica.

1848
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:11,996
- Hi, good evening.
- Good evening.

1849
01:40:12,164 --> 01:40:13,998
- Check in.
- Please.

1850
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:15,958
How many dancers are there?

1851
01:40:18,754 --> 01:40:21,422
What? nikki?

1852
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:27,762
nikki. Oh, Jesus.

1853
01:40:42,861 --> 01:40:44,904
What the fuck?

1854
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:49,700
- Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
- You're killing me.

1855
01:40:49,868 --> 01:40:51,744
- You're killing me!
- tiffany, please.

1856
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:55,039
She'll see how well he's doing,
maybe she'll lift the restraining order.

1857
01:40:55,207 --> 01:40:57,750
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Pat told me.

1858
01:40:57,918 --> 01:41:01,754
He told me you should never
throw a marriage out the window.

1859
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:03,214
He did not say that.

1860
01:41:03,382 --> 01:41:04,382
- Yes.
- He didn't say that.

1861
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,217
He said it several times, tiffany,

1862
01:41:06,385 --> 01:41:08,344
and it's his chance.
You gotta give him a chance.

1863
01:41:39,334 --> 01:41:43,337
Bartender! Bartender,
can I get a vodka, please?

1864
01:42:07,738 --> 01:42:10,865
- So, you want another one?
- Sure.

1865
01:43:20,394 --> 01:43:22,395
So what do you do?

1866
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:25,898
I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.

1867
01:43:26,066 --> 01:43:27,483
Oh.

1868
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:30,903
The arguing guy.

1869
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:34,574
7.6, 7.3,

1870
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:38,786
7.4 and 6.9,

1871
01:43:38,954 --> 01:43:42,456
for an average score of 7.3.

1872
01:43:42,624 --> 01:43:46,210
- Three, two, one!
- Holy shit!

1873
01:43:46,378 --> 01:43:51,215
Philadelphia beats Dallas!
They are on their way to the playoffs!

1874
01:44:00,309 --> 01:44:03,561
- Where's tiffany?
- I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?

1875
01:44:03,729 --> 01:44:06,272
- You gotta find her.
- I know, Mom, I know.

1876
01:44:31,882 --> 01:44:34,800
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
- She's fine, buddy, she's with me.

1877
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:35,968
- She's fine?
- Yeah.

1878
01:44:36,136 --> 01:44:37,678
Why don't you shut up, OK?

1879
01:44:37,846 --> 01:44:40,389
- How many drinks have you had?
- I've had two vodkas.

1880
01:44:40,557 --> 01:44:42,975
I don't know what choices you've made,
but you gotta deal with it right now.

1881
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:44,518
OK? We're in this.

1882
01:44:44,686 --> 01:44:47,021
- We're in what?
- Next...

1883
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:50,608
- ...Pat Solatano and tiffany Maxwell.
- You know, I used to think

1884
01:44:50,776 --> 01:44:52,443
that you were the best thing
that ever happened to me,

1885
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:55,404
but now I think that you
might maybe be the worst thing,

1886
01:44:55,572 --> 01:44:57,156
and I'm sorry
that I ever met you.

1887
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:59,784
Good for you.
Come on, let's dance.

1888
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:04,372
And the scores are:

1889
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:08,042
6.7, 8.1...

1890
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:11,045
...7.5 and 6.5,

1891
01:45:11,213 --> 01:45:14,215
for an average score of 7.2.

1892
01:45:19,763 --> 01:45:21,764
They were great!

1893
01:45:21,932 --> 01:45:24,767
And they only got a 7.2!
This is a tough room.

1894
01:45:24,935 --> 01:45:27,645
Got it.

1895
01:45:28,146 --> 01:45:30,606
Up next, ladies and gentlemen,

1896
01:45:30,774 --> 01:45:36,237
please welcome Pat Solatano,
Jr. and tiffany Maxwell.

1897
01:45:39,491 --> 01:45:40,491
Come on, Pat!

1898
01:45:43,829 --> 01:45:44,954
Damn.

1899
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:55,756
- Let's go, Patty!
- Come on, Pat!

1900
01:48:52,976 --> 01:48:55,019
Yeah, Pat! Yeah!

1901
01:48:56,146 --> 01:48:58,147
We love you, Pat!

1902
01:49:05,822 --> 01:49:09,074
All right, let's see
the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.

1903
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:11,410
We have a 4.9...

1904
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:13,370
...4.8...

1905
01:49:14,831 --> 01:49:16,916
...a 4.9...

1906
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:19,710
That's really too bad, guys.
That's a lot of fours.

1907
01:49:19,878 --> 01:49:25,049
...and a 5.4...
for an average score of...

1908
01:49:25,216 --> 01:49:27,259
- ...5.0.
- Sorry.

1909
01:49:27,427 --> 01:49:28,636
Sorry about that, guys.

1910
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,140
What?! Come on!

1911
01:49:36,394 --> 01:49:37,811
Dad, Dad,
did the Eagles win?

1912
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:43,525
- The Eagles won, 44-6! They won, 44-6!
- Come on!

1913
01:49:43,693 --> 01:49:45,527
We'll take
a ten-minute break.

1914
01:49:45,695 --> 01:49:47,738
Why are they so
excited about a five?

1915
01:49:47,906 --> 01:49:49,448
Great, great job!

1916
01:49:56,289 --> 01:49:58,123
Thank you! You're amazing!

1917
01:50:21,815 --> 01:50:23,899
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

1918
01:50:24,067 --> 01:50:26,610
- How are you? You OK?
- I'm good. How are you?

1919
01:50:26,778 --> 01:50:28,612
I'm really good.
Yeah, thanks.

1920
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:30,572
- You looked really happy out there.
- Did I?

1921
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:32,574
Yeah, yeah.
Who'd have thought, dancing?

1922
01:50:36,955 --> 01:50:39,540
- You look incredible.
- Thank you, yeah.

1923
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:41,208
You lost a lot of weight.

1924
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:43,502
I've been reading your books, and...

1925
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:47,256
...I have a positive attitude.
I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.

1926
01:51:48,568 --> 01:51:50,235
- Where's tiffany?
- She left.

1927
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:52,237
- What do you mean, she left?
- She left.

1928
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:54,114
- What do you expect?
- Where is she?

1929
01:51:54,282 --> 01:51:56,492
Let me tell ya, I know you don't
wanna listen to your father,

1930
01:51:56,659 --> 01:51:58,577
I didn't listen to mine.
And I'm telling you,

1931
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,370
you gotta pay attention to the signs.

1932
01:52:00,538 --> 01:52:02,289
When life reaches out
with a moment like this,

1933
01:52:02,457 --> 01:52:03,582
it's a sin if you don't reach back.

1934
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:06,418
I'm telling you,
it's a sin if you don't reach back

1935
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:08,545
and it'll haunt you the rest
of your days like a curse.

1936
01:52:08,713 --> 01:52:10,839
You're facing a big challenge
in your life right now,

1937
01:52:11,007 --> 01:52:12,466
this very moment, right here.

1938
01:52:12,634 --> 01:52:14,218
That girl loves you,
she really loves you.

1939
01:52:14,385 --> 01:52:15,427
And I don't know if nikki ever did,

1940
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:16,970
but she sure as hell
doesn't love you right now.

1941
01:52:17,138 --> 01:52:19,890
I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

1942
01:52:21,851 --> 01:52:23,602
I love you, Dad.

1943
01:52:38,243 --> 01:52:39,910
Hey!

1944
01:52:55,802 --> 01:52:58,637
- Would you just leave me alone? Please!
- Wait a second!

1945
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:00,139
I have one more letter
for you to read, OK?

1946
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:02,641
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Give it to her yourself!

1947
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:04,643
Let me say something.
You don't ever have to see me again

1948
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:06,186
if you just read it, all right?

1949
01:53:06,354 --> 01:53:09,982
- This is so fucked up.
- Yeah, just read it.

1950
01:53:11,442 --> 01:53:12,568
"Dear tiffany...

1951
01:53:17,282 --> 01:53:19,575
I know you wrote the letter.

1952
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:28,125
The only way you
could meet my..."

1953
01:53:28,293 --> 01:53:31,336
"...crazy was by doing
something crazy yourself.

1954
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:35,299
Thank you. I love you.

1955
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:41,722
I knew it the minute I met you.

1956
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:45,058
I'm sorry it took so long
for me to catch up.

1957
01:53:45,226 --> 01:53:49,271
I just got stuck. Pat."

1958
01:53:52,025 --> 01:53:54,484
I wrote that a week ago.

1959
01:53:54,652 --> 01:53:57,905
- You wrote that a week ago?
- Yes, I did.

1960
01:53:58,072 --> 01:54:00,699
You let me lie to you
for a week?

1961
01:54:00,867 --> 01:54:03,285
I was trying to be romantic.

1962
01:54:05,163 --> 01:54:08,457
- You love me?
- Yeah, I do.

1963
01:54:14,464 --> 01:54:16,048
OK.

1964
01:54:50,667 --> 01:54:54,878
The world will break your heart
ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.

1965
01:54:55,046 --> 01:54:57,089
And I can't begin to explain that.

1966
01:54:57,257 --> 01:55:00,968
Or the craziness inside myself
and everybody else, but guess what?

1967
01:55:01,135 --> 01:55:04,888
Sunday is my favorite day again.

1968
01:55:05,056 --> 01:55:08,183
I think of everything
everyone did for me,

1969
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:11,144
and I feel like a very lucky guy.

1970
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:14,439
We have to beat
the Vikings by three.

1971
01:55:14,607 --> 01:55:17,192
I'm giving you a six,
which is very generous

1972
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,027
after the beating you just took.

1973
01:55:19,195 --> 01:55:21,154
So what are we doing,
what are we talking about here?

1974
01:55:21,322 --> 01:55:24,199
I'd like to do another parlay if we
make it to the next round, that's all.

1975
01:55:24,367 --> 01:55:26,493
But we are gonna make it
to the next round.

1976
01:55:26,661 --> 01:55:28,870
- Did you... I laid that down.
- No, I think I did.

1977
01:55:29,038 --> 01:55:30,789
- No, that was me.
- No, that was me. I played Jack.

1978
01:55:30,957 --> 01:55:32,416
- No, I played the Jack.
- Did you play it?

1979
01:55:32,583 --> 01:55:34,209
So you put the bread crumbs,
the garlic

1980
01:55:34,377 --> 01:55:36,086
in the steak, and you roll it
up with the toothpicks?

1981
01:55:36,254 --> 01:55:39,840
Yeah. For, oh...
maybe three hours, plus.

1982
01:55:40,008 --> 01:55:41,883
Everything's good,
everything's good, yeah.

1983
01:55:42,051 --> 01:55:45,220
I got you, you're all down.
No, Randy, he's complaining.

1984
01:55:45,388 --> 01:55:48,307
You know, he lost a lot of money.
He's moaning and groaning.

1985
01:55:48,474 --> 01:55:50,559
The restaurant's happening
because of Randy, so...

1986
01:55:50,727 --> 01:55:52,394
...everything's good.
