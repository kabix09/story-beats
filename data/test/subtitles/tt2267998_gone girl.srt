pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

Guys, come on. You know better.

1209
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,490
Get off the grass, get
down to the curb.

1210
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,946
- Hey, Gil...
- <font color="#804040">GILPIN</font>: On it.

1211
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,026
All right.

1212
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,945
All right, y'all heard her.
No pictures.

Hello?

00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,415
Hello?

1215
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,490
Fuck.

1216
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,909
You scared me. Want a drink?

1217
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,453
Did you know she was pregnant?

1218
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,621
I told you, Noelle Hawthorne
is fucking crazy.

1219
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,835
She doesn't even know Amy.

1220
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,098
They look like pretty
good friends to me.

<font color="#808080">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,392
Look, I don't know.

1223
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,969
But it certainly doesn't
prove that she's pregnant.

1224
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,227
We have her medical
records coming.

1225
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,139
Good. So, let's
talk while we wait.

1226
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,399
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1227
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,310
You see, we've seen
dozens of home invasions.

1228
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,320
Dozens and dozens.

1229
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,573
This area right here, it looked
wrong from the second we saw it.

1230
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,905
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1231
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,245
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1232
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,284
I don't know. What do
you want me to say?

1233
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,040
Did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing?

1234
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,248
No. Because our guys
did a luminol test.

1235
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,963
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1236
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,253
Amy lost a lot of blood
in there, Nick. A lot.

1237
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,336
Oh, my God.

1238
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,637
Yeah, and then
somebody mopped it up.

1239
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,140
Oh... Wait a second. Why would
they mop up the blood...

1240
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,898
if they're trying to
stage a crime scene?

1241
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,553
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1242
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,018
It tells us, look at
people outside the house.

1243
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,477
Like these homeless
you keep mentioning.

1244
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,610
A pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide.

1245
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,645
It tells us to look at
people inside the house.

1246
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,314
Which is what we're
doing here, Nick.

1247
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,398
I see.

1248
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,192
<font color="#804040">BONEY</font>: So, how was
your marriage, Nick?

1249
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,401
Because right now, all
we got is Noelle.

1250
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,990
She says, "Not good."

1251
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,530
Gil, what do you and
your wife argue about?

1252
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,698
What pisses you off? Oh,
money, lack thereof.

1253
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,492
<font color="#804040">BONEY</font>: Me and my
ex, it's the same.

1254
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,878
I mention that because we got a
look at your finances, Nick.

1255
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,631
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1256
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,632
What? I pulled up some
of the merchandise.

1257
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,668
There are these fun
little splurges.

1258
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,275
<font color="#804040">NICK</font>: I didn't buy
any of this stuff.

1260
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:10,805
I do!
You bought great clubs.

1261

I like the robot dog.

1262

This is a felony!

1263

We need to find
out who did this!

1264
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,982
All right. Let's talk
about life insurance.

1265
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,518
Because in April, you bumped
up Amy's life insurance...

1266
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,640
to $1.2 million.

1267
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,977
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1268
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,190
You filed the paperwork.

1269
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,729
Because she told me to!

I had no idea she was pregnant.

The truth is, Amy
didn't want kids.

Well, I'm as surprised as...

didn't want kids.

Especially when you factor in

Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

You have to fucking talk to me!

1298
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,915
I didn't tell you that
she didn't want kids...

1299
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,492
because she didn't want me to.

1300
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,659
Because it would
have just been...

1301
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,743
another reason for
you to hate her.

1302
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,662

It was easier to just...

I wanted kids!

1304

When we first moved here, I
went to a fertility clinic!

1307
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,755
for Amy to do her thing, all
of a sudden it was like...

1308
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,398
"Well, I don't know. Maybe.
No, thanks."

from the clinic...

01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,616
notifying me that they're
gonna destroy my sample...

So, I gave it to Amy.

1316
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,492
The next day, I saw
it in the trash.

1317

But you were already with
Andie by then, right?

I wanted a baby with Amy.

A year ago, Amy
being pregnant...

1320

would have been the
best thing ever!

couldn't solve.

A letter from Desi.

That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1326
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,755
It was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her.

1327
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,736
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1328

You married a

The morning of our
anniversary...

1534
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,875
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

I couldn't fake it for
another year, another day.

Then what happened?

1537
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,758
Before I could say
anything, she said...

1538
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,087
"I need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage."

1539
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,379
She knew I would go
to Sawyer Beach.

1540
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,718
So you'd have no alibi.

1541
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,100
She stage-managed me.

1542
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,934
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1543
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,518
I went to the beach, I
thought about our marriage.

1544
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,361
I came back and decided
I wanted a divorce.

1545
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,632
And by the time you got home...

1546
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,231
She was gone.

01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,261
Eight years ago...

1661
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,544
she pressed charges against him.

1662
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,853
That should be easy to find.

1663
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,646
Um, ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1664
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,692
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1665
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,234
You go talk to Tommy, and
I'll draw up the contract.

1666
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,534
I told you, you came
to the right guy.

1667
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,960
Apparently.

1668
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,676
Tommy?

1669
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,386
Yeah.

1670
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,767
Thanks for seeing me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1671
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,560

1672
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,315

1674

No, dude, she said I raped her.

1675
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,691
First degree, felony rape.

1676
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,115
Did you do it?
Did you do it?

1677
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,240
Yeah.

1678
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,413
I was looking at
30 years to life.

1679
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,369
Did you get a trial?
Fuck, no.

1680
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,626
Do I look like I would
do well in the yard?

1681
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,708
I pled down, man. Sexual
assault one, no jail time.

1682
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,668
That's something. Oh, yeah.

1683
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,128
I've been unemployed for
the last eight years...

1684
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,669
because I have to write "sexual
offender" on every job application.

1685
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,195
I'm on a neighborhood
watch list...

1686
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,672
because I have to
register as a predator.

1687
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,478
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...

1688
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,179

through what happened?

1691
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,349
I meet Amy at this
party, you know?

1692
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,017
We click. She's perfect.

1693
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,403
She's beautiful, she's
smart, she's well-read...

1694
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,734
she's got an ass like a
20-year-old stripper.

1695
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,570
I think, "What's the catch?"

1696
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1697
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,493
Girls like a
fixer-upper, but Amy?

1698
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,000
She annexed me. She
made me her business.

1699
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,834
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.

1700
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,090
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1701
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,876
Ties. The whole thing
just became...

1702
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,340
So, you broke up with her.

1703
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,717
No, I just backed away.

1704
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,554
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?

1705
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,263
So I thought.

1706
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,599
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...

1707
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,561
with a bottle of bourbon and a
bootleg of this band I love.

1708
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,602
And within two minutes, she's got
my pants around my ankles...

1709
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,236
and she is kneeling down, and...

1710
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,271
I'm sorry.
I know it's your wife.

1711
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,190
You had sex?
Yeah, consensual.

1712
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,451
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.

1713
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,245
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.

1714
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,369
Amy has wounds that are
consistent with rape.

1715
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,581
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.

1716
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,293
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.

1717
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,798
Me!

1718
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,584
And then, guess what they find.

1719
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,798
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.

1720
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,428
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1721
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,930
You do know your wife.

1722
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,307
Did you ever see her again?
Yeah.

1723
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,888
On TV, last week, with you.

1724
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,765
I thought, "There's Amy."

1725
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,933
"She's graduated from being
raped to being murdered."

1726
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,476

01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,499
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1814
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,375
I wanted to help.

1815
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,759
Well, I hope you don't
mind me coming by.

1816
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,006
I got your address from this
letter that you wrote my wife.

1817
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,252
Amy and I believe in the
lost art of letter-writing.

1818
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:04,264
I always wondered why you
kept in touch after...

1819
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,095
everything.

1820
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,556
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1821
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,766
She was my first
serious girlfriend.

1822
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,272
Why did you break up?

1823
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,599
That's a strange question.

1824
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,608
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1825
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,859
That's a rude question.

1826

Let me tell you
what Amy told me.

1827
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,614
She dumped you, you
completely unraveled.

1828
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,741
You stalked her, you
threatened her...

1829
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,279
and you attempted suicide in her
bed and were institutionalized.

1830
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:31,245
Your wife is missing, and you came
all this way to tell me this?

1831
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,627
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

it actually burned?

back to my office...

Andie and I would often...

01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,699

Another place where
Andie and I...

would occasionally
have relations.

Also a location... Oh, my God.

1881

We had limited options. A hotel.

Amy would have seen
the credit card bill.

Put it on Andie's credit card.

gives you another motive.

What a beautiful home.

I so appreciate you giving
us this time, Nick.

2719
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:11,699
You went on national
television...

2720
02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:14,206
and told people that
I murdered my wife.

2721
02:20:14,364 --> 02:20:15,490
I go where the story goes.

2722
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:18,501
You implied that I had carnal
relations with my sister.

2723
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,085
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2724
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:26,923
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:29,880
Ice-breaker.

It's for you.

Open it.

2731

I don't need any
more gifts from you.

2732

Open it.

You didn't need to.

2735

Bullshit. That
notice of disposal.

2736
02:21:09,586 --> 02:21:10,963
I have that. You threw it out.

2737

The notice, yes.

You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2742
02:21:19,888 --> 02:21:22,607
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2743

I won't have to teach
your child to hate you.

Yes, I loved you.

And then all we did was resent each
other, and try to control each other.
