1
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,244
<i>You know, there's nothing like
the experience of raising your first dog.</i>

2
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,414
<i>The simple joy of walking side by side
with your buddy...</i>

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,183
<i>...out in the fresh air, throwing a stick.</i>

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,255
{\an8}<i>Spending some quiet time,
just you and your very best friend.</i>

5
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,264
{\an8}<i>Of course, that wasn't my experience.</i>

6
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,133
<i>That kid's not even me.</i>

7
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,138
<i>That's me.</i>

8
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:16,543
<i>And that crazy hound I'm chasing
is Marley, the world's worst dog.</i>

9
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,811
Sorry.

10
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

11
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>But our story begins
before Marley was born...</i>

12
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,851
<i>...four years before,
on my wedding day...</i>

13
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,354
<i>...which happened to be the day
of the worst freak spring blizzard...</i>

14
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,258
<i>...in the history of southern Michigan,
the same day our car broke down.</i>

15
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,827
<i>But we didn't care.</i>

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,362
Oh, God, that feels so good.

17
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,204
So, what do you think that means,
a blizzard on your wedding day?

18
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,840
Is that good luck? Is that bad luck?

19
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,309
I think it's good luck.

20
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,880
-How did I get you?
-What?

21
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,851
Honestly, how did I--?
How did I get that lucky?

22
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,886
Well, you know...

23
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,324
...I get asked that question all the time.

24
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,394
Come on. Are you kidding, honey?

25
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,196
You're part of the plan.

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,599
-The plan?
-My plan.

27
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:19,572
Step one, meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

28
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,175
Done. Step two?

29
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,576
Marry you instead.

30
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,680
Then step three--

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,217
-I don't think I can take any more.
-You don't want to hear step three?

32
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,685
-What's step three?
-It's easy.

33
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,622
-Be gentle.
-Move someplace warmer.

34
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,624
I knew you were gonna say that.

35
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,006
-Okay.
-Thank you.

36
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,576
-All right, you know you got this, right?
-Oh, yeah. I got it.

37
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,312
-Who are you?
-I'm John Grogan?

38
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,782
No, you're John frigging Grogan,
who's about to get a job as a reporter...

39
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,620
...for a major metropolitan newspaper.

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,789
-I don't feel like getting out of the car.
-Well, you have to.

41
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,760
-Why don't we drive around the block?
-No, baby. Come on, get out of the car.

42
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,428
Get out.

43
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,633
-Now, who am I again?
-Oh, please.

44
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,771
-Sebastian says you won some award?
-Mitchy. Yeah, I have a Mitchy.

45
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,775
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

46
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,444
A Mitchy.

47
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:43,750
So tell me, what made you leave
the estimable <i>Kalamazoo Gazette?</i>

48
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:50,023
Well, as you know, Sebastian and I
were in college together, and he--

49
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,625
He was always saying
how great South Florida is...

50
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,395
...and that maybe my wife and I
might enjoy it here...

51
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,063
...so we decided to come down here.

52
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,799
-Are you a comedian too?
-Excuse me?

53
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,401
Like your friend over here?

54
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,805
-No.
-He's walking a very thin line.

55
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,874
It's a good thing he knows how to write.

56
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,510
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

57
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,480
Yes. Jenny Grogan, because
we're married. She took my name.

58
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,617
-She get the job at the <i>Post?</i>
-Yes, she did.

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,553
-Why didn't they want you over there?
-Well, I didn't apply.

60
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,023
Jenny's more of a feature writer,
and I'm more of a straight news writer.

61
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,426
I thought this would be a better fit
for that.

62
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,329
Think you're better
than the journalism-school graduates...

63
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,631
...that came here looking for work
this morning?

64
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,333
I don't know if I'm better. I--

65
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,536
What I do know is that I have a tendency
to surprise myself.

66
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,839
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing "Donkey Kong."

67
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:44,577
I never dreamed I'd get into college,
but I did, and I graduated with honors.

68
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,714
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

69
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,484
And I certainly never thought I'd get a girl
like Jenny Havens to marry me...

70
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,519
<i>...but I did.</i>

71
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,824
So?

72
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,992
They already got a guy
on the Metro desk.

73
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,995
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry, honey.

74
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,467
So they're putting me on a little thing
they like to call "Desert Storm."

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,535
-You got the job?
-Got the job.

76
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,370
You got the job, baby.

77
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,007
Oh, John Grogan, I knew it.
I just knew it.

78
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,744
Okay, look. Watch this. Look.

79
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,613
See what happens? Job: done.

80
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,849
-So, what's next? Lunch?
-House.

81
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,650
-House.
-House.

82
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,173
{\an8}<i>--that can transmit
remote television pictures...</i>

83
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,175
{\an8}<i>...of Iraqi ships and other targets.</i>

84
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,912
{\an8}Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

85
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,549
-"If they save even one life--"
-"It would be worth it.

86
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,986
And with that,
Janet Dickerson's eyes filled with tears."

87
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,154
Filled with tears.

88
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,489
{\an8}-Do you like that or is it too corny?
-Yeah.

89
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,192
{\an8}-No.
-Is it a little over-the-top?

90
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,029
Hey, honey, what happened
to the Desert Storm piece?

91
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,901
That's it. The injured girl's dad's
in Kuwait. Is that not in there?

92
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,070
{\an8}I think they cut that.

93
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,873
{\an8}They even--
They spelled your name wrong.

94
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,910
{\an8}-"John Gorgan."
-You're kidding.

95
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,078
-Let me see that. Are you joking?
-Forget it.

96
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,116
You know what? It's good. It's really
good. It's got the facts, it's got color.

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,485
-It's a really solid piece.
-Thanks.

98
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,088
I tried to breathe some life into it,
you know?

99
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,690
Yes.

100
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,092
{\an8}I like this article.
I'm almost done with yours.

101
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,129
{\an8}This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,831
{\an8}When you get to the next page...

103
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,834
{\an8}...you'll see that I talk
about what could happen.

104
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,236
{\an8}-Oh, okay, I see, it continues.
-Yeah.

105
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,743
{\an8}But actually,
the rest of it is really just okay.

106
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:02,615
{\an8}-It's actually kind of boring.
-No, no, it's-- I'm enjoying this.

107
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,954
{\an8}They really gave you a lot of space.

108
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,926
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

109
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,764
{\an8}How am I ever supposed to take care
of a kid if I can't even keep a plant alive?

110
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,601
{\an8}Well, what did you expect, man?
You bought a house.

111
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,737
-A house with a spare room.
-What's the matter with a spare room?

112
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,039
It's empty, John,
that's what's wrong with it.

113
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,741
And you know what else is empty?

114
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,142
-Her womb.
-Her womb.

115
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,778
-I'm worried Jenny's at like step seven.
-What?

116
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,549
She's got her whole life organized
and planned out according to these steps.

117
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,885
Okay, that's scary. Unbelievable.

118
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,286
You want my advice?

119
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,688
Get her, like, a bird
or a puppy or something.

120
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,856
What, like a parakeet?

121
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,726
Something other than you
that she has to take care of.

122
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,529
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

123
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,164
-You got a dog, you're a master.
-Master.

124
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,133
-You're still a guy.
-Still got a life.

125
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,802
-Exactly.
-And a dog.

126
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,772
Yeah, but you've stopped her clock
for a few years.

127
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,641
-I never had a dog.
-Nothing to it.

128
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,976
Feed them, walk them,
let them out now and again.

129
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,780
But it doesn't really matter.
You're not gonna take care of it, Jenny is.

130
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,615
-Sebastian!
-Yo.

131
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,717
Your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

132
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,287
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to Colombia.

133
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,125
I got a guy down there that says
he can put me next to Pablo Escobar.

134
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,593
I'm doing a piece.

135
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,330
I follow a single coca leaf
from the jungle to the streets of Miami.

136
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,300
Sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there--

137
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,135
Gorgan!

138
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,205
-Grogan.
-Grodin. A fire at the county dump.

139
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,675
-Methane leak.
-Methane?

140
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,810
Yeah, I want two paragraphs
for the blotter.

141
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,881
Methane.

142
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,150
Woodward and Bernstein,
eat your heart out.

143
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,220
What kind of dog?

144
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,090
-You remember Caroline?
-The nurse?

145
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,359
She was a nursery-school teacher,
I don't know.

146
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,330
Anyway, she had this great dog, Daisy.

147
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,933
-It was a Labradoodle.
-"Labradoodle"?

148
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,704
-Maybe a Labrador.
-All right, get her a Labrador.

149
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,907
Supposed to be just like kids,
only easier to train.

150
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,644
"Labradoodle"? Come on.

151
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,189
-This does not smell like an IHOP.
-We got a little surprise first.

152
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,357
Here we go.

153
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,726
Now, I want you to walk right here,
my dear.

154
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,127
Okay.

155
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,130
-Come on.
-Oh, God.

156
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,898
-Okay.
-Are you Grogan?

157
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,701
-Yes.
-Expected you an hour ago.

158
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,904
You're gonna like this. Step up.
It's all right. Okay?

159
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,706
-Sorry about the mess.
-Okay.

160
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,944
-And the noise. And the smell.
-What's happening?

161
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,912
Come on.

162
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,015
-Can I look?
-No, no. Almost, almost.

163
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,850
-Okay. Okay, ready?
-Really?

164
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,886
One, two, three, go.

165
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,156
-Happy birthday.
-What?

166
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,192
-God, they're adorable.
-Get in.

167
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,162
Oh, my-- My birthday's not for a month.

168
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,099
Oh, that's okay,
they can't leave for three weeks anyway.

169
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,771
-John, we didn't discuss this.
-I know, but it was a surprise. You can't.

170
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,774
-Hi, guys.
-Just rescued the mom last month.

171
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,010
Family that gave her up
didn't even know she was pregnant.

172
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,846
-You sure we're ready for this?
-Well, like I told you...

173
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,050
...you gotta wait three weeks
before you can bring them home.

174
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,818
-I'm not even gonna be here.
-Why?

175
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,788
-I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial.
-That's okay.

176
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,391
It'll give me a chance to bond with him
and get a head start on training him.

177
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,427
Get him squared away
before you get home.

178
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,995
-That's true.
-Yeah.

179
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:41,333
-Well, how are we gonna pick one?
-Girls are 300, boys are 275.

180
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,738
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

181
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,942
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

182
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,344
-Hello, puppy.
-This one likes you.

183
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,880
Clearance Puppy likes you.

184
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,952
-Well, that's your guy.
-I was gonna pick you anyway.

185
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,354
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

186
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,096
-Honey, be careful.
-We gotta double-time it a little bit here.

187
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,965
-I really wish I didn't have to go.
-It's gonna be great.

188
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,367
You spent eight months on this trial.
I'm jealous.

189
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,237
Really? Tax evasion?
That's what makes you jealous?

190
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,473
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

191
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,342
-Call me the minute you get him home.
-Okay. Okay.

192
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,912
-We also have to come up with a name.
-Yes, well, let's brainstorm it.

193
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,381
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

194
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,749
Are you gonna be okay?

195
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,485
-Worried about me with a puppy?
-I am.

196
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,854
-Me, John frigging Grogan? Come on.
-I know.

197
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,224
-Goodbye. I love you. You look pretty.
-Thank you. I love you. Bye.

198
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,998
How you doing there, buddy?

199
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,400
Kind of a big day for you.

200
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,840
Let's listen to the radio.
Awkward silences.

201
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,544
You like that? You like Bob Marley?

202
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,183
Bob. Would that be a good name? Bob.

203
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,851
Bob. Come here, Bob.

204
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:10,122
Or Robert when you got older?
More dignified?

205
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,359
Marley? You like that.

206
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,161
That has a nice ring to it.

207
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,396
Okay, whoa, come on.

208
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,865
It's better if you ride shotgun...

209
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,304
...because we don't wanna have
a car crash on our first real day together.

210
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,978
Okay, come here. Come here.

211
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,881
It's a big day. You can ride over here.

212
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,852
Maybe it's okay today,
just this one time.

213
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:47,026
If we get pulled over, we explain.
We explain what the circumstances are.

214
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,136
-What happened?
-The Millers got robbed.

215
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,472
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

216
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,141
Hey, buddy.

217
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,877
-He's got some teeth.
-Oh, yeah.

218
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,879
I'll just get him some water.

219
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,081
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard.

220
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,051
Gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him housetrained.

221
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,189
Marley, no, no. Marley, Marley, Marley.
Oh, no.

222
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,028
Hey, you've had enough food, Marley.
You've had two bowls of kibble.

223
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,232
You had half a seat belt in the car.

224
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,137
How are you still eating?

225
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,110
I don't understand where you can put it.

226
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,548
And here's the little box
where Marley is going to bunk down.

227
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,986
Pretty cozy. All right, good night.

228
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,560
You're gonna be okay.
I'm just right inside.

229
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,363
Sleep tight.

230
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,927
All right.

231
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:34,166
Come on, Marley.
You're killing me, you know that?

232
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,553
Oh, we've got some cleaning up to do
before the missus gets back.

233
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,056
All right.

234
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,494
I'm off to the airport, and you're gonna
ride out the rain right in your little box.

235
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,998
Just a little thunder.

236
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,067
Back in a flash.

237
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,728
-Hi.
-Get in here.

238
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,529
Oh, my God.

239
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,234
-Hi.
-How are you?

240
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,635
-How's my puppy?
-I'm okay.

241
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,706
A little tired, but I'm trying to stay dry.

242
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,376
-Really, how is he?
-He's waiting for you.

243
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,227
Do you hear that? Is that--?
I think that's Marley.

244
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,204
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

245
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,741
-This is not how I left it.
-How long did you leave him here?

246
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,211
I left him for maybe an hour, tops.
Did he eat the dry wall?

247
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,184
-Oh, that's not right.
-That's-- One little dog did that.

248
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,753
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

249
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,223
Does thunder scare you, mister?

250
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,093
Sweet boy.

251
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,495
Oh, look at us.

252
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,168
So I'm in this cave,
and I can feel the machine guns.

253
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,136
There's like nine of them around me.

254
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,672
-What, like AK-47s?
-Kalashnikovs.

255
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,208
-And then Escobar comes in and says--
-Escobar?

256
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,779
Yeah, he says,
"I read your piece on Qaddafi...

257
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,849
...and I think
you captured his narcissism perfectly."

258
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,653
-Can you believe that?
-Some of it.

259
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,588
I wish you could've been there.

260
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,459
But who's gonna cover the power struggle
down at the Rotary club in Delray?

261
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,794
Oh, it's been just crazy.

262
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,597
-Your time will come, amigo.
-I'll drink to that.

263
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,601
That was crazy. Oh, my God.

264
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,838
-Oh, my God.
-That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

265
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,406
Say hello, Marley.

266
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,708
-Can I hold him?
-Of course. Here you go.

267
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,612
-You're so cute.
-Oh, I love their puppy breath.

268
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,748
Oh, have you guys
met my buddy Sebastian?

269
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,684
Sebastian, Viviana. Nice to meet you.

270
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,152
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Shannon.

271
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,354
-Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?
-He's adorable.

272
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,757
I actually think the
"puppy instead of a baby" idea is working.

273
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,693
Yeah, it's certainly working for me.

274
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,496
Can I take him home?
You're so cute, yes, you are.

275
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,199
I can't let you have the puppy, but
you might have a shot with the big dog.

276
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,634
-Oh, yeah?
-I'm easy.

277
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,637
-Oh, you're easy?
-And I do tricks. I'm paper-trained.

278
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,840
Oh, no, no.

279
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,909
-Oh, my God.
-Marley.

280
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,378
-Marley!
-Come back, puppy.

281
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,880
Marley! Marley!

282
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,256
Marley!

283
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,725
Marley! Marley!

284
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,934
-Marley!
-Marley!

285
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,644
-Got him. Thanks.
-You have to be more careful, man.

286
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,548
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

287
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,684
You shouldn't bring a dog to
the dog beach until he's trained.

288
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,553
Okay, can I get the dog back?

289
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,822
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

290
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,259
This is the only beach in two counties
where dogs aren't banned.

291
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,664
Cops see anybody peeing or pooping
down by the water, they'll shut us down.

292
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,699
Why is that funny to you?

293
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,969
I'm just very immature.

294
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,738
Calvin!

295
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,978
See? Aren't you glad you're not Calvin?
See how easy you got it?

296
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,316
Marley, stop.

297
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,719
Marley. Marley.

298
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,422
Honey, the dog's got my....

299
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,457
Marley, no.

300
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,561
Marley,
you can't go through a screen door.

301
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,740
Hey, Steve.

302
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,409
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too.

303
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,445
Marley.

304
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,651
It just seems like there's other guys.
Don't understand why you thought of me.

305
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,021
-I'm in a bind.
-Yeah, but I'm a reporter, not a columnist.

306
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,457
John, you'll get better pay.

307
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,560
You can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

308
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,328
Why are you hesitating?

309
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,030
-I'm thinking.
-No, you're hesitating.

310
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,499
I'm offering a promotion
and you're hesitating.

311
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,635
I never saw myself as a columnist.

312
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,639
Oh, well, think of it as one of those times
when you surprise yourself.

313
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,806
Okay.

314
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,343
It's only a couple of times a week
until I get a replacement for Jerry.

315
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,313
Then you can go back to doing
whatever it was you were doing.

316
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,050
-What were you doing?
-Obituaries, methane leaks.

317
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,785
-Are you okay with this?
-Yes.

318
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:27,986
You don't seem thrilled.

319
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,056
-No, it's a promotion.
-We can take away the raise if you like.

320
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,358
No, no, I'm-- Thank you.

321
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,727
All right, now you're talking.
Go on, get to work.

322
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,032
Marley.
I think he dislocated my shoulder.

323
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,870
He doesn't even heel.
Doesn't walk, he just sprints.

324
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,939
Marley. God.

325
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,976
Marley, stop. Down here. Come on.

326
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,478
I had to pull him off three dogs today.

327
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,814
-Poodles?
-Among others.

328
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,083
I say we give him away to a farm.

329
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,853
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

330
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,990
Well, usually you train them.

331
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,726
Or you train them.
Come on, down. Come on.

332
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,795
What are you doing?

333
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,964
Arnie gave me a column.

334
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,468
Are you kidding? Baby, that's great.

335
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,836
Oh, yeah, it's a big honor.

336
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:22,107
I get to write about zoning laws
and give my opinion on yard sales.

337
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,544
Whoa, down, boy.
Easy with the enthusiasm.

338
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,047
No, it's just I don't even read this crap
when other people write it.

339
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,518
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

340
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,021
And you've got nothing for Tuesday.

341
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:41,359
-No, I got nothing for Tuesday.
-I bet you're gonna think of something.

342
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:46,965
See, this gives me a little inspiration,
but it's not for a column. It's more like--

343
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,668
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

344
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,870
Marley, stop.

345
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,639
Marley, you're incorrigible.

346
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:59,544
"Incorrigible." I don't believe in that word.
Every dog wants to learn.

347
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,513
Hey, come here, baby.

348
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,984
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl, yes, you are.

349
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,020
Of course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

350
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,690
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty strong-willed, but....

351
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,093
-Marley. Sorry.
-Say hello to Marley.

352
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,629
So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

353
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,732
We both thought we would.
We'd like him to listen to both of us.

354
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,000
We're married, so yeah.

355
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,036
No, no, no.
A dog can only have one master.

356
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,773
Which one of you
has the most natural authority...

357
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,508
...in your own relationship?

358
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,145
Well, maybe I'll stand over there
for the beginning.

359
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,480
I thought so. Shall we?

360
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,786
-Jeez.
-All right. Sit.

361
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,987
-Sit.
-Sit.

362
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,155
Sit.

363
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,759
Sit. Marley. Okay, Marley. Marley, sit.

364
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,029
This, class, is a classic example...

365
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,800
...of a dog who has foolishly
been allowed to believe...

366
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,537
...he is the alpha male of the pack.

367
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,606
And therefore,
he can never be a happy animal.

368
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,009
Yeah, he looks pretty miserable.

369
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,778
You, joker.

370
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,549
Rotate in. And lose the sunglasses.

371
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,617
A dog likes to be looked at in the eye.

372
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,821
-I got it. Okay.
-Okay.

373
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,556
-You got him? Okay.
-Yep.

374
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,825
So collar your dogs.

375
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,795
Good boy.

376
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,835
All right, dogs on the left.
On the count of three.

377
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,938
One, two, three. Let's go.

378
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,639
Walk. Walk.

379
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,841
-Very nice.
-Heel.

380
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,710
-<i>Go.</i>
-Very good.

381
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,213
Good.

382
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,650
-Hey.
-Correct him. Rein in that dog.

383
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,788
All right. All right, class.
Come on, let's line up again.

384
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:55,560
Class, it's a simple question of
having confidence in your own authority.

385
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,965
I shall now demonstrate a simple walk,
all right?

386
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,500
-Come here.
-Mr. Grogan.

387
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,803
-Sorry.
-May I?

388
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:09,875
All right, even an unruly dog
likes to obey his leader.

389
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,845
Marley, heel.

390
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,582
There.

391
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:23,021
Marley. Marley. Marley! Marley!

392
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,092
Marley.

393
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,001
Careful. Marley, no! Marley!

394
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,610
-Are you okay?
-That's it. He is out.

395
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:50,782
-He usually only does this with poodles.
-That dog is a bad influence on the others.

396
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,719
No. Leg humping is like a virus.

397
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,589
Once it takes hold of the group.... No.

398
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,025
-Okay.
-He has got to go.

399
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,061
It was maybe your hair.

400
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,663
It reminded him of a poodle.

401
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,933
-Never bring him back.
<i>-Okay.</i>

402
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,702
Right from the beginning,
she had me in her sights.

403
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,772
-I know, she really did.
-Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

404
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:19,044
That's why he got kicked out.
You are now the world's worst dog.

405
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,212
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

406
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,215
You know,
there is something else that we could do.

407
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,352
No, I know, we just-- We get an--

408
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,589
No, no, no.

409
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,092
I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

410
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:40,765
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

411
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,971
I can't tell you that,
because you know it's a lie.

412
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,039
Poor son of a bitch.

413
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,843
Okay, you wanna come up?
Yeah, that's the least I can do.

414
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,079
-Get a little fresh air.
-Marley.

415
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,049
Oh, gosh,
it's like he's walking the plank.

416
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,151
That's what breaks my heart.
He's so happy.

417
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,722
-He doesn't know what's coming.
-Honey, he's gonna be fine.

418
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:08,727
-Oh, no, no, now I'm getting nervous.
-He's okay. He's just getting a little air.

419
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,833
It's like <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

420
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,269
-Whoa, Marley.
-John, please, grab him.

421
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,007
-Oh, my God.
-He's making a break for it.

422
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,809
-Marley!
-He's onto our evil plan.

423
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,012
-Pull over.
-I can't stop here. I can't.

424
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,116
-Honey, pull over.
-I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

425
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,222
-Come on, pull over.
-All right, all right, all right.

426
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,225
Oh, jeez.

427
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,727
-I need a little help here.
-I know.

428
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,229
-Hey. Get a leash.
-Oh, shut up.

429
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:48,266
Hey, he's losing his balls today.
Cut him some slack.

430
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,368
-Got him? Careful, careful.
-I got him.

431
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,912
And this is a rough draft because I want--
I'd like to take another pass at it.

432
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,184
The beginning, I think I might wanna--

433
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,121
I think we can maybe lose that
because I think it gets a little bit jokey.

434
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,192
I just reread it.
I didn't think it worked at all.

435
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,062
-I'm sorry. I'm gonna do the zoning piece.
-Wait a minute.

436
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,331
What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

437
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,034
-Really?
-I'm laughing my head off at this.

438
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,238
Getting kicked out of obedience school,
the humping, the great escape.

439
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,275
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

440
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:34,212
It's hysterical stuff. Run it the way it is.

441
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,316
Thanks.

442
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,453
Listen, you know what makes it work?

443
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,089
What makes it work
is that you put yourself into it.

444
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,924
-I like that.
-Good.

445
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,959
Look, I know you're a reporter and all...

446
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,228
...but could you do a few more like this?

447
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,830
-Sure.
-Great.

448
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,333
-Okay, great.
-And tell your dog not to feel too bad.

449
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,436
Sooner or later, we all lose our balls.

450
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,005
Right. Good to know.

00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,542
<i>Watched him steal some guy's Frisbee.
Bought new Frisbee. Gave Marley a bath.</i>

456
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,346
<i>Went to work with writer's block.</i>

472
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,457
<i>Found one tiny orange on our tree.
Jenny very pleased with herself.</i>

473
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,295
<i>Found my first gray hair. Found
Jenny's first. Bought Jenny flowers.</i>

474
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,932
<i>Rescued our new mailman from Marley.
Rescued the UPS guy from Marley.</i>

475
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>Invited my parents.</i>

476
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,070
<i>Took them out to dinner at a cool place.

<i>Picked oranges from our tree.
Made orange juice.</i>

<i>Drove down to Miami for Bark
in the Park night at the Marlins game.</i>

495
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,260
<i>Brought Marley,
who turned out to be a fan.</i>

496
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,662

502
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,981
<i>Drank mimosas. Met a doctor

<i>Wrote a column about writing columns.</i>

505
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,024
<i>Came home to find Jenny dancing

506
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,064
<i>Tried to think of reasons
not to have a baby now...</i>

507
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,933
...nada.

508
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,570
Why don't you just let him off the leash?

509
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,107
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

510
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,410
It's been two years.
He's never had an accident.

511
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,211
Because I never let him off leash.

512
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,282
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

513
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,517
Nope.

514
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,120
Okay, so, what's next?

515
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,191
-Ice cream?
-No, I mean on your list.

516
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,693
-My list?
-Jen, the list.

517
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,063
Your play list you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

518
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,365
-It was basically my marching orders.
-My plan?

519
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,336
Your plan. I wanna know what's next.
Scare me.

520
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,005
-You really wanna know?
-Hit me.

521
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,308
Well, it's a tossup between a new roof...

522
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,543
Very practical.

523
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,547
--and a baby.

524
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,757
I could live with a few leaks.

525
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,760
-Really?
-Yeah, a couple.

526
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,629
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak.

527
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,733
And then that big leak
becomes a very big responsibility.

528
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,101
That's true.

529
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,237
We may wanna think about
fixing a lot of things before we start--

530
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,672
Well, we already fixed Marley.

531
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,376
If we fix too many more things,
I think this conversation becomes moot.

532
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,212
John, are you serious?

533
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,647
Yeah. I think so.

534
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,350
You realize we're not talking
about an actual roof?

535
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,487
Yes, I got that.
About halfway through, I picked it up.

536
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,721
Good metaphor, though.

537
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,791
You're not just saying this
because it'll lead to funny columns?

538
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,328
Well, I mean, honey, come on.
I mean, if I get some funny columns...

539
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,131
...that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

540
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,267
I mean, I'm ready. I mean, if you are.

541
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,536
Instead of trying to have a baby...

542
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,807
...why don't we just stop
trying not to have one?

543
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,710
Okay, if I'm following you correctly,
and I think I am...

544
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,347
...this is the part where we head back,
we take it off, and we get it on.

545
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,316
Yes, but you'll--
It'll have a little more romance than that.

546
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,719
Yeah, we'll get some candles, some Sade.
Of course.

547
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,421
Sade.

548
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,494
-Honey?
-Yeah.

549
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,064
Did you have kibble today?

550
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,199
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

551
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,435
He's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

552
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,171
Trust me, he knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

553
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,740
-Go on, Marley. You have to go.
-Oh, baby, please focus.

554
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay, you're right.

555
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,384
Good. Good.
It's even better than the last one.

556
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,519
-Thank you.
-You're very good, Gorgan.

557
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,423
I like that piece you did in Boca
on the woman. What did you call her?

558
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,192
-Bocahontas.
-Bocahontas.

559
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,494
Is that true?
She had her boobs done four times?

560
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,863
-That's what she said.
-Hysterical.

561
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,866
And is that true about you and your wife
trying to have a kid?

562
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,403
Well, you know, we're not really trying,
because we don't wanna--

563
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,338
-How does that work?
-What do you mean?

564
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,574
-Well, I mean, are you having sex?
-Yeah.

565
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,776
-Did you pull the goalie?
-Yeah.

566
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,746
Then you're trying. Congratulations.
Good work.

567
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,649
-You're not "trying" trying.
-Oh, yeah.

568
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,352
Of course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

569
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,489
All due respect,
but does anybody ever read your column?

570
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,259
Come on, I bring Marley here to help you
run your game on these poor girls...

571
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,827
...and this is the thanks we get.

572
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,131
-How long you been at it?
-A few months.

573
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,867
-What changed your mind?
-Well, here's the thing.

574
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,372
I'm actually married to someone,
and I care about what she wants.

575
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,775
-Well, is it what you want?
-Yeah.

576
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:49,380
-I guess that answers my other question.
-Yeah?

577
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:53,384
I'm about to do a piece on the growth
of the domestic drug trade for <i>The Times.</i>

578
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,453
You're freelancing
for <i>The New York Times?</i>

579
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,290
Yeah, yeah, but it's a big story,
too big for one guy...

580
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,759
...and I was hoping you'd write it
with me.

581
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,396
Are you kidding me?

582
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,666
-It would be a chance to work together.
-Yeah, I would love that.

583
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,569
Of course, it will be a lot of work,
a lot of travel.

584
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,538
I would hope so.

585
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,241
Maybe not the best job
for somebody with a kid on the way.

586
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,612
Well, that's not necessarily happening
right this very second.

587
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,281
Let me talk it ov--

588
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,383
There she is.

589
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,553
-Honey, how are you?
<i>-Hi.</i>

590
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,523
I'm just calling to let you know
that there is a naked woman in your bed.

591
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,794
Why don't the two of you get started
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

592
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:41,265
That's very funny.
But seriously, can you come home now?

593
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,738
Hey. We're home.

594
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,774
Hi.

595
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,876
You know the baby thing?

596
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,779
I've been thinking
maybe we should take a break.

597
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,982
You know?

598
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,917
I mean, obviously it's not working...

599
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,589
...and maybe it's nature's way
of saying now's not the right timing.

600
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,461
I mean, maybe it's a sign
that we're not quite ready for this, that--

601
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,598
-I mean, have we really thought this--?
-John.

602
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:14,966
I'm pregnant.

603
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,003
Great.

604
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,007
-Great. Really?
-Yeah.

605
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,276
-Yes.
-You were just saying--?

606
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,879
No, don't worry, that was like--
It sounds so awkward now.

607
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,918
Like I just had this, like, very, you know,
idiotic soliloquy that doesn't apply...

608
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,953
...and I'm really excited.

609
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,456
-Do you wanna start over?
-I would love to.

610
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,858
-That would be great. Can we? Good.
-By all means.

611
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:49,967
-I'm pregnant.
-What? No! Yes!

612
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,305
-Don't make the same mistake I did.
-What?

613
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,476
There's gonna come a time very soon
where her ankles are gonna swell up.

614
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,810
No, no, I'm ready for that.

615
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,946
She's gonna have blotches
all over her face.

616
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,914
-Yeah.
-She'll be 40 pounds overweight.

617
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,884
-She'll be throwing up all the time.
-I'm not ready for that.

618
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:11,289
She's gonna look at you and say,
"You bastard. You did this to me."

619
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,958
What happened to the glow,
the, you know, the--?

620
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,660
There's no glow.

621
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,996
Get her a gift.
That will dissipate some of the anger.

622
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,931
Some earrings, a bracelet.

623
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,802
That's thoughtful. That's a good idea.
In fact, maybe I'll get on it right now.

624
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,905
There's a jewelry store on the corner.
Mention my name.

625
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,677
Oh, John.

626
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,413
It's just beautiful.

627
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,549
It's just beautiful.

628
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,751
-Honey, thank you.
-You're welcome.

629
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,987
I was just walking by
just thinking of you...

630
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,956
...and I saw that in the window and I go,
"I'm getting this."

631
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,026
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah, well....

632
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,561
-Do you like it?
-I love it.

633
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,497
Put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

634
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,568
-Where'd it go? I just had it.
-You just set it down. Did you drop it?

635
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,838
-No, I put it right here.
-Well, it didn't just disappear.

636
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,840
Oh, God.

637
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,380
-Marley. No, Marley, spit it out.
-No, go to the kitchen, go to the kitchen.

638
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:14,085
Okay. No, no, no.
Marley, I have a treat. Come here.

639
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,456
Stay. Marley, stay.

640
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,525
Good boy. Yeah.

641
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,998
-Marley!
-Good going, honey.

642
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,470
Marley.

643
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,005
Come here, Marley.

644
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,609
Jeez.

645
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,115
-Okay, okay. Marley, drop it.
-Marley.

646
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,717
-Gross. Is it there?
-Marley.

647
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,819
Oh, honey, I don't see it.

648
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,025
Marley, you've gotta lay off
the mangoes.

649
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,130
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

650
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,466
...somehow standing in the backyard
hosing down your crap...

651
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,904
...looking for my wife's swallowed,
recycled, ass-kissing gift...

652
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,806
...never jumped to mind.

653
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,810
Which shows you've gotta dream big
because-- Jackpot.

654
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:17,782
My, that's a lovely necklace.
It's so shiny.

655
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,052
-Yes, it is.
-And how's that crazy dog of yours?

656
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,522
I read your columns every week.

657
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,625
-So you're the one.
-I am.

658
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,760
You'll get a kick
out of next week's column.

659
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,430
The heartbeat will be very fast,
like a little train.

660
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,199
-That's normal.
-Is it too early to tell the sex?

661
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,067
I-- Not that I care.

662
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,771
It can be male, female,
whatever sex he wants.

663
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,642
Unambiguous genitalia
if I had my druthers, but....

664
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,844
Hang on.

665
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,981
Sometimes you can't hear it.

666
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,818
-You're 10 weeks, right?
-Monday I'll be 10 weeks.

667
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,222
Well, it might be a little too early for that.
Let's go right to the sonogram.

668
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,957
Did you bring your blank tape?

669
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,626
-Oh, yes.
-Yes, yes.

670
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,029
That's warm.

671
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,631
-Let's get a good picture for you first.
-Okay.

672
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,234
It'll be right up on the monitor here.

673
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,077
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

674
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,190
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

675
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,193
Let's take a look at your baby, shall we?

676
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,197
All right.

677
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,073
Is there anything there?

678
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,945
Not what you would expect to see
at 10 weeks.

679
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,549
-I'm not quite 10 weeks.
-Monday.

680
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,785
-It's still, I guess, nine weeks.
-Yeah, nine weeks.

681
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,023
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

682
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,094
I'm very, very sorry.

683
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,631
These things, they happen sometimes.
We don't know why, though.

684
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,168
But you're young, you have your health.
Couple months, you guys can try again.

685
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,072
I'm sorry. All right?

686
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,276
I'm gonna leave you alone for a moment,
and then we'll talk more.

687
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,578
I'm very sorry.

688
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,802
Well, in a couple months,
we can try again, okay?

689
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,963
Want some tea?

690
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,069
Hey, you know what?
I was thinking that we....

691
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,105
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

692
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,808
...for the honeymoon in Ireland.

693
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,179
We could finally do that.
Maybe take some time off.

694
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,215
Jenny?

695
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,163
-Oh, he's big.
-Oh, yeah, he's a hundred pounds.

696
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,233
-Now, he just wants to say hello here.
-Yeah, he loves people.

697
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:33,270
Now, just be calm and you just stay still.
And you're a dog person, right?

698
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,706
-Actually, I'm--
-Ready? Here we go.

699
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,009
Marley, you can say hello. Oh, no, no, no.
No, don't let him do that.

700
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,844
You just knee him if he does that.

701
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:44,181
It shouldn't happen all the time,
just when you walk through the door.

702
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,417
This will tell you everything
you need to know.

703
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,920
-I've got the bags here.
-You got everything? Okay. Thank you.

704
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,856
-All right. Come on, honey.
-Will you get the door?

705
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,893
-Okay, here we are.
-Come on, honey, we're really late.

706
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,262
<i>Debby, welcome to our home.</i>

707
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,799
<i>Marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction.</i>

708
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,267
<i>We've never left him before...</i>

709
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,704
<i>...but we are sure he'll behave
just as he does when we're at home.</i>

710
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,177
<i>There are just a few things about Marley
you're gonna need to know.</i>

711
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,913
<i>He eats three times a day.</i>

712
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,949
<i>If he looks starved, feed him again.</i>

713
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,420
<i>Now, of course, all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere...</i>

714
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:27,424
<i>...so use the blue pooper-scooper
and watch your step.</i>

715
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,327
<i>Don't worry about the color.
He likes mangoes.</i>

716
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,263
<i>Marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet...</i>

717
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,835
<i>...so be sure to keep the lid closed
and the brick on the lid.</i>

718
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:41,171
<i>Actually, you might wanna just
keep the bathroom door shut in general.</i>

719
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,241
<i>Like most dogs,
Marley needs a lot of exercise...</i>

720
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:48,812
<i>...so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening.</i>

721
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,914
Marley.

722
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,851
Let go, let go, let go. Marley!

723
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,154
<i>And be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep.</i>

724
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,191
<i>But don't worry,
Marley is an excellent watchdog.</i>

725
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,096
<i>You can rest easy at night
knowing he's on the job.</i>

726
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,332
<i>Thunderstorms are his weak point.</i>

727
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,268
<i>You can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving.</i>

728
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,838
Okay. Here you go.
Marley. Marley, come back here.

729
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,006
<i>He doesn't like them...</i>

730
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,375
<i>...so push them down his throat
as far as they go.</i>

731
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,812
Welcome, welcome. I'm Mrs. Butterly.

732
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:26,150
<i>Now, finally, we do not allow Marley
to get up on any piece of furniture...</i>

733
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,319
<i>...or chew on anything except his toys.</i>

734
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,991
<i>Other than that, enjoy him.
Love, Jenny and John.</i>

735
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:38,829
We serve tea every day at 4
and dinner at 6 sharp.

736
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, and these blankets are woolen.
Good heat in them.

737
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,236
-So they're electric?
-Oh, not in this house.

738
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,907
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

739
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,509
In this room, actually.

740
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,813
Oh, not to worry. It's been repapered.

741
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,517
Well, good night to you both
and God bless you.

742
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,520
Thank you. You-- Bless you.

743
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,993
That was just weird.

744
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,332
Oh, gosh.

745
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:21,071
Honey, I know that we haven't had sex
since, you know...

746
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,141
...but I don't think
we're breaking that streak tonight.

747
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,445
No, I don't wanna break the streak here.
This doesn't feel--

748
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:34,918
I mean, I think I could, you know,
handle God watching and his mother...

749
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,956
...but not this little porcelain pontiff
right here.

750
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,359
It's July and I think I can see my breath.

751
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,329
-Honey, I can't feel my toes.
-That's not good.

752
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:49,266
I'm gonna check on that.

753
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,370
-Oh, good God.
-That's not the bed.

754
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:58,108
It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

755
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,579
Do you wanna join them?

756
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,049
Really?

757
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,554
We don't have to.

758
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:15,292
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in 50 years is just....

759
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,527
It's kind of turning me on.

760
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,334
Honey, I missed you.

761
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,463
-Marley. Hi, honey.
-Marley.

762
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,500
-Oh, come here. Oh, my God.
-Hi. We missed you so much.

763
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,035
-Hey, Debby.
-Hey.

764
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,437
There were 11 thunderstorms
while you were gone.

765
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,308
Eleven. And you were right,
he doesn't like thunderstorms.

766
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,543
Okay, yeah, 11.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

767
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:10,314
Oh, and just so you know,
I am a dog person, but that's not a dog.

768
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,016
That is evil with a dog face
that is humping my leg...

769
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,218
...and peeing on your carpet.

770
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,355
-Marley. Marley.
-Marley, stop that.

771
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,731
Marley, come on, it's just thunder.
No barking.

772
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,138
Marley, come on. It's just thunder.

773
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,442
Marley, come on.

774
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,478
Jenny!

775
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,647
Can you help me out here?

776
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,050
I got 20 minutes to file this column,
and I gotta--

777
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,618
Jenny?

778
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,489
-The luck of the Irish.
-What?

779
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,297
Oh, God. John. Honey.

780
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,567
John. John, wake up, honey. It's time.

781
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,405
Okay, what do I need?
Oh, these will be comfortable. Okay.

782
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,574
You all right? You all right?

783
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,177
Are you okay?
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt her.

784
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,412
Try not to scream.
I don't want him to kill me.

785
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,614
You remembered
to install the car seat, right?

786
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,583
They won't let us take the baby home--

787
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,585
-I wouldn't forget.
-I know, I'm sorry.

788
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,555
-Got that right there?
-I think I got it. What else?

789
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,326
Yeah, come on, Marley,
help me out here.

790
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:41,598
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

791
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,334
Good, yeah.

792
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,737
No, no, you're gonna stay here.

793
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,507
I'll leave you this bone
to keep you busy now.

794
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,878
Hopefully no thunderstorms. And I'm off.

795
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,868
Who's your daddy? Come here.

796
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,913
Here's the thing.

797
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,916
In about two minutes,
we're gonna bring home the baby...

798
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,188
...and you'd be doing me a really big favor
if you didn't freak out.

799
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,758
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

800
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,664
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready, yes.

801
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,200
-Okay.
-Hi, come here.

802
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,371
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Marley.

803
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,608
Come on. Come here. Okay?

804
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,913
-Marley.
-Would be a bummer if you ate the baby.

805
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:11,555
-Just....
-Look, Marley, this is Patrick.

806
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,827
Not to be confused with a chew toy,
although it may look like one.

807
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,497
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

808
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,966
Very good.

809
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,445
Yeah. No, I have a quote for it
right here.

810
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,715
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

811
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,884
They told me it was on the record.

812
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,987
I don't-- Patrick, honey,
be careful with those toys.

813
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,690
You know Marley gets--
Carla, I'm not talking to you.

814
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,994
Will you just call them and get a release?
I'll call you back. I'll call you right back.

815
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,862
Ready?

816
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,331
How far do you wanna go?

817
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,484
Those days are over for us, amigo.

818
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,886
We had a good run, though.

819
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,609
Hey, look. There's Daddy.

820
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,047
Come on, Marley.

821
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,017
This is gonna sound crazy,
but what's that thing called...

822
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,319
...when you owe money on a house?

823
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,987
-It starts with an M.
-Mortgage.

824
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,822
Mortgage.

825
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,559
Is it possible to be this tired?

826
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,396
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

827
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,465
No, you won't. You don't hear him.

828
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,369
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah, well, why?

829
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,438
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

830
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,807
I do have to go
into the office tomorrow, though.

831
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,844
-Will you watch him then for me?
-It would be my pleasure.

832
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:19,516
-How long are we talking about?
-I don't know.

833
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:24,621
-It's not quite what you expected, huh?
-I don't know what I expected.

834
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,090
I never thought Marley
would seem like the easy one.

835
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,060
I know. I know, but you know what?

836
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,696
We adjusted to him...

837
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,798
...and we'll adjust to the baby.

838
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,568
I'm just trying to remember us
from before.

839
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,905
-You mean those younger...
-Yeah.

840
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,507
...sexier, better-looking people?

841
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,742
-Yeah.
-I remember them.

842
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:49,446
-I remember them vaguely.
-I miss them.

843
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,448
They're here.

844
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,417
They're here, they're just really tired.

845
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,123
What, now you're jealous?

846
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,595
Stay here.

847
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,865
-Call the police.
-Okay.

848
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,146
Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right?
What happened?

849
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,417
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

850
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,820
-I screamed and he stabbed me.
-Sit down, just sit down.

851
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,756
It's okay, it's all right.

852
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,891
-Where's your mother?
-At work.

853
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:39,162
It's okay, it's not that bad.
Keep your hand placed right here.

854
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:40,930
Okay.

855
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,501
My wife called the police,
so everything's gonna be okay.

856
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,139
In all the time I've lived here,
I've never gotten your name.

857
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:53,009
-Lisa.
-Okay, I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

858
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,912
You're gonna keep your hands
placed there...

859
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,848
...and we're gonna wait for the police
to get here.

860
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:02,552
They're gonna take care of this, all right?

861
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,054
Okay? Look at me.

862
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,791
It's all right. It's all right.

863
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,526
<i>Safest neighborhood?</i>

864
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,861
In terms of crime,
I'd say you're looking at Boca.

865
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,731
Boca?
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

866
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,468
-That's the way it is, John.
-Okay, thanks.

867
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,671
Boca. Not so bad.

868
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,108
You got kids playing in the street.
I don't know, what do you guys think?

869
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,578
We might live here one day,
if we can afford it.

870
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:32,582
There we go. I can get you right here.

871
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,553
Stay. Marley, no.

872
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,122
Marley. Marley.

873
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,926
And don't you love this kitchen?
Look at the state-of-the-art appliances.

874
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:46,095
And my favorite part, the pool, is....

875
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,135
-Why don't we look over here?
-Sorry, can I get a brochure?

876
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,704
-Sure.
-Thank you. Looks nice.

877
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,575
Whose dog is that?

878
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,713
Jenny?

879
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,850
Honey.

880
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:08,985
Jen?

881
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,157
Hey. You okay?

882
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,861
-Yeah, I'm good. Where have you been?
-I wanna show you something.

883
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:23,533
It's a house. Now, it's a little pricey,
but I think we can do it.

884
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,602
-Boca?
-I know, I know.

885
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,872
But Frank Bennet on the Metro desk
says it's the safest neighborhood.

886
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,208
-I'm just not sure now is the right time.
-But when is the right time?

887
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,611
After one of us gets stabbed
in the driveway?

888
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,247
-John.
-Honey, it's cramped in here.

889
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,749
This was supposed to be
a three-year house.

890
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:41,017
I know. I know that.

891
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,820
I just don't think we can afford
to buy a new one.

892
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,989
But, honey, we can.
With both our salaries--

893
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,223
Honey, I'm pregnant.

894
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,993
Really?

895
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,028
Are you sure?

896
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,632
Come here.

897
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,741
Pretty sure.

898
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,110
Four for four.

899
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,746
-Hold on.
-That's great.

900
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,981
Congratulations.

901
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,784
-Come on.
-I mean, to both of us.

902
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,987
Oh, yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

903
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,325
-Another baby.
-I know.

904
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,928
Honey, I think I have to quit my job.

905
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,230
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

906
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,766
No, I don't want any help. I really don't.

907
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,802
I really-- I just don't want--
Will you hand me that pacifier?

908
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,071
I just--
I don't wanna be one of those people...

909
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,074
...that sees their child
for an hour at night.

910
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,577
-I don't.
-I know, but you love your work and--

911
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,613
I do, I love my work, honey,
but this is killing me.

912
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,649
When I'm at the office,
I just wanna be here.

913
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:50,653
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

914
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,690
And I just know
that I'm doing both jobs halfway.

915
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,658
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

916
00:59:55,792 --> 01:00:01,297
Look, if I have to give up something,
I do not wanna give up this.

917
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,200
<i>Why should I give you a raise?
Give me one good reason.</i>

918
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,837
-Because I'm doing a good job?
-Is that a question?

919
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,240
No, but since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

920
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,109
So you are doing a good job.

921
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,245
Yes, if you go by the circulation
and popularity.

922
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,948
Okay. Why not make it permanent?

923
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,250
What do you mean, like forever?

924
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,120
Yeah, that's what "permanent" means.

925
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,857
John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.

926
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,959
Everybody in that entire room.

927
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:33,396
And you've taken the column
and you've turned it into something fresh.

928
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:37,233
I know you don't wanna hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

929
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,203
Why are you hesitating?

930
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,373
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

931
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,142
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea.

932
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,310
I'll tell you what.

933
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,880
You take on a daily column,
I will double your salary.

934
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,260
Gonna start you off
with some corn flakes.

935
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,962
The most important meal-- No, Marley.

936
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:44,067
Most important meal of the day. There.
I might take a little spoonful.

937
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,038
John, please, just take him for a sec.
I gotta take a shower. I gotta go.

938
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,339
But it happens every time.

939
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:53,142
Well, you've got to spend more time
with him.

940
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,078
Down.

941
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,046
Marley.

942
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,085
There you go.

943
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,088
-Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

944
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:09,225
You say to spend more time with him,
and I do, and then you wanna take over.

945
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,461
I don't want you changing him
when you're mad.

946
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,964
-I'm not mad, I'm--
-Thank you. Come on.

947
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,200
Hi, baby. Come on, honey.

948
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,837
Oh, baby. I know, I know.

949
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,507
Oh, watch out. Oh, come on, Conor.
Come on, what?

950
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,009
What's the matter?
What do you need? What is it?

951
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:30,813
Do you want some food? Food? Milk?

952
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,915
No? Okay.

953
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,518
He's just colicky, Jen.
He'll grow out of it.

954
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:36,886
Well, here's an idea.

955
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,890
Why don't you stay home, and
I'll go to work while he grows out of it?

956
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,193
Sorry, I'm tired. Just go. Just go.

957
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,795
It's postpartum depression.

958
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,465
They're hormones go on tilt,
and they get depressed.

959
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,534
I remember
after my fourth kid was born...

960
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:55,438
...I'd wake up in the middle of the night
sometimes and my wife would be there...

961
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,875
...staring at me
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

962
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:01,277
I thought she was gonna kill me.

963
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,880
I still do.

964
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,215
You get her the gift?

965
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,986
-Yeah, and....
-Well, it usually works.

966
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,221
Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.

967
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,958
He's gonna have this picture
next to his byline for the next 20 years.

968
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,160
<i>What are you doing? Get in here.</i>

969
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,570
Patrick, honey, please, stop doing that.
You're gonna make him sick.

970
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,905
-Just eat it, okay?
-Careful, Patrick.

971
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,975
Remember what we did to Marley
when he didn't listen.

972
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,078
Honey, we really have to pick
out a color of fabric...

973
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,214
...for the curtains in the boys' room.

974
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:15,218
Okay, well, I don't know,
whatever you want.

975
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:19,255
I'd really like your help deciding.

976
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,627
No, let me get him.

977
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,462
Thank you.

978
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,972
Marley, just....

979
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:40,977
Marley. Bad dog. Marley. Marley, stop it.

980
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,081
Marley, let go. Let go.
Marley, let go. Marley.

981
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,217
Marley. Marley. Marley, get back here.
Get back here.

982
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,220
Marley. Marley. Bad dog.

983
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,522
Marley, get back here. Marley.

984
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:57,126
See, we were supposed to return these,
and now we have to pay for them.

985
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,229
-That's okay. Come on, just--
-No, it's not okay. It's not okay.

986
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,199
I told you not to leave anything edible
where he can get it.

987
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,668
I know, but you
wouldn't exactly say this is edible.

988
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,336
John, you know what I mean.

989
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,274
You said you'd get up early and walk him.
He chews things when he gets restless.

990
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,243
-I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.
-Know what? Forget it.

991
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,412
-I'm gonna do it myself.
-You don't have to--

992
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,014
Yes, I'm doing it myself.

993
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:23,286
You don't get it. She's gonna kill you.

994
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,289
You've got to take it easy.

995
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,557
We're both hanging by a thread.

996
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,261
-So who gets the dog if you guys split up?
-We're not splitting up.

997
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,630
-Out of the realm of possibility?
-Completely.

998
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,299
There's nothing she can do...

999
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,568
...no tantrum too big,
no depression too deep...

1000
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,172
...no failure to perform wifely duties,
that would push you over?

1001
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:47,443
Why do you jump right to splitting up?
Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it.

1002
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:51,013
-So life is better with Jenny than without?
-Yes, what--?

1003
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,150
Are you wearing a wire? Jen, are you--?
She's listening to this.

1004
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,153
Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.

1005
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:01,590
I mean, come on, buddy. I had
a fight with my wife. Let me just sulk.

1006
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,193
I just wanna know if you're really happy.

1007
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,662
Oh, wait, there she is.

1008
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,597
{\an8}-Where? Who?
-Give me the kid.

1009
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:12,501
No, no, no, I can't be a party to this.
That's shameless.

1010
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,670
This is gonna be even better
than the puppy.

1011
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,006
No, not my son.

1012
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,513
Marley, no. Please, please, Marley, no.
Please.

1013
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,615
Please.

1014
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,768
Marley! Marley, what are you--?

1015
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,805
Marley, God, look at this.

1016
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:27,410
Stop it. Why do you do this?
Why do you ruin everything? Go on.

1017
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,648
Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1018
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,553
John, get that dog out of here.
I want that dog out of here right now.

1019
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,356
-I'll take him for a walk.
-No, take him to that farm.

1020
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,658
All right, buddy,
we're going to the farm again.

1021
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,593
Hey, I'm serious. I'm not kidding.

1022
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,729
-I can't take this anymore.
-What did he do?

1023
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,833
Everything. What hasn't he done?
He's just a horrible, horrible animal.

1024
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,535
Well, that's a little unfair.

1025
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:55,638
No, what's unfair is that Conor
hasn't slept in two weeks...

1026
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,473
...because of that dog's barking...

1027
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,842
...that Patrick gets knocked down
twice a day...

1028
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,844
...that I can't even think straight.

1029
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,115
-And God forbid there's a hint of thunder.
-Just calm down for a second.

1030
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,851
I know it's been a rough couple of months
with the new baby.

1031
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,219
I understand that.

1032
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,089
But I was talking with Arnie,
and postpartum depression--

1033
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,590
Don't you dare.

1034
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:18,327
I am not depressed. I am exhausted.

1035
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,830
I am not angry
because of some condition.

1036
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,732
I can't even go out for an hour
without the kids...

1037
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,602
...because every babysitter
is terrified of Marley.

1038
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,205
I know, but you said
you didn't wanna work anymore.

1039
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,807
-We can get help, but you said--
-I don't need any help!

1040
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,844
-Just get rid of the dog.
-That's not gonna happen, obviously.

1041
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,513
-Please keep your voice down.
-Me keep my voice down?

1042
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,382
Just get rid of the dog.
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.

1043
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,318
-It's just a dog.
-I'm just a husband.

1044
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,620
-Gonna get rid of me?
-I've thought about it.

1045
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:48,157
-Oh, well, that makes two of us.
-What do you have to complain about?

1046
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,759
What do I--? Oh, because
you're such a joy to be around?

1047
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,294
Oh, you're such a jerk.

1048
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:55,231
Nice to walk in
and feel like you're joining a chain gang.

1049
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:56,699
Just a jerk.

1050
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,737
Stop it.

1051
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,506
It's your fault.

1052
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,907
You gotta be kidding me.

1053
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:10,212
Nope. It's just for a couple days
till things cool down at home.

1054
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,250
A couple days will be all right.

1055
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,886
You guys know each other,
so you should be okay.

1056
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,821
You want a beer?

1057
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,157
I'm all right.

1058
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,625
Are you moving?

1059
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,928
-Yeah.
-Where?

1060
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,463
New York.

1061
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:31,400
The Gray Lady came a-courting.

1062
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,370
<i>The Times</i> offered you a permanent job?

1063
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,206
Gave Arnie my notice last week.

1064
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:41,777
-You didn't even say anything.
-I know. I'm sorry, I just....

1065
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,282
It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

1066
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:49,618
That's great. <i>The New York Times.</i>

1067
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,188
It's what we always dreamed of.

1068
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,929
Well, congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

1069
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,832
-Thanks for looking after Marley.
-Yeah.

1070
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,901
He's eating your briefcase right now.

1071
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,704
-Shit.
-Marley. Marley, no.

1072
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:12,608
-Two days, John, I'm serious.
-Sorry.

1073
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,983
-Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
-I wasn't sleeping.

1074
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,787
Where's Marley?

1075
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,723
Sebastian's gonna watch him
for a few days.

1076
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,593
I'd love to see that.

1077
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,798
Just until I can find
a more permanent home.

1078
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,937
This is his permanent home, John.
Marley's not going anywhere.

1079
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,741
Honey, I'm sorry.
I just got overwhelmed.

1080
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,877
No one tells you
how hard this is all gonna be.

1081
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,746
Which part?

1082
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,282
What? All of it.

1083
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:57,019
Marriage, being a parent.

1084
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,956
It's the hardest job in the world,
and nobody prepares you for that.

1085
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,993
Nobody tells you
how much you have to give up.

1086
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,764
I feel like they do tell you,
but, I don't know, you don't listen...

1087
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,634
...or you think, "They're just miserable."

1088
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:20,342
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

1089
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:26,682
But I can't say that, because
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

1090
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,788
But I feel that, I really do.
I feel it sometimes.

1091
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,391
I just....

1092
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:39,595
-I just want you to know that.
-I do know that.

1093
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:44,433
-And you can say it. I say it.
-But I did make a choice.

1094
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,772
I made a choice,
and even if it's harder than I thought...

1095
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:51,807
...I don't regret it.

1096
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,776
-Are you sure?
-I'm very sure.

1097
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,079
Because it kind of has a
"there's no place like home" feeling to it.

1098
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:01,650
I think these things are gonna happen,
and we're gonna get through them.

1099
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:05,888
-And we'll just do it together.
-Together.

1100
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:12,761
Getting rid of Marley
is not gonna fix anything.

1101
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:13,929
No.

1102
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:18,467
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

1103
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,002
-Can I ask you a favor?
-Yes.

1104
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,771
No more kids for a while?

1105
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:26,108
Absolutely. Deal.

1106
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,516
Hi, guys.

1107
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,852
All right, say hello to Colleen.

1108
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,588
-Daddy says her name is Whoops.
-Oh, no, I....

1109
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,724
-Patrick said that.
-What?

1110
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,992
-I don't know.
-Why did you say that?

1111
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,862
I was just kidding around.
It was kind of a secret, guys.

1112
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,997
Over here.

1113
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,736
-Wait, wait. Over here.
-Oh, yeah!

1114
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,571
The old pro brings it back.

1115
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,741
He looks for a little separation,
gets an assist from Colleen.

1116
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,476
-Yeah!
-Yeah, score!

1117
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:04,446
-Nice shot, Dad.
-Come on, "Nice shot"? Come on, Conor.

1118
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,516
-Extraordinary.
-Yeah. Again.

1119
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,119
No, wait, let me get that. I'll be back.

1120
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:13,756
-All right.
-My knees are shot.

1121
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,759
Hello?

1122
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,094
Yes, it is.

1123
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,632
Yeah, yeah.

1124
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,870
Hi, how are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

1125
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,775
-Darn.
-Hey, who was that on the phone?

1126
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,743
The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i>

1127
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:38,580
I sent the editor some clips a while back,
and he wants to meet.

1128
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,048
What's a while back?

1129
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,951
He was down here on vacation
like a month ago...

1130
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,188
...and he read my stuff,
and we kind of had lunch.

1131
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,823
How do you kind of have lunch?

1132
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,859
Well, I didn't think anything
was gonna come of it.

1133
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,897
-Okay, but...?
-They offered me a job.

1134
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,666
I mean, I have, you know, an interview.

1135
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,868
As, like, a columnist or...?

1136
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,638
-As a reporter.
-As a reporter?

1137
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:03,806
Well, what did you say?

1138
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,476
I said, "Thank you very much,
but I'm happy here."

1139
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:11,180
<i>"Never have I heard someone piss
and moan as much as John Grogan.</i>

1140
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,849
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move."

1141
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,818
Part of my job is to get a response.

1142
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,220
I'm glad to see a little blood flowing
from people.

1143
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,055
No, there's a recurring theme here.

1144
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,958
The theme is that we got a lot of cranks
in Broward County.

1145
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,493
That's what I'm up against.

1146
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,963
What I'm trying to say, with all
due respect, is that you are one of them.

1147
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,498
Well, I'm a commentator.

1148
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,835
Everyone wants me to act like
everything's great when there are issues.

1149
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:36,905
There's overcrowding, there's crime,
there's racial tensions.

1150
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,642
Every time you turn around, there's
a new sky rise even uglier than the--

1151
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,246
That goes on all over the world.
It's not Florida, it's you. What's wrong?

1152
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,748
Nothing's wrong.
Everyone wants to think:

1153
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,251
"Oh, he's turning 40.
He's become a curmudgeon."

1154
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,721
That's not it. Maybe....

1155
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:56,592
I don't know. I don't know,
maybe I'm sick of my column.

1156
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:00,262
I don't find the things that I'm saying
that interesting.

1157
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,665
John, John, you're the comic voice
of South Florida.

1158
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,968
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

1159
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,603
Maybe a regional treasure.

1160
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,938
-Well, a municipal treasure for sure.
-Thank you.

1161
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,008
Listen, take a vacation.
Go away for a couple weeks.

1162
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,210
-Take a month off.
-And go where?

1163
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,947
-I don't know. Take--
-I live in a vacation spot.

1164
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:23,519
Then go someplace
where it's painful and sad.

1165
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:38,100
Forty is gonna be tough, buddy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1166
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,904
But we knew that.

1167
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,207
We knew this was when Father Time
was gonna make his move...

1168
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,710
...try to take us down a dark alley
and just beat the hell out of us.

1169
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,180
You got a little more white
around the temples...

1170
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:56,818
...but it makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

1171
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,287
We both lost a step.

1172
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,959
Well, how's it feel
to have your best years behind you?

1173
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,662
You do everything you wanted to?

1174
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:10,666
No, me neither.

1175
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:16,705
All right. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

1176
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,945
You know what?

1177
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,347
Not today.

1178
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:28,083
You've been on a leash a little too long.

1179
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,086
Go, go.

1180
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,661
You got a little bit of a second wind.

1181
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,174
Go get it.

1182
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,878
-Hey, get your dog!
-What?

1183
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,754
No, no. Please, God, no.

1184
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,891
No, no, no!

1185
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,400
Come here, come here. It's okay.

1186
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:55,437
Dude, that was not cool.

1187
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,306
Come on, girl, let's go!

1188
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,713
Great.

1189
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,184
Let's go. Let's go.

1190
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:18,927
Man, you are the world's worst dog.
You know that, right?

1191
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,463
You were top five going into the day...

1192
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,833
...and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

1193
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,735
And I take my hat off to you.

1194
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:40,048
Surprise!

1195
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,974
Dad, can I blow out--?

1196
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,376
-Happy birthday.
-Yes, you can help me.

1197
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,112
But hold on, hold on. On three.

1198
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:13,849
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1199
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,825
But don't beg, Marley.

1200
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:27,529
That's not good.
Because we don't have to.

1201
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,934
Tell me the truth. Were you surprised?

1202
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,003
Completely, yes. Thank you.

1203
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,372
-Really?
-I was. You guys got me.

1204
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,341
We got you.

1205
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,410
Are you ready for your birthday present?

1206
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,081
There's more?
I don't need any other present.

1207
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,221
-Happy birthday.
-What was that?

1208
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:57,359
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

1209
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,562
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

1210
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,566
Well, then any other job.
We'll follow you wherever you wanna go.

1211
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,903
I understand, but I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna uproot us.

1212
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,272
We've got our friends,
the kids enjoy school...

1213
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,140
...and I've got my poker game.

1214
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,443
-I couldn't possibly.
-First of all, it's just an interview.

1215
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,045
You don't have the job yet.

1216
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:20,315
And second of all,
honey, you don't have any friends.

1217
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:23,552
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

1218
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:25,153
I hired them.

1219
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:28,557
What I'm trying to say is that our life
is here, and I'm okay with that.

1220
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,425
Our life is wherever we are.

1221
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,595
-That's it. And you're not happy here.
-That's not true.

1222
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,998
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless. I can feel it.

1223
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,166
I'm not.

1224
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,203
I feel it every day
that you read Sebastian's articles.

1225
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,339
I feel it every time you sit
an extra five minutes in your car...

1226
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:45,540
...before you come in.

1227
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,008
-I don't do that.
-You do.

1228
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:51,179
-I'm checking things in the car, I'm not--
-I just think it's time for a change.

1229
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,348
I'm 40, Jen.

1230
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:56,918
Maybe at 39, but I'm too-- I don't know.

1231
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,221
It feels a little late
to be making big changes.

1232
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,223
No, no, no.

1233
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,191
What are you doing?

1234
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,061
We're not old, John.

1235
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,366
We can still surprise ourselves.

1236
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,607
See, most girls would do a swan dive...

1237
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,476
...but you know
that a cannonball is so much sexier.

1238
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,482
So are you ready
for your other birthday present or what?

1239
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,517
Yes.

1240
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:33,955
This is like an embarrassment of riches,
this birthday.

1241
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,524
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

1242
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,002
See? We're not old.

1243
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,112
Grogan.

1244
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:09,157
-Just wanna wish you good luck up there.
-Thanks. Yeah.

1245
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,027
It'll be good. I'm gonna miss everybody.

1246
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,229
-I'm gonna miss your laugh.
-Yeah.

1247
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:18,266
There's a good chance that every piece
of advice I gave you was a lot of crap.

1248
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,636
Oh, no, no. I appreciate it just the same.

1249
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:25,674
Well, at this point, a mushy guy
would tell you he was proud of you...

1250
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,576
...give you a hug,
and send you on your way.

1251
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:33,048
Well, I'm glad you're not that guy, sir.

1252
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,317
All right.

1253
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,619
Okay. Thanks.

1254
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:41,556
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

1255
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,326
That's my specialty.

1256
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,615
-Are we here yet?
-No.

1257
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,352
-Now?
-We got a couple hours to go.

1258
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,354
-Now?
-Soak it up.

1259
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,489
-Now?
-We must be near it.

1260
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,025
Are we getting hot or cold?

1261
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,362
-Why are we turning in here?
-We're living here.

1262
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:24,332
I want a moment of silence
just to take this in, okay?

1263
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:28,603
Before the pandemonium. Look at this.

1264
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:32,674
-Here we go.
-Come on, we're here.

1265
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,349
Marley. Marley, no.

1266
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:43,785
Marley, Marley, Marley, no, no.
Marley, no.

1267
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,254
And we're home.

1268
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,364
Hey, Andy Rooney. If you're knocking off,
I'll walk with you to the train.

1269
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:00,235
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

1270
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,537
Mark Twain said
not to use exclamation points...

1271
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,773
...because it's like laughing
at your own joke.

1272
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,809
Sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke because it's funny.

1273
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,179
-It's here, it's here, it's here!
-Mom, get up, get up, get up.

1274
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:14,449
-Where? Where? Where?
-Over here.

1275
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:18,753
Come on, come on, come on.
It's here, it's here.

1276
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,423
Come on, Dad. Look, Daddy.
Come on, come on, come on.

1277
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,158
Whoa, Daddy.

1278
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:45,280
Okay, look at me. Guys, guys, guys.

1279
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:50,585
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

1280
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:53,555
Yeah. Now, that one's coming.
Now you can really see it.

1281
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:55,356
Guys, lunch is ready.

1282
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,126
-Okay. Heading in.
-Take that.

1283
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,295
-I'll get you.
-Let's go. Marley!

1284
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,231
-Come on, guys.
-Marley, come on. Marley.

1285
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:06,501
No, no, you know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

1286
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,574
Thank you.

1287
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,295
What are you doing in here?

1288
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,365
You're going for the bunk bed tonight?

1289
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:42,504
Pretty good day.
I mean, the snow? Come on.

1290
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,373
All right. Sleep tight.

1291
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,782
-Too much color?
-Yeah.

1292
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,354
Don't get me wrong, it's a good piece.
But you're reporting now, John.

1293
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,524
I want you to tell the story,
I don't want you to be in the story.

1294
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,826
I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself
in there.

1295
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,695
The point is, I still feel you in there.

1296
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,732
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

1297
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,868
Got it.

1298
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,573
-Door's always open.
-Thanks.

1299
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,275
Hut.

1300
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,547
He's coming, he's coming.

1301
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:31,286
Here comes the old pro.
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

1302
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:35,623
Yeah. Oh, yes. He catches it.

1303
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,525
Then he fends off one guy.

1304
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,762
He's running through there.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

1305
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:44,699
They can't get him,
because he's got too much--

1306
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:49,671
And Grogan goes down.
Down goes Grogan.

1307
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,706
-You're home early.
-That's right.

1308
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:56,411
I had to come home and teach these kids
how to play football the right way.

1309
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,313
Okay.

1310
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,815
-Guys, seriously, dinner's in an hour.
-Okay.

1311
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,850
And I want you
to finish your homework...

1312
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,286
...and take off those shoes
before you come in.

1313
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,455
Yeah, take off your shoes.

1314
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:10,858
Ground and pound, ground and pound,
ground and pound.

1315
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,332
My God.

1316
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:20,868
I come home and it's like I got mugged.

1317
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,837
Okay.

1318
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,874
Come on.

1319
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,610
What's wrong with him, Dad?

1320
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,347
Nothing's wrong. He's just tired.
Right, Dad?

1321
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,883
Yeah.
I think the football took it out of him.

1322
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,820
Let's go.

1323
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,623
I don't know, I just don't understand.

1324
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,859
A year ago, you couldn't wait to be done
with your column.

1325
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:47,362
I know, but now I got this guy...

1326
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:50,331
...going through every sentence
with a fine-toothed comb...

1327
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,368
...and I gotta admit, I miss the freedom,
where I could just--

1328
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:54,702
What?

1329
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:57,705
It's just--
It's exhausting sometimes, John.

1330
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,576
You always wanting something
that you don't have.

1331
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:03,745
Are you happy?

1332
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:08,549
-I mean, none of this was part of the plan.
-No.

1333
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,618
No, it wasn't part of the plan.

1334
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,521
But it's so much better.

1335
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:17,325
You know?
I'm just sort of done making plans.

1336
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,895
Marley. Oh, gross.

1337
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:23,631
Seems like somebody needs to go out.

1338
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,601
All right. Marley.

1339
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:29,404
Come on. Come on, boy.

1340
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,341
Oh, come on.

1341
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:36,611
Now it's really coming down.

1342
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,850
Marley?

1343
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,620
Marley!

1344
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,822
Where did he go? Marley!

1345
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:50,591
What's going on?

1346
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,928
I don't know, he's just--
He's not coming back.

1347
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:57,899
-Marley!
-Well, he couldn't have gone far.

1348
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,936
-Marley!
-I'll come with you. Hold on.

1349
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:07,108
Marley!
I don't know where he could've gone.

1350
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,911
Maybe he went next door again
in the barn.

1351
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:13,848
-Well, we can check in the woodshed.
-Okay.

1352
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,617
Marley!

1353
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,624
Marley?

1354
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:26,527
Marley.

1355
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:28,596
Where the...?

1356
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:33,401
-Do you see anything?
-No, nothing.

1357
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:41,576
-I gotta go talk to them.
-Okay.

1358
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,880
Oh, wow, it's pouring out there.

1359
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:47,415
Did you find him?

1360
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:51,786
You know what? He's out exploring.

1361
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:53,755
You know how he loves the woods.

1362
01:29:56,891 --> 01:30:00,094
Bobby says dogs,
when they're gonna die...

1363
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,996
...they go away to do it.

1364
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,631
That's what his beagle did.

1365
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:07,502
Well, you know what,
that's true for beagles...

1366
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:10,705
...but not Labs like Marley.

1367
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:14,175
He's just out causing trouble.
Don't worry.

1368
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:16,911
Okay, now,
you finished with your homework?

1369
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,179
-Yep.
-Nope.

1370
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:23,084
Nope? Well, let's make that a "yep."
Come on, now.

1371
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:30,558
Marley!

1372
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,660
Marley!

1373
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,466
Marley!

1374
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,505
Marley.

1375
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:47,475
Marley.

1376
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,011
Marley, are you okay?

1377
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:55,750
Just stay there.

1378
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:01,923
Why did his stomach twist?
We don't exactly know why this happens.

1379
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,759
Most likely,
he ate or drank something quickly...

1380
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,561
...and his stomach just flipped.

1381
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,831
I did manage to get a tube down there
to relieve some of the gas.

1382
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,501
-I think I untwisted it.
-He seems okay.

1383
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,470
For now he's good.

1384
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:20,041
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

1385
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:23,578
And if it does, I don't know
what I'm gonna be able to do for him.

1386
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:25,112
He's an older dog.

1387
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:28,082
I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

1388
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:31,052
Well, we have to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

1389
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:32,987
Most likely, it is gonna happen again.

1390
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,857
Well, you also talked about
that maybe he ate too fast...

1391
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,992
...or drank, you know, too quickly...

1392
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,928
...and so maybe
it doesn't have to happen again.

1393
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,263
We'll monitor that.

1394
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,700
I'm just saying
you may wanna prepare yourself...

1395
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,236
...that he may not make it
through the night.

1396
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:53,875
Maybe 10 percent of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1397
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,245
What is that number based on?

1398
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,213
What is it based on?

1399
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:03,751
Yeah, the reason why I ask is, I bet
that number is based on regular dogs.

1400
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:04,886
Regular dogs?

1401
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:07,855
Yeah, and this guy here
is not like other dogs.

1402
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:09,790
I know people say that all the time...

1403
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:12,894
...but to be honest,
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1404
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:16,097
He once ate an answering machine,
just polished it off.

1405
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,766
He didn't chew it,
he ate it and then digested it...

1406
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,735
...and then had the phone for dessert.

1407
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,872
Another time, my son had colic,
and this guy sat up all night, didn't move.

1408
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:28,276
Just stayed right there for nine hours,
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1409
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:32,980
So I think maybe that the, you know,
the number applies to regular dogs...

1410
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:34,148
...but not to him.

1411
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,918
Well, you've got a fighter here.

1412
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,586
Let's hope for the best.

1413
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:43,224
Oh, I know he's gonna be okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

1414
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,814
-Oh, hi.
-Hey.

1415
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:11,986
They're gonna keep him overnight,
but he seemed better when I left.

1416
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:15,823
And the vet really seemed on top of it.

1417
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,961
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

1418
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:24,231
-What are you reading?
-I'm reading your old columns.

1419
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,236
Marley's in so many of them.

1420
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,372
You still look at those?

1421
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:34,175
Yeah, I do sometimes.

1422
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:38,379
Even on the crappiest days...

1423
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:43,851
...when the kids are driving me nuts,
the laundry's not done...

1424
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,721
...and a hundred other things
are wrong...

1425
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:49,690
...I always know that I have this.

1426
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:53,661
It's five minutes of you.

1427
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,964
Sometimes they're sad...

1428
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,868
...and sometimes they're really funny,
silly or whatever...

1429
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:04,105
...but they're all you.

1430
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:08,209
And for those five minutes...

1431
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,678
...you make me feel better.

1432
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:27,762
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

1433
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:31,432
Might even make a nice book.

1434
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:34,435
-A book?
-Something.

1435
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,986
Hello?

1436
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,890
All right.

1437
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,725
Thank you.

1438
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,062
He's coming home.

1439
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,474
Is he there?

1440
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:17,178
Of course he's there. He's always there.

1441
01:35:17,311 --> 01:35:19,713
How does he know when we're coming?

1442
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:22,016
I don't know. He just knows.

1443
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:24,085
Dogs know stuff like that.

1444
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:27,088
-All dogs?
-All good dogs.

1445
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:30,891
-Look, there he is. There he is, Marley.
-Yeah.

1446
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:37,898
Hi, Marley.

1447
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,767
-Marley.
-How you doing, Marley?

1448
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,870
-I missed you at school.
-Hey, I'll race you to the house.

1449
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:44,905
-Okay.
-Go.

1450
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,782
-Eagles?
-Yeah, the Eagles are going all the way.

1451
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:56,317
-I don't know.
-I guarantee you.

1452
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,219
-What are you, a Dolphins fan?
-No.

1453
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:00,955
-John Grogan.
-Hey.

1454
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,756
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

1455
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,127
I said to myself, "That sorry son of a bitch
looks like John Grogan."

1456
01:36:07,128 --> 01:36:09,063
-What are you doing here?
-A story.

1457
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:11,398
DEA's showing off the new field office.
I'm cov--

1458
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:14,268
You know what? Doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

1459
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:17,004
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah.

1460
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:20,107
-You living in the city somewhere?
-I live just outside of town.

1461
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,408
More space for the kids.

1462
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:24,145
-Oh, what do you got, like five now?
-Three. Here.

1463
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:27,248
I'll show you a little snapshot
of the Grogan brood.

1464
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:33,154
-Wow, Jen's holding up.
-Yeah, thanks. I think.

1465
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:36,190
I see you finally got a little girl, huh?

1466
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:40,394
-Colleen. She arrived after you left.
-What's with the ladybug getup?

1467
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:43,063
That was for her school play
in preschool...

1468
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:46,800
...and then we couldn't get her out
of her costume for a month afterwards.

1469
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:49,870
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

1470
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:52,439
...is because of the antennas on--
He went ballistic.

1471
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:55,843
-Things don't change.
-That's right.

1472
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:01,048
I wish I didn't have this interview.

1473
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:04,218
That's okay, I gotta get home. I got--
Conor's got a soccer game.

1474
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:07,021
All right, well, one of these days
we've gotta catch up.

1475
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:10,024
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

1476
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:13,928
-Well, it was good to see you.
-Come here. Good to see you.

1477
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:16,597
-Give Jenny my best, okay?
-All right. I will. Okay.

1478
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:18,199
-Here.
-Oh, yeah.

1479
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:22,336
Here. That's a great picture, John.

1480
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:23,871
You did okay.

1481
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:27,575
Thanks. You did okay too.

1482
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,610
-I'll see you.
-I'll see you.

1483
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:33,881
-I think you'll like the next one better.
-Good.

1484
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:38,085
Don't do it to yourself. We're in Philly.
Let's get a cheese steak. Hi.

1485
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,220
-Hi.
-Sebastian.

1486
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,487
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1487
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:42,489
Nice to meet you.

1488
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:47,628
Hello?

1489
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:54,969
Is anybody home?

1490
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:03,344
Marley, hey. Marley, Marley, Marley.

1491
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,614
Hey, hey. Marley. Marley.

1492
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:11,385
Marley. You didn't hear me, did you?

1493
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:15,289
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

1494
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:19,393
All right, let's go for a walk.
Come on, let's go.

1495
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:36,510
Come on. Come on.
You're almost to the top.

1496
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:39,079
You know what? Come here.

1497
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:41,482
This is a good spot right here.

1498
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:54,295
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, all right?

1499
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:56,497
You know, when it's time.

1500
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:01,101
I don't wanna make that decision
on my own.

1501
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,438
You let me know when you're ready,
okay?

1502
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:12,112
All right.

1503
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:22,723
Marley?

1504
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:26,260
There he is.

1505
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:28,996
Marley.

1506
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:32,966
Hi. Honey,
what are you doing down here?

1507
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:37,137
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

1508
01:39:37,271 --> 01:39:39,206
Come on.

1509
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:41,275
Can you make it upstairs?

1510
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,747
I think he's pretty comfortable
down here.

1511
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:51,352
-I'll get him a blanket.
-You all right?

1512
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:59,426
I'm gonna lay down here for a second.

1513
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,463
Take a load off.

1514
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:09,169
Yeah. It's actually nice down here.

1515
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:11,338
This might be better.

1516
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,710
Well, it would be twice a week,
600 words.

1517
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:18,112
And what's the subject?

1518
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:21,281
You know, everyday stuff.
The stuff we all go through, but funnier.

1519
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,118
I don't get it.
I thought you came here to be a reporter.

1520
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,353
I know, I did,
but we both know that isn't me.

1521
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:28,522
I'm a columnist, a good one,
and I think--

1522
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:31,525
Excuse me, John?
Your wife's on the phone. It's important.

1523
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,260
Okay, I'll be right there.

1524
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:36,730
Think about it? Possible?

1525
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:38,599
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1526
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:41,668
-Hello?
-I can't get him to come back inside.

1527
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:46,540
He's just laying out there in the cold,
and he won't move.

1528
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,622
-Hey.
-Hi.

1529
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,824
Patrick came home and we got him here.

1530
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:09,296
Dr. Platt said that if he's comfortable,
leave him for a while and see.

1531
01:41:10,063 --> 01:41:12,633
But he's just not getting better.

1532
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:18,138
All right. I'm gonna take him in.

1533
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,709
-Is he sick again?
-Yeah, he is, honey.

1534
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:24,678
He doesn't feel too good.

1535
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:28,582
But I'm gonna take him to the doctor.
They're gonna try to make him feel better.

1536
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:31,452
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

1537
01:41:36,156 --> 01:41:40,861
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

1538
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,564
That's sweet, honey.

1539
01:41:43,697 --> 01:41:45,632
Here, I'll take it.

1540
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:50,871
Bye.

1541
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,350
Okay.

1542
01:42:59,907 --> 01:43:02,543
I've tried everything I did last time
that worked...

1543
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:04,945
...but I'm not having any luck.

1544
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:09,316
I'm not able to get the tube down there.
The stomach is still twisted.

1545
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:13,620
-There's still surgery, but--
-He's not strong enough.

1546
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:25,966
-I like this one the best.
-Which one?

1547
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:29,970
Oh, the mangoes. Yeah.

1548
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,774
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, it's me.</i>

1549
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:37,311
So it's his stomach again.

1550
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:40,747
And they could do surgery, but....

1551
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,716
I know.

1552
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:46,653
Do you want me to come down there?

1553
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:51,858
No, I think it's a good idea to stay with
the kids and, you know, be with them.

1554
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:53,961
And I'm just gonna....

1555
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,572
I love you, John.

1556
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,742
I love you.

1557
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,382
Hi.

1558
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,250
-I'm gonna give you some time.
-Okay.

1559
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:20,654
-I'll be right outside if you need me.
-All right. Thanks.

1560
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,525
Look what I got for you.

1561
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:27,361
Remember this?

1562
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:32,799
Look what Colleen sent you.
You remember that?

1563
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:36,837
You remember chewing up that ear? No.

1564
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:40,507
It's tough to remember all the things
you've chewed up, isn't it?

1565
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:43,377
It all starts to kind of run together.

1566
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:21,081
It's okay. You don't have to do anything.

1567
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:25,419
You don't have your usual energy.

1568
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:29,589
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are?

1569
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:32,659
That you're the world's worst dog?

1570
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,962
Don't believe it.

1571
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,765
Don't believe it even for a minute...

1572
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:42,369
...because you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

1573
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,974
You know,
what made you such a great dog...

1574
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:51,912
...is that you loved us every day,
no matter what.

1575
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:54,081
That's an amazing thing.

1576
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:57,384
You know how much we love you?

1577
01:45:57,517 --> 01:45:59,853
We love you so much.

1578
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:06,059
We love you more than anything.

1579
01:46:07,594 --> 01:46:12,733
I don't know exactly where we go
from here...

1580
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:16,570
...but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

1581
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:19,706
You're a great dog.

1582
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:33,820
<i>He won't feel this. He'll just slip away.</i>

1583
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:36,022
You ready?

1584
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:40,627
-Yeah, we're ready.
-Okay.

1585
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:48,255
Okay. Get down.

1586
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:56,763
-He's wrapped in his blanket.
-Yeah, so he can stay warm.

1587
01:48:57,764 --> 01:48:59,866
Do you guys
wanna read what you wrote?

1588
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:06,539
Mine's a picture of me and Marley,
grasshoppers and ice cream.

1589
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:08,608
Mommy wrote what I said.

1590
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:13,980
"Dear Marley,
I will never forget you forever. Colleen."

1591
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:16,850
And these are kisses.

1592
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:19,219
-That's beautiful.
-Thank you.

1593
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:24,324
You wanna put it in? He'll like that.
Set it down.

1594
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:30,230
Good. That's a great picture.

1595
01:49:30,563 --> 01:49:32,065
Conor, do you wanna...?

1596
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:38,271
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.

1597
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:41,775
I hope you like heaven
and that there's lots to chew on.

1598
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:45,211
Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan."

1599
01:49:48,848 --> 01:49:50,951
That's a good letter.

1600
01:49:51,785 --> 01:49:55,355
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

1601
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:59,059
He knows.

1602
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:04,965
I'd like to give him something.

1603
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,106
This necklace.

1604
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:17,110
It's been on quite a journey.

1605
01:50:23,984 --> 01:50:26,252
Your dad gave it to me...

1606
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:30,890
...to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1607
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:32,826
But, you know...

1608
01:50:34,027 --> 01:50:36,863
...our family had really already begun.

1609
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:45,739
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

1610
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:15,168
<i>A dog has no use for fancy cars...</i>

1611
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:18,204
<i>...or big homes or designer clothes.</i>

1612
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:21,908
<i>A waterlogged stick will do just fine.</i>

<i>Give him your heart

1616
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:40,326
<i>How many people
can you say that about?</i>

1617

<i>How many people can make you feel rare
and pure and special?</i>
