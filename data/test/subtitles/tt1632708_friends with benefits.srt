1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,650
Okay. Let's see where we are.

2
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,055
We could move this, get rid of that, kill that.

3
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,593
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her.
We can get rid of that.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,195
That's done. Okay, we could start with this.

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,332
I know it's a hard-hitting piece,
but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

6
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,667
We need traffic, traffic, traffic.
What do you got?

7
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,404
-How about this?
-It's perfect.

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,040
Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

9
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,808
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

10
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,344
I'm fucking with you people.
This isn't a porn site.

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,179
What are we, nerds trying to look at boobies?

12
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,081
Come on, keep looking.

13
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,450
Shit! Hello?

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,153
Hey! Baby, where are you?
Are you still at work?

15
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,454
No! Not even close.

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,122
Just so you know,
the movie starts in 10 minutes.

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,824
-I know! Give me your pants.
-What?

18
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,626
-I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on.
-No.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,594
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.

20
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,197
Please try not to be late.
I really hate missing the beginning.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,432
I know. I know.

22
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,835
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.

23
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,837
I'm almost there!

24
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,440
-How far away?
-I think I see you!

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,210
-Where are you? I'm here.
-So am I.

26
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,112
So many people. What are you wearing?

27
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,548
I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theater,

28
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,451
because I'm the only person
outside the theater!

29
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,586
I love that outfit. You look so sexy in that.

30
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,288
You know that I love this movie.

31
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,192
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman
can fall in love,

32
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,093
then anyone can.

33
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,296
I know this means a lot to you,
which means it means a lot to me.

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,697
Well, apparently it doesn't.

35
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,265
I'm looking at you right now. I can see you!

36
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,600
Jamie!

37
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,402
Hey!

38
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,604
-Hey.
-You made it.

39
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,506
-Yeah. Hey.
-Hi.

40
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,175
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

41
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,544
I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

42
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,613
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

43
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,882
Yes, I'm fully aware of your allergies.

44
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,886
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.

45
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,721
We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.

46
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,756
Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

47
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,358
It was fucking Your Body Is a Wonderland!

48
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,362
Well, the good news is,
he has so many good ones.

49
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,166
Here's an idea: next time,
instead of being late, just shit on my face.

50
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,768
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing Your Body Is a Wonderland.

51
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,170
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.

52
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,439
Julia Roberts is about to put on
her really tall boots.

53
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,542
We need to talk.

54
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,747
I think we should take a break.

55
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,283
I just feel like
we should chill for a while, you know?

56
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,185
-You're doing this?
-You're breaking up with me?

57
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,553
You said I was your soul mate.

58
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,787
I did? When?

59
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,457
When we were at that bed and breakfast
having sex.

60
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,159
-But, you know, that doesn't...
-That doesn't what?

61
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,395
-Count.
-I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

62
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,697
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

63
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,167
and a little more
about the girl that you're dating.

64
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,537
'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

65
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,206
that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

66
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,942
I never said "go up." Okay?

67
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,546
I just said lightly around...
It's like a little button.

68
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,548
You know what? Not your issue anymore.

69
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,749
Is this why you were late?

70
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,417
You were worried
about how to break up with me?

71
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,819
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to decide what to wear.

72
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,289
-So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie.
-Yeah.

73
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,957
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

74
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,859
Don't lash out, okay?

75
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,694
-You're better than that.
-I'm really not.

76
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,529
I just think
we're heading in different directions.

77
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,965
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert
and me not.

78
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,568
Thank you for doing this
before the concert, by the way.

79
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,636
Best breakup ever.

80
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,838
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!

81
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,340
Let me just ask you a quick question.

82
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:31,444
And just know that I am not at all
crushed by this breakup.

83
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,413
So, be honest. Why?

84
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,714
-Wait, is this a trick?
-No.

85
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,716
Just pure anthropological research.

86
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,751
Okay. You want someone
to sweep you off your feet,

87
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,654
but you're more interested
in getting swept off your feet

88
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,922
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.

89
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,325
You seem like you've got it totally together,

90
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,293
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

91
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,730
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes...

92
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,899
Thank you. That's enough.

93
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,534
It is not you at all.

94
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,737
Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

95
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,607
It's not. It's me. I don't like you anymore.

96
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,009
This is my fault. You deserve better than me.

97
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,477
You're a great guy.

98
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,814
A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

99
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,915
I didn't.

100
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,383
I really want to stay friends.

101
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,884
-Let's stay friends.
-Sure.

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,286
Totally.

103
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,389
John Mayer.

104
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,658
John fucking Mayer!

105
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,627
Come here, you.

106
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,363
You're gonna get through this.

107
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:30,470
Why do relationships always start off so fun
and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

108
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,774
I really have to stop buying into this bullshit
Hollywood cliché of true love.

109
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,645
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!

110
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,914
I'm just gonna work and fuck.
Like George Clooney.

111
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,784
I'm just gonna
shut myself down emotionally.

112
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,054
Like George Clooney.

113
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,698
Hello.

114
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,400
Seat up, please, sir.

115
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,068
Is that the Hudson River?

116
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,971
No. It's the East River.

117
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,075
So we won't be landing on it, then,
like that flight,

118
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,478
you know, with that captain
they keep giving medals to?

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,014
That pilot was a hero.

120
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,685
Asshole.

121
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,954
Plane actually did a lot of the work.

122
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,958
I think I found the perfect guy
to fill that job at GQ.

123
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,428
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.

124
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,631
No, he's not sold on the job yet,
but I'll get him there. I always do.

125
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.

126
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,736
He's from LA.
I figured he's into all that bullshit.

127
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,038
Hey, sir, what's that tall building over there?

128
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,940
Empire State Building.

129
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,575
No, no, no, no. No. The other one.

130
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,512
The really, really tall one
with the antenna on top of it, the windows.

131
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,014
That is Empire State Building.

132
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,717
Oh, yeah. You're right. King Kong.

133
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,884
Hey...

134
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,092
Oh, hey! Are you done with this? All met up?

135
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,861
Great. Welcome to New York,
Ms. Penderghast.

136
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,496
Yeah.

137
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,376
Oh, no. Excuse me. Sorry.

138
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,611
Okay.

139
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,884
-Can you hand me my bag?
-Sure. Which one?

140
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,052
-The one with the straps.
-Okay.

141
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,420
There.

142
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,021
Okay.

143
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,158
-Thank you.
-Welcome to New York, sir.

144
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,663
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

145
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,500
That's me.
Which one, the blue or the yellow?

146
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,636
No. The makeshift sign made out of lipstick,
that's me.

147
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,072
-You're Dylan Harper.
-I am.

148
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,573
I'm Jamie Rellis.

149
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,443
-You're picking me up from the airport.
-Hi. Yes, I am.

150
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,712
You always pick people up like this?

151
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,714
Yeah, you know,
I like to keep things interesting.

152
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,415
-Welcome to New York.
-Thank you.

153
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,952
You're not exactly what comes to mind
when you think headhunter.

154
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,189
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter."
Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

155
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,925
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

156
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,727
Here, here, here, I'll take it.

157
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,696
You're really gonna carry my bag?
You're that girl?

158
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,866
No. I'm gonna change your life. I'm that girl.

159
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,102
My life is already pretty great.

160
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,672
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

161
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,508
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

162
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,545
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

163
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,714
Yeah, a lot of people
would say longer than that.

164
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,683
It's a huge opportunity, Dylan.

165
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,753
Art director of GQ magazine.
This is the big leagues.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,955
I mean, no offense to your little blog
on the Internet.

167
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,990
Which got six million hits last month.

168
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,027
I could put up a video of me mixing
cake batter with my boobs

169
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,695
and it will get eight million hits.

170
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,832
It's been done. Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.

171
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,233
Really?

172
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,770
Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

173
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,705
but this is GQ.

174
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,640
New York's so crowded.

175
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,710
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

176
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,913
-I like my open spaces.
-What are you, a gazelle?

177
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,149
Come on,
what's really worrying you about this?

178
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,222
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy
who took something legendary

179
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,124
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

180
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,161
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

181
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,498
Be the guy
who made the bed legendary again.

182
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,768
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

183
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm sorry, not coffee.
Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.

184
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,042
Really hot in New York.

185
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,711
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

186
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,679
Yeah, it gets hot in LA, but it's the humidity.

187
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,616
In LA, if it's 90 degrees,
it feels like 90 degrees. But...

188
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,050
-Right.
-If it's hot in New York,

189
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,986
it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees.

190
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,188
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

191
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,090
but lucky for me, we are here.

192
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,692
So, good luck.

193
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,197
Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

194
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,600
Just do me a favor?
Act like you do so that I look good.

195
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,903
-I can do that.
-Okay. Go get 'em.

196
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,304
This is great, by the way.

197
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,582
Watch it!

198
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
-Hey!
-You're still here?

199
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,664
Yeah. Well, it's my job.

200
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,798
Nice.

201
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,334
So, tell me, how'd it go?

202
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,270
They bought it.
You're safe for a little while longer.

203
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,806
Well, thank you. I owe you one.

204
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,111
This is from you.

205
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,680
It's your offer.

206
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,215
-Wait, I got it?
-They called about five minutes ago.

207
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,353
Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.

208
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,222
Why didn't you just tell me
instead of texting me?

209
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,824
'Cause it's more dramatic.

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,095
Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed.

211
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,698
I've seen your work. It's amazing.

212
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,600
It's a huge move.

213
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,835
Would you uproot your entire life for a job?
Be honest.

214
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,104
Well, no. For a job, probably not.

215
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,108
But for New York? Yeah, I would.

216
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,377
Which is why I'm not gonna
try to sell you on the job,

217
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,912
I'm gonna sell you on New York.

218
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,246
It's New York!

219
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,748
I've seen Seinfeld.

220
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,917
Not the bullshit tourist version.

221
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,054
Puppy dog eyes. Nice touch.

222
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,723
Yes! Come on.

223
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,124
Let me buy you a drink.

224
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,762
What's wrong?

225
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,764
What are you waiting for?

226
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,932
The light to change.

227
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,734
You LA folk are so cute.

228
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,068
Come on.

229
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,203
Come on, it's fine.

230
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,304
-See?
-Yep.

231
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm gonna die.

232
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,743
Here we have Brooklyn Bridge,
downtown Manhattan,

233
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,013
and right in front of us, an outdoor bar.

234
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,783
Alcohol. Now we're talking.

235
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,287
You know, I like you.

236
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,189
I'll give you your choice of closes.

237
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,660
-What?
-How I close you on this job.

238
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,195
-Okay.
-So we got the flattery close.

239
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,932
Dylan, you are so good at what you do.

240
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,300
The take-it-or-leave-it close.

241
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,303
Man, I don't care if you take it.
I get paid regardless.

242
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,972
The sympathy close.

243
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,373
You see, my kidneys are failing...

244
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,076
Why do women think the only way
to get a man to do what they want

245
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,310
is to manipulate him?

246
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,314
History. Personal experience.
Romantic comedies.

247
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,785
Come on, you're here for a reason,
whether you want to admit it or not.

248
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,988
Yeah, to explore an option.
Who wouldn't want to know their options?

249
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,456
Someone who's in the perfect situation.

250
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,891
Are you in the perfect situation?

251
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,060
Job? Absolutely.

252
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,328
Everything else? None of your business.

253
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,767
Shaun!

254
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,035
-Jamie!
-Hey!

255
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,837
-Hey, what's up, baby?
-What are you doing here?

256
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,971
-Shaun White?
-You look great.

257
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,207
-You been working out?
-Nope. Just been eating a lot.

258
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,475
-Okay.
-Yeah.

259
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,843
-You want a drink?
-Yeah!

260
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,078
-Let me get you a drink. Yeah?
-Okay.

261
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,447
-Careful! Careful.
-Sorry.

262
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,716
Hey, bro, that was like
a double McTwist 1260.

263
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,487
-Yeah, like the trick.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dylan.

264
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,222
Jamie, you want to get this guy
out of my face

265
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,824
before I break his fucking skull?

266
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,960
Sorry, bro. No disrespect. I'm a huge fan.

267
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,363
You don't fucking know me, man!
Don't talk to me like you know me!

268
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,233
What, you think I'm all chill
'cause I snowboard and shit?

269
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,969
One more word,
I'll fuck you up like dynamite!

270
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,871
Dynamite?

271
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm just playing, bro.

272
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,843
Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.

273
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,212
-It's all good, man.
-All good.

274
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,981
I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.

275
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,783
I'll see you later.

276
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,951
-Good to see you.
-Bye, honey.

277
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,022
Shaun White seems really great. Nice dude.

278
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,992
-How do you know him again?
-I took his virginity.

279
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,428
So you guys have known
each other for a while?

280
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,130
No, it was like eight months ago.

281
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,031
Wow.

282
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,300
So does the carpet match the drapes?

283
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,137
It's hardwood floors,
if you know what I mean.

284
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,339
My God! Terrible visual.

285
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,142
Totally kidding, by the way.
Just an old friend of mine.

286
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,278
You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.

287
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,480
His hair had nice body.

288
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,516
Can I get two gyro number sixes,
extra sauce?

289
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,186
-What are you looking for?
-The cops.

290
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,888
-Come on.
-The cops?

291
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,156
Yep.

292
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,158
Come on!

293
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,029
-Where are you taking me?
-You'll see.

294
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,978
Well, here's your open space.

295
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,447
Run, gazelle. Run!

296
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,321
-Wow. This is unbelievable.
-I know.

297
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,927
Okay, this was not on Seinfeld.

298
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,063
Come on,
what's your dad think about all this?

299
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,500
About what?

300
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,868
Well, he must have an opinion.

301
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,037
He used to write for the LA Times
for 23 years.

302
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,439
Somebody did their homework.

303
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,910
I have this thing at work. It's called Google.

304
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,112
Come on, what's he think about the job?

305
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,315
Actually, I didn't ask him.

306
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,350
Well, then you must know what he'd say.

307
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,459
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that
he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.

308
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,096
Sounds like a really great man.

309
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,233
Yeah, he is.

310
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,069
Hey, do you want to
see something really cool?

311
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,538
I always want to see something really cool.
What...

312
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,139
Come on.

313
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,642
Okay.

314
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,380
Only place in the city
you can actually see the stars.

315
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,515
-Wow.
-Yeah.

316
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,985
-It's pretty awesome.
-I know.

317
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,254
I like to come up here to think.

318
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,257
Just when it gets a little too much
for me down there, it's like...

319
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,559
It's like my New York version
of a mountaintop.

320
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,296
Best part, no cell reception.

321
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,034
You take all your recruits up here?

322
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,405
Actually, never really taken anyone up here.

323
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,540
-Really?
-Yeah.

324
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,209
Thanks.

325
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,478
If you tell anyone about this,
I will rip your ears off

326
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,380
and staple them to your neck.

327
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,317
Everyone in this city seems really violent.

328
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,021
Come on, let's go. One last stop.

329
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,556
-We're just getting comfortable.
-I know you are. Come on, buddy.

330
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,159
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.

331
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,929
-Come on, come on.
-You're showing me Times Square.

332
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,298
-This is not touristy at all!
-Would you shush? Come on.

333
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,633
Do we have to power-walk
everywhere we go?

334
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,168
Yes.

335
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,072
So everybody just kind of walks
wherever they want, then.

336
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,207
How 'bout right here?

337
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,943
-What do you mean?
-We're here.

338
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,317
Oh, my God, it's 1988.

339
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,585
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.

340
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
-What is this?
-It's a flash mob.

341
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,449
-Like on Oprah!
-Exactly.

342
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,184
Should we get out of the way?

343
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,386
No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.

344
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,391
-It's pretty damn cool.
-Right?

345
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,496
It's kind of rad.

346
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,499
Do these people get paid for this?

347
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,403
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.

348
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,306
It's nice to feel
like you're a part of something.

349
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,375
New York can be a little bit lonely at times.

350
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,210
And you're trying to sell me on it.

351
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,513
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.

352
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,786
-Be careful!
-Oh, my God.

353
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,654
-Come down.
-Okay.

354
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,531
-Shit. Get back down.
-Okay.

355
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,110
-I'm in.
-What?

356
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,479
-You sold me.
-Really?

357
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,281
-I'll take the job.
-Oh, my God!

358
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:34,053
-What, are you surprised?
-No! No. Oh, you are gonna crush it!

359
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,688
Amazing.

360
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,392
-You can all go home now! Thank you!
-Very funny.

361
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,560
Come on.

362
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,396
Congratulations, sell-out!

363
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,831
Thank you, thank you.

364
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,300
All I'm saying is,
it wasn't so much the pilot's skill

365
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,370
that landed that plane on the river
as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.

366
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,772
Are you saying
that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?

367
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,307
No, no.

368
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,176
There were just other factors.

369
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,178
Are you not an American?

370
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,459
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit
out of my car or what?

371
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,160
I... Yeah.

372
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,331
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.

373
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,823
Fuck.

374
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,560
So, all I ask is that you give me
a little bit of time to gain your trust.

375
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:53,365
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack
in experience I make up for in clichés.

376
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,900
So, my door is always open.

377
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,506
But seriously, my door is always open.

378
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,411
My first order of business, lighter doors.

379
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,781
-Okay. Thanks, guys.
-Welcome, Dylan.

380
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,418
Hey, man. Tommy Bollinger, sports editor.

381
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,255
Tommy, I've read your articles.
Love your writing.

382
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,823
Just trying to keep it realsies.

383
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,293
Listen, I'd love to take you out one night
and troll for cock.

384
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,662
-What?
-You got some pretty boys out there in LA,

385
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,533
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.

386
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,668
We can tear this shit up.

387
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,403
I'm not gay, Tommy.

388
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,240
Really? I just assumed,
art director and, you know...

389
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,543
Hey. No skin, more pipe for me.

390
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,412
By the way,
doing a piece on racism in hockey.

391
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,648
Love to get your concepts on the font.

392
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,552
I'm thinking Helvetica
but I could be persuaded to Courier New.

393
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,855
But what the fuck do I know?
I'm just the sports editor.

394
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,958
-You sure you're not gay?
-Yep.

395
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,393
-I'm sure.
-Okay.

396
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,261
All right.

397
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,232
-Hey.
-Hey.

398
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,768
I'd knock, but you don't have a door.

399
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,336
-I don't.
-No.

400
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,571
Hey, check this out.

401
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,940
Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.

402
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,443
-Yeah, it really does exist.
-I told you, but not that. This.

403
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,546
Awesome.

404
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,448
But it'd be even more awesome
if this happened.

405
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,451
Wait for it.

406
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,353
Nice!

407
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,522
I got in touch with a guy
who puts flash mobs together.

408
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,891
We're thinking about using them
for guerrilla advertising.

409
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,460
Taking something so pure
and commercializing it?

410
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,262
Knew I found the right guy.

411
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,431
-Here I am.
-Okay. Here's your contract.

412
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,999
Sign it and I will be out of here.

413
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,001
Okay.

414
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,004
A whole year?

415
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,941
Why do I get the feeling this is the first
real commitment you've ever made?

416
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,544
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.

417
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,778
And, fuck, do I regret that one.

418
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,448
Do me a favor.
Don't quit or get fired before the year's up,

419
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,882
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.

420
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,517
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?

421
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,354
-What's the point of this contract?
-Just sign the damn thing.

422
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,622
Okay.

423
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,360
Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper.

424
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,631
Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch.
Do you know a place?

425
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,900
Are you asking me out?

426
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,570
Whoa, I'm not asking you out.

427
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,771
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.

428
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,573
I mean, I'm the only friend you have
in New York.

429
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,842
-You don't wanna complicate that.
-I know. I'm not asking you out.

430
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,910
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around,

431
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,346
-get into some erotic humiliation fantasy.
-Erotic?

432
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,716
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly,
and we'd never speak to each other again.

433
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,485
I'm not fucking asking you out!
I swear to God!

434
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay. You don't like me like that.

435
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,056
You don't have to be so mean about it.

436
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,026
I'm sorry. I didn't...

437
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,663
God, you're such a girl.
Come on, it's my treat.

438
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,799
So was it an easy move?

439
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,768
-It was tough leaving my dad.
-Yeah.

440
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,369
My sister gave me some shit.

441
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,571
But timing was right.

442
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,442
Timing was really right.

443
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,678
-Is that your sister?
-No. My ex.

444
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,946
She's great. Loves John Mayer.

445
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,416
Wants us to stay friends.

446
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,587
She's also convinced she can cure me
of my emotional unavailability.

447
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,091
-You're emotionally unavailable?
-Oh, yeah.

448
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,828
Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged.
I haven't seen you at the meetings.

449
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,364
I'm done with the relationship thing.

450
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,599
Girl, you are preaching to the congregation.

451
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,734
-Choir.
-What?

452
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,537
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed
to preach to the congregation.

453
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,572
-That's the expression.
-Did you understand what I was saying?

454
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,740
Then don't be a dick about it.

455
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,610
Oh, my God. Do you mind?

456
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,546
-Please.
-Great.

457
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,115
Hello. You've reached
Dylan Harper's cell phone.

458
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,017
He's emotionally unavailable,
but if you'd like...

459
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,119
-John fucking Mayer!
-Hello?

460
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,658
Wow. Hello?
You really do have shitty cell service.

461
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,859
-Right?
-Yeah.

462
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,763
I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.

463
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,132
Why don't you come,
and you can meet some new people?

464
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,801
I'm gonna have to check my schedule.
I'm really busy.

465
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,504
I work at GQ now.
It's not some little blog on the Internet.

466
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,908
-Hey.
-Hey.

467
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,477
-You made it.
-Sorry I'm late.

468
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,146
No, no. Please, come in, come in. Thank you.

469
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,148
Hey, everybody! Hey!

470
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,485
This here is Dylan. He's from LA.

471
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,988
He's the reason I can afford all this beer.

472
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,892
Okay, all right.

473
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,630
Am I an animal?

474
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,032
Yeah.

475
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,135
Fuck, I'm pretty good at this.

476
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,531
Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street artist
I got into about five years ago.

477
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,767
-His postmodern interpretation...
-This shit is amazing.

478
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:56,935
I know, right?

479
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,643
You will be able to find the perfect candidate
to fill the position at your company.

480
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,211
Okay, here we go.

481
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,649
First up is Joey Morena,
who's fluent in Vietnamese

482
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,818
and has had 10 years of experience
in the culinary field.

483
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,194
I can't do this anymore.

484
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,231
No, I think we both need to go get happy.

485
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,767
It's not adding up to a hundred anymore.

486
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,901
Yeah.

487
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,870
Looks like New York's all out of blueberries.

488
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,471
Goodbye, Flapjack.

489
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,108
Taxi! Taxicab!

490
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,510
Flapjack.

491
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,979
Why do all these movies
have such bad music?

492
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,849
It's so that you know how to feel
every single second.

493
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,016
"I'm heartbroken."

494
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,754
"I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams."

495
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,826
"I'm sneaking through an office."

496
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,097
Madison, wait!

497
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,600
Madison!

498
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,635
Madison, wait!

499
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,770
Bryce.

500
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,573
How did you know
I was at Grand Central Station?

501
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,543
You're not. You're in Los Angeles,
where this movie was shot.

502
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,278
I know you better than you know yourself.

503
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,249
And your crazy friend Susie
across the hall told me.

504
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,050
Susie.

505
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,253
Why are you here?

506
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,787
To tell you that

507
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,790
I love that sunsets make you cry,

508
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,160
and I don't care that you failed
your real estate exam,

509
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,796
and I'm glad that you have a five-date rule.

510
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,933
And that I love you.

511
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,068
Not as much as I love you.

512
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,773
Now boarding, track 5, love.

513
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,643
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.

514
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,745
You know, I'd never have to worry
about my hair,

515
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,613
or having to go to the bathroom.

516
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,082
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,

517
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,653
some guy would chase me down the street,
pour his heart out,

518
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,820
and we'd kiss.

519
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,956
Happily ever after.

520
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,793
I mean, a horse and carriage?

521
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,896
Come on, that is awesome.

522
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,565
Not as awesome as this
ambiguously upbeat pop song

523
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,134
that has nothing to do with the plot

524
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:14,039
they put in at the end to try to convince you
that you had a great time at this shitty movie.

525
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,043
You know, why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big kiss?

526
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,311
They do. It's called porn.

527
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,315
God, I miss sex.

528
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,818
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it.
It's like...

529
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,821
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.

530
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,923
Why does it always gotta
come with complications?

531
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,959
-And emotions.
-And guilt.

532
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,360
Guilt.

533
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,862
-It's women's fault.
-What?

534
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,700
You heard me. "Hold me.
Let's spend the rest of our lives together."

535
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,134
Oh, please, you are no better.

536
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,105
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now.
Say my name. Yeah...

537
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,841
"I'm done. How was I?"

538
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:50,976
Who have you been with?

539
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,979
Why can't it not be like that?

540
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,616
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.

541
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,119
Two people should be able to have sex
like they're playing tennis.

542
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,054
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to
go away for the weekend

543
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,389
after they play tennis.

544
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,892
It's just a game.
You shake hands, get on with your shit.

545
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,260
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

546
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,031
Do you want more beer?

547
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,133
Okay.

548
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,975
-Jamie!
-Yeah?

549
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,177
-Let's play tennis.
-What?

550
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,746
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.

551
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,047
Get the hell out of here.

552
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,883
Don't laugh. This could be great.

553
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,418
This could take all the weirdness out of it.

554
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,054
Well, we talked about this.
I don't like you like that.

555
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,790
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect.

556
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,693
I don't even know if I find you attractive.

557
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,861
That's cute.

558
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,662
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.

559
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,232
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?

560
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,833
-That's cute.
-No, no, no.

561
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,302
Before you got to know
my awesome personality.

562
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,437
Strictly physical.

563
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,873
First time you saw me.

564
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,309
-This is just two people talking?
-Yeah.

565
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,913
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.

566
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,451
I liked your eyes. I didn't think
I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.

567
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,757
Your lips. Yeah.
I thought you might be a good kisser.

568
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,159
I am.

569
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,027
-Your breasts.
-What about them?

570
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,362
-They intrigued me.
-Really?

571
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,898
-Yeah.
-I think they're so tiny.

572
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,933
-They're still breasts.
-Thanks.

573
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,702
-I liked your hands.
-Mouth.

574
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:25,970
-Butt.
-Voice.

575
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,072
-Chest.
-Eyes.

576
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,840
-You said that.
-I meant it.

577
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,913
You swear you don't want anything more
from me other than sex?

578
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,815
You swear you don't want anything
more from me?

579
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,318
I know how you girls get.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

580
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,486
Stop it.

581
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,491
-What are you doing?
-I'm pulling up my Bible app.

582
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,461
-You have a Bible app?
-Yes. I am a good girl.

583
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,962
-Hand on the iPad.
-Okay.

584
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,363
Wait, no.

585
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,832
Why can't they figure this out?

586
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,202
No... This thing thinks I'm you and you're me.

587
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,870
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.

588
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,238
-It's actually making me dizzy.
-Hold on.

589
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,874
There we go.

590
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,513
No relationship.

591
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,148
No emotions.

592
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,916
Just sex.

593
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,519
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

594
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:15,920
-Swear.
-Swear.

595
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,088
-Swear.
-Swear.

596
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,393
Okay.

597
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,400
So I guess we should just start.

598
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,003
Okay.

599
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,105
I'll serve.

600
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,441
That's really... That's enough of the tennis.

601
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,776
Let's go to the bedroom.

602
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,844
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

603
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,246
The bedroom has better light.

604
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,048
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

605
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,117
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

606
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,286
You have nothing to be insecure about.

607
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,290
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

608
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,392
and you need to just lock that down.

609
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,863
-Your ass is a little bony.
-Much better.

610
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,866
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

611
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,969
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

612
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,472
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

613
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,107
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

614
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,341
I wouldn't have shaved my legs this morning.

615
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,576
Okie-dokie.

616
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,247
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

617
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,249
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

618
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,818
Great.

619
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,156
I can work with that.

620
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,093
Should be fine.

621
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,364
I can't believe I'm doing this.

622
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,366
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.

623
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,101
I don't know, are we getting too old for this?

624
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,604
-Sex?
-No, casual sex.

625
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,507
It just, I don't know, feels a little collegey.

626
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,609
-I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
-Okay.

627
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,515
-That's not Third Eye Blind.
-I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

628
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,850
Nope.

629
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,589
-What's wrong?
-We're just doing this once.

630
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,023
-I totally agree.
-Okay.

631
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,258
-Great.
-Great.

632
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,492
Little faster.

633
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,628
-More circular.
-Watch my chin.

634
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,230
-Touch my ears.
-Okay.

635
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,132
Kiss my neck.

636
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,635
-Say my name.
-Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

637
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:11,936
Not my full name.

638
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,204
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

639
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,339
-Stop talking.
-Okay.

640
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,374
Oh, my God, you're really...

641
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:23,615
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P...

642
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,184
-Dylan, I...
-Relax.

643
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,386
Just a friend going down on another friend.

644
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,288
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

645
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,526
What, what?

646
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,896
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

647
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,264
-I'm good at this.
-Says who?

648
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,632
Every girl I've been with.

649
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,268
Well, they're either lying
or their vaginas are made out of burlap.

650
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,270
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

651
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,138
-Okay, fine.
-Okay, fine.

652
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,376
-A little to the right.
-Okay.

653
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,211
-A little bit more to the left.
-Roger that.

654
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,679
-Now go down.
-Here we go.

655
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,382
-A little more... Whoa, too far!
-Sorry.

656
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,355
-What's wrong?
-Nothing!

657
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,024
When women start to scream,
it could be misconstrued.

658
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,525
Just keep going!

659
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,202
Yeah, you know it.

660
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,043
Well, let me tell you how I like it.

661
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,946
See, most girls think
you should start off soft,

662
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,416
but if you just get in, really go for it...

663
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,596
Yeah, you know it.

664
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,119
-Let's go with Obama.
-No, no, no, no!

665
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,055
It's too easy, too predictable. Go with Shaun.

666
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:16,094
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

667
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,097
-I hear he's kind of a jerk.
-No, he's not.

668
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,231
You're just threatened by him

669
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,667
because he's the greatest snow sport athlete
in the universe

670
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,702
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

671
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,105
Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

672
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,272
Okay, thanks.

673
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,608
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

674
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,311
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.

675
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,645
He's got ears like an elephant.

676
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,115
That's not the part of an elephant you want.

677
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,253
-Hi!
-Hi.

678
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,425
Sorry to just show up like this.

679
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,659
No, no, no, it's fine.

680
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,528
So...

681
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,399
-Wanna take a walk?
-Love to.

682
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,701
Great. Okay.

683
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,741
Okay, so about what happened, I...

684
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,711
-It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
-Exactly. No, no, exactly.

685
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,179
I mean, it is so not me.

686
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,281
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

687
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,785
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

688
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,288
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but...

689
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,290
Really?

690
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,293
Look, to think that you and I
could just have sex

691
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,562
and without it compromising anything
was just so...

692
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,131
-Misguided.
-Exactly.

693
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,599
I was gonna call you this morning.

694
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,834
But you didn't.

695
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,169
But I didn't.

696
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,404
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really...

697
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,739
I just don't want it to.

698
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:35,840
It's not going to.

699
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,843
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really...

700
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,813
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

701
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,449
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

702
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:49,287
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that
every time you curse, you blink.

703
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,723
-Like your body's rejecting the word.
-It does not.

704
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,825
-Fuck you.
-Blinked.

705
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,726
-No, I didn't fucking blink.
-Blinked again.

706
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,562
-Shit.
-Ah, didn't blink.

707
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,297
"Shit" you're okay with.

708
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,332
-It was stupid.
-Yes.

709
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,335
-We're friends, let's stay friends.
-Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

710
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,570
Me neither.

711
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,737
-Great.
-Fantastic.

712
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,706
Portrait for the lovely couple?

713
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,850
-What the hell are we doing?
-I don't know.

714
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,488
-Rub my hair.
-Kiss my neck.

715
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,625
-Watch my nipple.
-All right, all right.

716
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,229
-I didn't know you had a tattoo.
-Yeah.

717
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,597
Why didn't I notice that before?

718
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,265
Because we were drunk.

719
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,334
-Was it your dog?
-No. Never had one.

720
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,502
But everyone else did.

721
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,337
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

722
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,172
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

723
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,207
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

724
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,709
of the most conventional thing
you could think of.

725
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,511
It was super awesome back then.

726
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,745
-Check it.
-Okay.

727
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,280
-A lightning bolt?
-Eighteen.

728
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,548
-Wanted superpowers.
-Yeah.

729
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,384
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

730
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,154
-Were you also gay back then?
-Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

731
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,855
-Okay.
-Are you sure about this?

732
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,157
-Are you?
-No.

733
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,391
Me neither.

734
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,931
-How was your day?
-It was okay.

735
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,367
-I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.
-How was that?

736
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,235
It wasn't that good. How was your day?

737
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,671
Still trying to figure out that subway system.
It is tricky.

738
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,942
And it's out of here!

739
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,917
-My butt.
-What?

740
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,685
-Oh, my butt.
-Really?

741
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,855
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping.
Can you grab a pillow?

742
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,323
Okay, yeah, yeah.

743
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,426
-So, no butt?
-No.

744
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,399
-Really? Already?
-Just kidding.

745
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,573
-Do you like this position?
-Yeah, it's all right.

746
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,444
I gotta be honest, I feel a little emasculated.

747
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:58,349
A naked girl is lying on top of you
and you feel emasculated?

748
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,752
-Little bit.
-You do know what that word means, right?

749
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,854
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.

750
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,324
Okay, all right, you big baby.

751
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,559
-Chinese fire drill.
-Okay. Go!

752
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,862
Okay.

753
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,300
-Do you feel manly now?
-I do.

754
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,635
Okay. Put it in.

755
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,004
That's not funny.

756
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,872
-It's kind of funny.
-It's kind of funny.

757
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,578
-Hold on.
-What's wrong?

758
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,679
I have to go to the bathroom.

759
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,249
-What? Now?
-Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.

760
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,494
What's going on in there?

761
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,296
Do you know how hard it is
to pee with a hard-on?

762
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,397
No, actually.

763
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,733
It's like two lanes of traffic merging into one.
It takes time.

764
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,841
-Are you pooping?
-No.

765
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,043
-Why are you sitting down?
-It's easier to control.

766
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,046
-You want a mess in here?
-No. No, no. Sorry.

767
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,395
Yeah.

768
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,063
Yup.

769
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,401
What? Did I leak?

770
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,535
Did you wash your hands?

771
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:25,936
Oh, come on, dude.

772
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,772
I know we're just friends, but I'm still a lady.

773
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,509
Now get back in there, wash your hands
and then bring that fine ass back here.

774
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,078
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'm not gonna come back.

775
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,720
-My hammies are killing me.
-Have a banana, they're in the fridge.

776
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,322
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?

777
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,657
-It dries them out.
-It doesn't. They have a peel.

778
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,359
It's not armor. Air still gets in.

779
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,660
Do you want a banana or not?

780
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,329
Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.

781
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,965
At least I have food in the house.

782
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,934
All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.

783
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,370
I like to drink my yogurt. It's a timesaver.

784
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,806
Well, then you think you could use that time
to shave your stubble.

785
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,474
Your whiskers are like knives.

786
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,111
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend,
I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

787
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,680
And because you're just my buddy,
I can tell you

788
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:14,585
that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

789
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,624
Hey, hey. Hey...

790
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,360
-Mom!
-"Mom"?

791
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,130
My eyes are covered.
I don't know what you're doing.

792
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,966
I can't see you putting on
your black underpants.

793
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,035
Jamie, baby, I missed you.

794
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,603
Oh, baby.

795
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,005
Did your boobs get bigger?
Mom, I'm over here.

796
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,109
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.

797
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:42,046
-What are you doing here?
-Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.

798
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,716
L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
"Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."

799
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,017
Victor, her fiancé.

800
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,619
Ex-fiancé.

801
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,755
-What happened?
-Nothing. He was just blah.

802
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,723
I mean, nice, but it was like talking to dirt.

803
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,626
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna..."
I'm Lorna.

804
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,497
-Dylan.
-I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss.

805
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,532
-"Just because you're 39..."
-Forty-eight.

806
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,101
"...it doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

807
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,070
So I caught the first plane off the island.

808
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,906
-Cleveland's not an island.
-Oh, baby, it is.

809
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,842
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.

810
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,478
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.

811
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,414
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

812
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,182
-That's right, we're just friends.
-I love it.

813
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,818
It's like the '70s in here.

814
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,754
That was a better time. Just sex.

815
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,891
A little grass, a little glue...
Not during pregnancy.

816
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,726
Well, not during the final trimester.

817
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,429
But no complications. It's great!

818
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,965
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess,
what this is.

819
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,500
That's exactly what this is.

820
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,502
So my daughter is just your slampiece?

821
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,504
No, no. "Slampiece"?

822
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,807
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

823
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,141
Have fun. I think this is great.

824
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,943
The only thing is, it takes you off the market.

825
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,012
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

826
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,915
is to buy the produce, which you already got.

827
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:56,053
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

828
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,088
I'm starving. You got any gin?

829
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,057
It's in the kitchen.

830
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,693
You gotta go.

831
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,496
-Is she wearing Axe body spray?
-I don't know. Come on.

832
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,832
Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

833
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,702
-That is terrible, Mother.
-Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.

834
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,237
What? You said that he was Greek.

835
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,905
-Potato, potato...
-Get your shoes.

836
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,608
-Okay. All right.
-Well, not... Just go, just go.

837
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,109
I'll just put these on on the bike?

838
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,478
-Yeah.
-Okay.

839
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,979
It was nice to have met you...

840
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,747
-Hey.
-And your pants are coming off.

841
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,883
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!

842
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,119
Back, back!

843
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,025
That's what I'm talking about!

844
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,262
We're kicking every gay ass out here!

845
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,865
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

846
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,600
Hold it. Any of you gay?

847
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,101
-Not even you?
-Come on, man.

848
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,270
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

849
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,172
I might be able to let you see some reason.

850
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,080
Look at you in the house!

851
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,281
Come on, baby!

852
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,984
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.

853
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,786
Who's that, that headhunter?

854
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,221
What, you guys going out now?

855
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,024
No, no, no, we're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

856
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,059
-What do you mean?
-Sleeping together.

857
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,561
But it's just sex.

858
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,129
That never works, bro.

859
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:16,033
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

860
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,201
Jamie's different.

861
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,937
Does she have a penis
where most girls have a vagina?

862
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,772
-No penis.
-Then she's no different.

863
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,307
What do you know about women, anyway?

864
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,143
Dude, I've turned down more tail
than you'll ever have.

865
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,545
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

866
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,315
But the offers still keep rolling in, naturally.
Look at me.

867
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:37,821
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful,
majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.

868
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,892
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

869
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,729
And if I had a choice,
I would be with women to my dying day.

870
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,966
But me likes cock so I'm strict-aly dick-aly.

871
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,269
So it's always just about sex, then?

872
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,839
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

873
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,341
You know what I discovered?

874
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,110
It's not who you want to spend
Friday night with,

875
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,746
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

876
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,881
Feel me, Felix?

877
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,251
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

878
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,186
It's okay, you don't get it.

879
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,722
It's no big deal. But you will.

880
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,193
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

881
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:20,598
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

882
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,000
-Like a fish...
-Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

883
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,668
Yeah, you don't.

884
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,605
Nice work on that new online site,
by the way.

885
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,373
What was the font on that headline?

886
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,841
It was Times Roman.

887
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,210
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

888
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,884
You have a boat?

889
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,254
I live in Jersey. And I ain't taking no ferry.

890
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,890
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.

891
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,108
-Hey.
-Yeah.

892
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:09,647
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

893
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,281
Kudos, baby, kudos.

894
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,151
It's not that big of a deal.

895
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,255
It's just surprising. I always thought
you were a true-love kind of girl.

896
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,759
Whatever, Mom.
It's not like it's stopping me from anything.

897
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,761
That's what I thought back in '78.

898
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,863
And every year since.

899
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,298
I'm just... I'm flattered, actually.

900
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,401
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

901
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,137
It's just surprising.

902
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,307
-There, done. It's... There we go.
-Okay.

903
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,012
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

904
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,914
-Yeah!
-Really?

905
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,282
-Yeah.
-Okay.

906
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,253
Hey, my friend gave me his house
in Montauk for July 4th.

907
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,256
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

908
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,192
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

909
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,462
When was the last time
we spent a full weekend together?

910
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,765
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

911
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:02,933
-Demitri.
-Bill.

912
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,334
He reminded me a lot of your father.

913
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:08,038
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

914
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,040
-My father was Russian?
-I don't remember.

915
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,210
But what I do remember is we drank
a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

916
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,914
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game
is getting really old.

917
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,817
I know I haven't been
the best mother in the world...

918
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,188
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

919
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,458
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

920
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,194
Come on. Come on.

921
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,397
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

922
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,072
-Mom...
-I was trying to bond!

923
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,508
It was either this or sniff glue.

924
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,316
-Sorry about my mom.
-I thought she was funny.

925
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,219
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

926
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,988
and she's hilarious
when she needs a place to stay.

927
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,363
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

928
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,267
Listen, I think we should stop this.

929
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,505
Yeah?

930
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,273
I kind of think you're right.

931
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,407
Right?

932
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:23,180
Every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end

933
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,048
That actually makes sense right here.

934
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,084
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind
could be so prophetic?

935
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,252
Not Third Eye Blind.

936
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,154
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

937
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,355
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

938
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,556
-Yes.
-Okay.

939
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,391
-You're buying.
-What?

940
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,861
Okay.

941
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,165
-Pants.
-Shirt.

942
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,033
So this is the end of this?

943
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,035
-I guess so. But it's good.
-Yeah.

944
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,436
-And we did it.
-With no bullshit.

945
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,804
-Shirt.
-Sweater.

946
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,407
We managed to actually stay friends.

947
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,009
-Yup.
-Yeah.

948
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,182
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

949
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,317
No, I don't have a type.

950
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,586
-It's more about what's inside.
-Oh, please!

951
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,488
Okay, what about her?

952
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,157
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

953
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,325
And she's reading a book.

954
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,427
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

955
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,896
-I'm gonna go talk to her.
-What?

956
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,065
What do you mean, "What?"
We said we wanted to date again.

957
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,900
-I'm gonna go talk to her.
-Now?

958
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,435
Here, in front of all of these people?

959
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,939
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

960
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,478
Excuse me. I'm Dylan. Nice to meet you.

961
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,180
The Notebook.

962
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,621
Nice meeting you.

963
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,994
-Well?
-We talked. We laughed.

964
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,195
Yeah.

965
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,497
-She's Belgian.
-Explains the reading.

966
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,266
I showed her where the balcony was,

967
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,102
because that's where
she is meeting up with her husband.

968
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:55,239
Anniversary trip to New York.

969
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,475
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

970
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,611
Shut up.

971
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,514
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

972
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,384
Fine. I'll go next.

973
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,120
-See if I still have game.
-Okay.

974
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,488
-Okay.
-Okay.

975
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,190
-Yes.
-Right here. Eleven o'clock.

976
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,059
-Iced coffee.
-Handsome, but doesn't know it.

977
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,496
Staring at a tree, which means
he's actually in the park for nature

978
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,265
and not to watch women sunbathe.

979
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,033
-Or he's retarded.
-Don't care.

980
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,234
I'm going in.

981
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,476
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

982
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,144
-Hi.
-Hello.

983
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,979
I'm Jamie.

984
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,682
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

985
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,685
Hi.

986
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,289
Okay.

987
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,490
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, my God!

988
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:56,099
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

989
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,036
And I have a date this Saturday.

990
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,438
-Nice.
-Thank you.

991
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,141
Why'd you wave to me?

992
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,477
I told him you were my gay best friend,

993
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,379
so he wants to set you up with his brother.

994
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:16,019
College, med school,
and I haven't slept since.

995
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,355
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.

996
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,624
Well, me and God.

997
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,060
-What?
-I'm kidding.

998
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,696
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

999
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,065
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

1000
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,733
-Cancer doctors?
-No, assholes.

1001
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,468
Yeah.

1002
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,736
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.

1003
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,441
Although, I gotta warn you,
lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.

1004
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:38,542
-Really?
-Yeah.

1005
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,578
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.

1006
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,514
While they're doing this, a little bit of that.

1007
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,217
Hey.

1008
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,753
Thank you.

1009
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,655
When can I see you again?

1010
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,760
Right now.

1011
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,629
-I'm just kidding.
-Okay.

1012
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,498
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

1013
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,767
I played the tuba in high school.

1014
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,236
World's stupidest instrument.

1015
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,271
Especially when you move eight times.

1016
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:12,109
-Why'd you move?
-My mom really likes to break up with guys,

1017
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,543
and she was really good at it.

1018
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,079
-Was your dad one of them?
-No, no, he was long before that.

1019
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,647
I actually never knew my dad.

1020
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,416
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1021
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,654
All right, look,
I think I should probably tell you something.

1022
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,323
Please don't tell me you're a dude.

1023
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,592
Because that'll be like the third time
since I moved here,

1024
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,394
and I don't think I can handle that.

1025
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:31,661
I have a five-date rule.

1026
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,265
-You know, like, five dates before we...
-Yeah.

1027
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,168
I saw it in a movie. I thought I'd give it a try.

1028
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,437
You're worth waiting for.

1029
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,407
I'm sure that was the line
in the movie you saw.

1030
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,276
That's awesome.

1031
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,246
This four-year-old that I've been working on
for the last couple months,

1032
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,447
he's gonna be fine.

1033
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,815
-That's great.
-Yeah.

1034
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,351
How is a guy like you single?

1035
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:57,454
I've just been waiting for someone
to come up to me in the park

1036
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,123
and compliment me for looking at the trees
and not the sunbathers.

1037
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,525
I meant it. It was impressive.

1038
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,627
Actually, if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you,

1039
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,462
I was sleeping standing up.

1040
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,665
I worked 36 hours straight.
I don't even know how I got to the park.

1041
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,067
How is a girl like you single?

1042
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,137
I have issues.

1043
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,739
One might even call me damaged.

1044
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,574
Actually, one did call me damaged.

1045
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,809
Get out of here. Damaged how?

1046
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,744
I kind of believe in true love.

1047
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,147
That there might be
a Prince Charming out there for me.

1048
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:34,357
Listen, I know this is probably a no
because all you do is work like a dull boy,

1049
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,693
but would you like to come get a beer?

1050
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:37,794
I'm good.

1051
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,663
No, it's not a gay bar.

1052
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,733
And there'll be just as many hot girls
as hot guys.

1053
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,238
You know what? I will come out.

1054
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,174
All right. Let's find you a lady.

1055
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,276
You're still not gay, right?

1056
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,611
-Nope.
-Okay.

1057
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,219
-What?
-Do you know what today is?

1058
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,489
-Date number five.
-I wasn't even counting.

1059
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,730
-Wanna go in the bedroom?
-No. Here's fine.

1060
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,372
I am so glad I met you tonight.

1061
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,407
Me, too.

1062
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,247
What are you thinking?

1063
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,350
Just how great you are.

1064
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,329
Annie, hey.

1065
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,665
Who the fuck is Annie?

1066
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:49,933
My sister.

1067
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,269
Better be. I'll cut her.

1068
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,805
Of course I'm coming.

1069
00:52:56,273 --> 00:53:00,410
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off,
so I'll be there for three days.

1070
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,656
Yeah. How's Dad?

1071
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,558
Any worse?

1072
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,927
All right, tell him I said hi.

1073
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,429
Bye, Banannie.

1074
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,435
I want you to meet my parents.

1075
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,871
No, you... Really?

1076
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,713
God!

1077
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,233
Hey. Hold on, hold on.

1078
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,403
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.

1079
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,340
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.

1080
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,577
Shit. Shit. Just hold on.

1081
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:08,812
-Oh, sorry.
-Hold on.

1082
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,580
I was out pretty late last night.

1083
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,750
When I got in, you and your girlfriend
were on the couch

1084
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,485
so I just crashed in your bed.

1085
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,354
-He's not a girl.
-He smells like a girl.

1086
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,623
-You smelled him?
-I wanna buy marshmallows.

1087
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,392
-What did you say?
-For Montauk this weekend.

1088
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,295
I wanna do a campfire,
like when you were little.

1089
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,429
Okay.

1090
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,466
-And then we're gonna look for sticks.
-I hear you. Sticks.

1091
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,502
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna...

1092
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,604
Just hold on a second.

1093
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,740
Okay.

1094
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,943
Okay.

1095
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,282
What's up?

1096
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,318
Do you think guys care more
about global warming

1097
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,720
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?

1098
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:51,888
Well, that depends.

1099
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,724
Do you have a hot model in a bikini
standing on an icecap?

1100
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,559
No. Ski slope.

1101
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,628
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.

1102
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,397
Yeah, me, too.

1103
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,633
How's your boy Parker? Still staring at trees?

1104
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,935
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

1105
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,405
but this time it's actually in my apartment.

1106
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,807
-It's the fifth date already?
-Maybe. Thank you.

1107
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,677
Did you guys "fifth-date"?

1108
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,547
-How dare you! A lady never tells.
-I know. That's why I'm asking you.

1109
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,853
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great trip in LA
and call me when you land.

1110
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,388
Okay.

1111
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:26,856
Parker.

1112
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,825
Hey.

1113
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,929
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

1114
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,065
-I gotta get going.
-What?

1115
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,566
I thought you weren't on call today.

1116
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,903
I'm not, but I got that thing... I got stuff.

1117
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,705
This... They just called me.

1118
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,675
-Really?
-Yeah.

1119
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,945
The sneak-out. How incredibly cliché of you.

1120
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,580
I just...

1121
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,450
I don't think I can be your Prince Charming.

1122
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,419
God, you totally didn't get
anything that I was saying, did you?

1123
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,823
-No, no, no. I think you're great.
-Yeah, you, too.

1124
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,791
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

1125
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,893
-Really?
-No, go fuck yourself.

1126
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,139
Who sleeps standing up?

1127
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,841
You know, you'd be really proud of me.

1128
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,909
I didn't even blink
when I told him to go fuck himself.

1129
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,747
-You did just then, though.
-This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

1130
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:25,949
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.

1131
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,517
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.

1132
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,986
-Thank you.
-So needy.

1133
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,788
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.

1134
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,723
No, did a background check at work.

1135
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,893
Single, no criminal history, credit report 720.

1136
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,661
Background check. Did you do one on me?

1137
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,897
How could you possibly
max out an Old Navy card?

1138
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,166
After college I was really into cargo pants.

1139
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,770
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me.

1140
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,072
-I mean, it's gotta be me.
-It's not you.

1141
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,540
Nothing is wrong with you.

1142
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,609
He's a guy.
You gave him a five-date challenge,

1143
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,011
he got you and cut out. Forget the douche.

1144
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,680
He's a dick. He's a dick-douche.

1145
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,416
Go have fun with your mom.

1146
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,953
-Okay.
-Almost forgot. I got you something.

1147
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,197
It's Lieutenant Kali,
the street artist we talked about.

1148
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,933
I got him to do something for you.
"F-tale." Fairytale.

1149
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,804
-I know you're into that girly shit, so...
-This is so cool.

1150
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,840
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.

1151
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,942
-It's cool, right?
-Yeah. Thank you.

1152
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,546
Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.

1153
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,782
I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

1154
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,950
No problem.

1155
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,085
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

1156
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,556
What are you doing?

1157
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,924
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

1158
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,460
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

1159
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:48,932
Hey, Ma.

1160
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,735
Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road.

1161
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,537
Come on.

1162
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,005
Ma?

1163
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,593
Why did I think that
this time would be any different?

1164
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,194
-Come with me to LA.
-What?

1165
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,030
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

1166
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,899
You're very sweet for asking, but it's fine.

1167
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,701
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

1168
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,003
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

1169
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,873
I'm actually asking you to come
because it would help me.

1170
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,875
You'd be a great distraction for my family.

1171
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,143
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

1172
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,578
Won't they think that we're together?

1173
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,714
-Not if I tell them we're not.
-And they'll believe you?

1174
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,116
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

1175
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,718
PBS is doing a documentary on us.

1176
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:42,886
Come on, they'll love you.

1177
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,555
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

1178
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,691
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

1179
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:49,993
Go to the gym.

1180
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,096
I just got you a ticket with my miles,
it's done. Meet me at JFK.

1181
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,697
-But...
-No buts.

1182
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,667
-Like you were gonna go to the gym.
-I wasn't.

1183
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,749
LA's so nice.

1184
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,084
And everyone's so genuine and level-headed.

1185
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,789
Thanks for this. You're good peeps.

1186
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,591
You're the good peeps, dude.

1187
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,193
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

1188
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,163
Okay.

1189
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,198
You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

1190
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,235
Nobody cares. You sound like an asshole.

1191
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,071
She's from New York.

1192
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,673
I'm sorry.

1193
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,619
Wow. This looks normal.

1194
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,920
It is.

1195
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:52,922
Thank you.

1196
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,995
Wow, you grew up here?

1197
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,698
It was my grandfather's.

1198
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,333
He bought it
when there was nothing else here.

1199
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,835
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

1200
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,105
Why would you move to New York?

1201
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,840
I was conned by some headhunter.

1202
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,376
-You're here.
-Sammy!

1203
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,711
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

1204
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,012
What's up, buddy?

1205
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,014
How are you?

1206
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,883
Jamie, this is my nephew,
Sam the Magnificent.

1207
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,753
-Hello.
-May I offer you a light for your cigarette?

1208
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,355
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

1209
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,290
Just pretend. He's a magician.

1210
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,293
Of course I'll have a cigarette.
Smoking is great for you.

1211
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:38,034
-Wow. Thank you, good sir.
-My pleasure, my lady.

1212
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,203
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.

1213
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,405
Sammy. I got it, I got it.
Just stay still. I got it, I got it.

1214
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,207
Sammy! Are you okay?

1215
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,675
All part of the illusion.

1216
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,276
-Jet Skis later?
-Definitely.

1217
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,646
Still into magic, huh?

1218
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,882
Yep. But I'll take that over him
sexting his friends any day.

1219
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,918
-Dilbert!
-Banannie.

1220
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:59,756
Jamie, this is my sister, Annie.

1221
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,190
-Hi.
-Thank you for having me.

1222
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,226
Oh, please.
It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.

1223
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,961
-We're just friends.
-Oh, no, I know.

1224
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,163
If you were his girlfriend,
he never would've brought you here.

1225
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,033
-This one has intimacy issues.
-I know.

1226
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,167
-Dylan.
-Dad.

1227
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,969
-Dylan. Oh, man.
-Hey.

1228
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,338
-How you doing, buddy?
-I'm good.

1229
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,407
I miss you guys, but I'm good.

1230
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:19,942
Dede Spencer?

1231
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,211
Jamie. Dylan's friend.

1232
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,115
-I'm sorry. I...
-That's okay.

1233
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,184
No, for a minute you reminded me
of a girl I used to know.

1234
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,753
-No, that's okay. It happens.
-Nice to meet you.

1235
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,922
Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

1236
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,057
Thank you.

1237
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,427
Pool's a little cold,
but it's very expensive to heat, so...

1238
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,430
I think I'm gonna go in
and check the tide tables

1239
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,198
'cause I'm gonna take the boat out
early in the morning.

1240
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,900
-You should come.
-I would love to.

1241
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,468
We sold the boat.

1242
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,804
The doctor doesn't want you
driving the boat anymore.

1243
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,941
-Turning to mush.
-No.

1244
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,812
It's good to see you, buddy.

1245
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,413
-Nice to meet you.
-It was nice meeting you, too.

1246
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,315
-Jamie. See?
-Yes.

1247
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,190
-What's with the pants?
-He doesn't like them anymore.

1248
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,225
He's getting worse.

1249
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,327
It's so good to have you here.

1250
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:13,730
Go show her the beach.

1251
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,100
-Let me show you the beach. Come on.
-Okay.

1252
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,103
-Go, get sandy. Get all messed up.
-Okay.

1253
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,754
Dylan never told me about your dad.

1254
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,423
Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

1255
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,025
Dylan doesn't quite know
how to deal with the Alzheimer's.

1256
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,260
I'm sorry.

1257
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,029
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

1258
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,866
and then just in a flash, he's gone.

1259
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,237
-That's Dylan when he was nine.
-Are those braids?

1260
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,140
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

1261
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:05,314
-Is that your mom?
-No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

1262
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,385
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

1263
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,154
He had a rough childhood.

1264
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,257
-His math tutor called it "character-building."
-Math tutor?

1265
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,227
No, we're talking, like, 8 times 6 equals 1,200.

1266
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,396
But he's very visual, thank God.

1267
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:25,168
-Can you please explain to me this photo?
-That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.

1268
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,303
-Hey.
-Amazing moment.

1269
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,172
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.

1270
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,341
-Jamie, you all good with your room?
-Yeah. No, it's perfect.

1271
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,477
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1272
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,451
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box,
so just be careful on your way to bed.

1273
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,888
-He's not using a real saw, is he?
-Of course he is. He's magnificent.

1274
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,559
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth,
and you, don't believe anything she says.

1275
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,294
She's a liar.

1276
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,897
-He's a pretty special guy.
-Yeah, I think so.

1277
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,468
-Jamie. Hey.
-Hey.

1278
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,070
-You up?
-Yeah. Come in.

1279
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,842
-I thought you were going to bed.
-I was.

1280
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,477
But then I realized
we were both single again, so...

1281
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,916
-Dude, no.
-Why not?

1282
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,952
I washed my hands. With soap this time.

1283
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,987
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

1284
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,858
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

1285
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,228
I cracked my neck
because we were on a flight for six hours,

1286
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,631
and you were yapping my ear off
about how planes all fly themselves,

1287
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,333
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.

1288
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,202
-So, no?
-No. Not having sex with you.

1289
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,538
Is it your special time?
They have an app for that. No, wait.

1290
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,443
-Nope, you're good to go.
-We talked about this.

1291
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,246
-Plus, I just got dumped, so...
-Okay, I'm sorry.

1292
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,581
I thought this would be a good way
to take your mind off him.

1293
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,984
No, I don't function that way.
Sex is not gonna help.

1294
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,419
But you know what will? Emotional support.

1295
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,389
Before we were sex without emotion,
and now we're emotion without sex.

1296
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,024
Exactly.

1297
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,959
I just need you to be my friend right now.

1298
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,128
Okay. So I'll listen to you
while you give me a hand job.

1299
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,631
-No.
-I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.

1300
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:06,035
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out
and, I don't know, listen to music.

1301
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,270
Listen to music?

1302
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:10,406
I'm gonna kill Annie.

1303
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:14,243
-I can't believe you used to like them.
-I didn't like these guys.

1304
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,411
I don't even remember...

1305
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,426
And then there's something,
I don't know what he says right there...

1306
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,431
Are you kidding me?
These dudes were da bomb.

1307
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,433
Everybody had Girbauds,
we all wore them backwards.

1308
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,567
The baseball jerseys.

1309
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,405
I went as Kris Kross
three years in a row for Halloween.

1310
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,674
-Oh, you poor kid.
-I'm not proud of it.

1311
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,577
Hey, I borrowed one of your books.
I hope that's okay.

1312
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,449
Like this.

1313
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,053
No.

1314
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,729
Surprise!

1315
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,736
Have you really never brought
a girl home before?

1316
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,705
I brought you here.

1317
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,175
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.

1318
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,078
-A real girl?
-Yeah.

1319
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,613
I guess not.

1320
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,483
-Separation of church and state.
-Ah, yes.

1321
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:31,187
Build up as many walls as possible.
That's really healthy.

1322
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,356
-What, are you talking to me about walls?
-Yeah.

1323
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,658
What about you and your mom?

1324
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,761
You couldn't get me out of there fast enough
when she walked in on us.

1325
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,163
That was for your own protection. Okay?

1326
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:45,101
I'm just surprised she didn't try
to slip you her number or something.

1327
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,336
She did. She put it in my phone.

1328
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,505
-Under "MILF."
-Oh, my God.

1329
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,375
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.

1330
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,278
I'm starting to get a mental image.

1331
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:57,546
Well, I have a video image.

1332
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,783
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.

1333
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,521
Just wrong.

1334
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,126
What?

1335
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,796
Nothing. Just glad I met you.

1336
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,402
Yeah, well, knowing you doesn't suck either.

1337
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:40,423
-But I thought you said...
-I know what I said.

1338
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,654
God.

1339
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,681
Lasorda was a good pitcher,
but he was an even better manager.

1340
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,350
-Wrecking Crew?
-I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.

1341
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,219
He's underappreciated as a pitcher,
that's all I'm saying.

1342
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,554
We get it. Guys.

1343
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:52,721
-Hi.
-Morning.

1344
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,425
-Good morning.
-Is it always this beautiful out here?

1345
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,728
Well, in between the fires and the floods,
we get about 10 good days.

1346
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,598
No, no. Here. You two sit together.

1347
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:03,966
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah, no, no.

1348
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,802
-You don't have to do that, Dad.
-I know. I wanna look at the boat.

1349
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,704
I love that boat.

1350
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,839
-Here. Sorry.
-Great. Thanks.

1351
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,474
Here.

1352
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,878
Thank you. This... Okay.

1353
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,648
-Coffee, my lady?
-Yes, please.

1354
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:21,984
Thank you.

1355
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,388
-All right, man!
-Look at you!

1356
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:29,658
-That's pretty impressive.
-Yay, Sammy!

1357
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,493
All right!

1358
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,564
Oh, buddy. Your shirt's leaking.
Oh, no, that's...

1359
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,765
Apologies.

1360
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,671
Here.

1361
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,877
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1362
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,347
-You?
-Yeah.

1363
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,894
-See them, Sammy?
-Yeah.

1364
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,765
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

1365
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,534
God, it's nice.

1366
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:16,839
I do miss the mornings out here.
Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful.

1367
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,407
I like Jamie.

1368
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,778
And she's pretty, too.

1369
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,648
Hey, easy, dude.
Don't you go casting a spell on her.

1370
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:29,652
I'm a magician, not a wizard.
You and your gay Harry Potter.

1371
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,688
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts
wouldn't be life-changing.

1372
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,392
-I miss you.
-I miss you, too, bud.

1373
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:40,062
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.

1374
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,399
Does he say anything?

1375
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,535
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.

1376
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,906
He said that he didn't want the job.

1377
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,809
That he was just coming to New York
to explore his options.

1378
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,344
What a crock of gas.

1379
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,380
You fly across the country
to explore your options?

1380
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,782
Please. I don't think so.

1381
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:03,585
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him
the second he got off that plane.

1382
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:04,853
-Oh, did you, now?
-Yeah.

1383
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,589
Was that the same second you leapt
onto the baggage carousel barefoot

1384
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:08,957
and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?

1385
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,560
-She did?
-Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.

1386
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,928
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."

1387
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,630
You know what? It was all part of my plan.

1388
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:15,831
Quite a plan.

1389
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,499
Did you major in Planning
at Headhunting College?

1390
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,835
-So clever.
-It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.

1391
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:23,005
You guys bicker like
you're an old married couple.

1392
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,640
Here, pick a card, my lady.

1393
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:25,841
Okay.

1394
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,910
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.

1395
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,112
-This is a good one.
-So...

1396
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,580
-Yeah?
-Shuffle.

1397
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,649
Did you get her an engagement gift?

1398
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:36,618
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together.
We're just friends.

1399
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:40,856
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewelry.

1400
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,125
The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.

1401
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,862
I don't care how upset she is,
I get her jewelry, she lights right up.

1402
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,497
Where is she, anyway?

1403
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,901
-She's not here, Dad.
-I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

1404
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,506
-She's not coming.
-Why not?

1405
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,743
She doesn't live with you anymore, Pop.
You're not married.

1406
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,012
-What?
-She left about 10 years ago.

1407
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,414
I don't understand.

1408
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,649
She divorced you, Dad.

1409
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:11,987
-I have to call her.
-Dad, you can't.

1410
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,622
Stop telling me what to do.

1411
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,492
Get your...

1412
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,430
Grandpa!

1413
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,831
Dylan, get...

1414
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,400
-You okay, Dad?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

1415
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,835
-Here, let me help you up.
-No, don't. Don't!

1416
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,669
Here we are.

1417
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,939
This is beautiful.

1418
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,842
Yeah, this is where I used to come to think.
My rooftop.

1419
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,544
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

1420
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,078
I'm a little over 6 foot.

1421
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:13,615
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

1422
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,218
Ninety-two feet.

1423
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:20,122
-Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right?
-Yeah.

1424
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:24,660
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

1425
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:28,564
-Wait. Six times three...
-Oh, God, you poor kid.

1426
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,133
-What's up?
-Come on.

1427
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,135
What? What? Where are you going?

1428
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,572
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

1429
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:37,673
Look at all the cameras.

1430
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,043
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

1431
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,179
And if any of these cameras are hooked up
to the actual Scientology Center,

1432
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,148
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

1433
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,917
I believe in the freedom of science fiction.

1434
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,020
Pussy! Oh, sorry.

1435
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,155
Pussy!

1436
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,723
Come on!

1437
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,799
-You really never been up here before?
-No.

1438
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,235
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

1439
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,170
'cause it's against the law.

1440
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:12,274
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

1441
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,142
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?

1442
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,745
She's not worth talking about.

1443
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,280
That's rough.

1444
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,048
So is leaving your husband and kids.

1445
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,151
Yeah, you never told me about him either.

1446
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,187
You know, there's a lot of stuff
you didn't tell me.

1447
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,955
I don't want your pity.

1448
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:32,160
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

1449
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,633
-That one.
-Who cares what anybody thinks?

1450
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,303
He's the smartest man I've ever known.
He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

1451
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:42,804
He's my dad.

1452
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,239
Dylan, he's still the same man.

1453
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:45,774
When I see the way people look at him now...

1454
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,011
It doesn't matter how people look at him.

1455
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,279
All that matters is how you look at him.

1456
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,215
Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

1457
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,983
-So what?
-It's embarrassing.

1458
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,785
He needs to know that nothing has changed.

1459
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,787
That he's still that same man to you.

1460
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,923
Can we stop talking about this?

1461
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,727
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

1462
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,929
I'm trying not to.

1463
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:12,000
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

1464
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,069
-No, I haven't.
-Yeah, you have.

1465
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,938
Is this about what happened the other night?

1466
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,140
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

1467
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,344
Right.

1468
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,813
-And I haven't been acting weird.
-Okay.

1469
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,850
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, shit!

1470
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,886
-I told you!
-Well, I'm sorry!

1471
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:31,987
Fuck!

1472
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,123
This is the LAPD. You are trespassing.
Get down from the sign.

1473
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,358
We gotta jump.

1474
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,796
-Dylan, jump!
-I'm frozen.

1475
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:41,930
Come on, get down!

1476
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,098
Sir, this is your last warning.

1477
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,367
-Use the ladder!
-I have a fear of heights!

1478
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:50,339
And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

1479
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:52,908
What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

1480
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,776
Why would you come up here?

1481
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,312
You called me a pussy!

1482
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,017
A bizarre situation
this afternoon in the Southland.

1483
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,754
The LAPD rescued a local man
from the Hollywood sign,

1484
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,856
the city's only real landmark.

1485
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,125
They actually wrapped you in a foil blanket!

1486
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,893
Did you run a marathon before this?

1487
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,395
-Okay. Give me...
-No!

1488
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,897
-No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it.
-No. That's enough!

1489
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,166
-Give me the remote! Shut up!
-No, I wanna watch it over and over.

1490
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,901
Foil wrapper...

1491
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,169
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1492
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,939
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.

1493
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,910
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week
I have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?

1494
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,147
-Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York.
-Oh, good.

1495
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,183
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?

1496
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,818
I don't know.

1497
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,187
What's your problem?
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

1498
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,289
She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

1499
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,859
I would believe you if you didn't lie to me.

1500
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,961
I saw you creeping out of her room
the other night.

1501
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,096
Like you had just had sex,
if you know what I mean.

1502
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,065
Yes, I know what you mean, you just said it.

1503
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,300
And how do you know
what I look like after I have...

1504
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,804
I'm not talking to you about this, okay?
We're not together.

1505
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,340
-Dylan.
-Enough! I'm not talking about it.

1506
01:17:58,707 --> 01:17:59,908
Dylan.

1507
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,111
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.

1508
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,183
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.

1509
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,420
Friends who have sex?
What are you, in college?

1510
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,455
-It doesn't matter, it's over.
-Why?

1511
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,290
Because we don't like each other like that.

1512
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,360
Okay, you know what?
Can we just talk about this? Sit down.

1513
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,095
What more are you looking for?

1514
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,197
-Who says I'm looking for anything?
-Dylan.

1515
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,467
-I don't know, but it's not Jamie.
-Why, because you're great together?

1516
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,369
Because you're actually
friends with each other?

1517
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,005
Because this is the happiest
I have ever seen you?

1518
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,974
I don't know what to tell you.
She's not for me. I don't like her like that.

1519
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:36,445
-You liked her enough to have sex with her.
-It's just physical.

1520
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,414
-Like playing tennis.
-I don't even know what that means, Dylan.

1521
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:42,117
I haven't seen you this dumb
since you got that candy corn tattoo.

1522
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,453
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!

1523
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,822
Dylan, you can't name
one thing that's wrong with her.

1524
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:50,025
I can never go out with her.
She's too fucked up.

1525
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,027
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.

1526
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,228
She's too damaged.

1527
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,363
Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on in her head.

1528
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,833
Wow. You'll say anything right now

1529
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,367
not to admit that
you're perfect for each other.

1530
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,369
-Why am I still having this conversation?
-Because I'm right.

1531
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,238
-Good talk, Annie.
-Dylan.

1532
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,427
I don't think the three-point line
would have done anything.

1533
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,329
-He was taller than anyone alive.
-No, but it helped Kobe.

1534
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:28,964
-Kobe Bryant is incredible.
-It helped him.

1535
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,334
-You're men. You like sports. You're men.
-Scored 81 points. Please.

1536
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,336
Hey! We were waiting for you.

1537
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,071
I actually got a call from work.

1538
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,939
I have to be on a red eye tonight
back to New York.

1539
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,541
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

1540
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,010
-Tomorrow's the 4th.
-I know, it sucks.

1541
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,411
Well, at least let me drive you to the airport.

1542
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:46,515
No, no. It's fine. Stay.
I already called a cab. It's out front.

1543
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,817
But thank you guys for everything.

1544
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,553
And thank you for letting me stay here.
It's been pretty great.

1545
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,057
-Hey.
-Hey.

1546
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:59,060
-Everything okay, buddy?
-Yeah, buddy. Everything's great.

1547
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,428
I just really gotta go.

1548
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,366
So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.

1549
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,201
-Let Dylan drive you.
-Yeah.

1550
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:09,171
-Do you wanna take some food to go?
-Do you want me to saw you in half?

1551
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,507
You can send your bottom part to New York
and your top half can stay here.

1552
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:17,045
Or the whole of you could stay.

1553
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,947
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1554
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:32,594
Jamie!

1555
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,838
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.

1556
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,380
-We should eat. You hungry, buddy?
-Yeah.

1557
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,217
Okay. Hand me your plate.

1558
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:28,283
Hey, bro. You hungry?
'Cause I'm going to get something to eat.

1559
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,386
Thanks, man.
I think I'm just gonna work through lunch.

1560
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:36,591
A work ethic. I love it.
That is why this country is still number one.

1561
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:41,062
Well, behind Germany and France
and Belgium and Japan and China and...

1562
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,598
Thank God for Bangladesh.

1563
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,969
By the way, why did you take
your door off its lovely hinges?

1564
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,405
It was dumb, man.
Something I saw in a management book.

1565
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:54,309
Oh, right, right.
Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.

1566
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,177
He took doors off of things.

1567
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,246
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.

1568
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,216
My guidebook is very simple.
You wanna lose weight?

1569
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,450
Stop eating, fatty.

1570
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,652
You wanna make money?

1571
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,921
Work your ass off, lazy.

1572
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:07,088
You wanna be happy?

1573
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:09,357
Find someone you like and never let him go.

1574
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,560
Or her, if you're into that kind of creepy shit.

1575
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,009
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now,

1576
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,578
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

1577
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:40,722
Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen.
You gotta tell it where you are.

1578
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,960
Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.

1579
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:52,300
Booty call.
I can take a walk around the block.

1580
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,036
No, no. Nope, that's okay.

1581
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,738
This is your apartment.
I don't wanna twat-block you.

1582
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,609
That's Dylan, right?

1583
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,545
-He seemed pretty great.
-You met him once.

1584
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,513
Well, that's more than
anybody else you've dated.

1585
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,750
I don't know, you think maybe I keep
my worlds apart for some crazy reason?

1586
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,497
I am an asshole.

1587
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,267
We're looking for someone
to lead the redesign of our entire website.

1588
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,136
Someone to turn it completely upside down.

1589
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,005
But you can't tell me
what company you work for?

1590
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,507
For confidentiality reasons, no.

1591
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,775
Can you give me a hint?

1592
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:38,079
We may or may not be the largest seller
of purchased goods on the Internet.

1593
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,448
And by "purchased goods," I mean books.

1594
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,418
You just placed the new art director
over at GQ, right?

1595
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,519
Yeah.

1596
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,522
That's the type of guy we want.
Shoot, that's the guy we want.

1597
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:48,656
Can you get him to come out to us?

1598
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,160
No longer have a relationship with him.

1599
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,130
-Can you get to him?
-He's still in the first year of his contract,

1600
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,565
so that would be inappropriate.

1601
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,701
So is paying full price
for a book at Barnes &amp; Noble,

1602
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,136
but people do dumb shit.

1603
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:07,242
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now,

1604
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,411
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

1605
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:12,547
Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.

1606
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,161
Jamie.

1607
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,331
How'd you know I was up here?

1608
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,401
Only place in the city
you don't get reception.

1609
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:34,702
Right.

1610
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,105
-Why are you avoiding me?
-I'm not.

1611
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,307
Really? Come on, Jamie.

1612
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:43,445
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard,
but I am seriously fucked up.

1613
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:48,183
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on up here.

1614
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,386
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
-But I'm just gonna go

1615
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:54,722
and try to fix the shit going on up
in my head, if that's even possible.

1616
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:59,194
I shouldn't have said that.
I was just trying to get my sister off my back.

1617
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,463
-She thought we liked each other.
-Yeah, me, too, Dylan.

1618
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,564
I thought we were friends.

1619
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:05,300
But friends don't go
talking shit about each other,

1620
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,670
which must mean that you and I
were actually never friends.

1621
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:12,273
-That all you wanted was to get in my pants.
-What?

1622
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,509
You jumped at the chance
at your dad's house.

1623
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:15,643
You cracked your neck.

1624
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,812
I thought you were giving me a sign.
We talked about this.

1625
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,347
Oh, my God, really?

1626
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,649
You pulled my robe off.
"Oopsy." Remember?

1627
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,885
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.

1628
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,353
"Oopsy." Remember that?

1629
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:29,357
Are you pissed off at me
because I didn't cuddle?

1630
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:35,296
Isn't that why we started
this whole arrangement in the first place?

1631
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,165
You wanted this.

1632
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,369
I wanted this?

1633
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:43,638
Just me?

1634
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:47,308
God, you are just like every other guy.

1635
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:50,211
The sad thing is, Dylan,
I actually thought you were different.

1636
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,514
Different from what?
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.

1637
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,517
Well, with friends like you,
who needs friends?

1638
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,657
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.

1639
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:04,792
Asshole.

1640
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,701
Hey, man, you can't be up here.

1641
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,737
Okay.

1642
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,706
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

1643
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,468
Bryce, is this for me?

1644
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,205
Yeah. And so is this.

1645
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,974
Madison, will you marry me?

1646
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,376
You bet your ass, Flapjack!

1647
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,781
-I love New York.
-I love you.

1648
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,483
Oh, my God.
Look, the Empire State Building.

1649
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:03,751
Wow.

1650
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,520
Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.

1651
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,329
Hello, this is Jamie.

1652
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:17,932
What do you mean they went to him directly?

1653
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,602
Well, is he gonna take it?

1654
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:23,771
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it.
I'll call him right now.

1655
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,006
Okay.

1656
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,612
Hey, this is Dylan. Leave a message.

1657
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,655
Excuse me. May I help you?

1658
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,824
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?

1659
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,626
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.

1660
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:48,429
That's right. The photo shoot.
Where was that again?

1661
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,697
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1662
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:51,633
One of the models.

1663
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,502
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

1664
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:58,539
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

1665
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,908
and this gets way more Christian.

1666
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:03,578
So where did you say he was again?

1667
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,949
Sports is the last chance we have
of bringing our world together, bro.

1668
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,286
So I just wanted to shoot some photos
that speak to that,

1669
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:13,655
to the unification of all people
through sports.

1670
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,290
Okay, guys. Let's go.

1671
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,924
That's it.

1672
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,726
Beautiful.

1673
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,595
Okay, now put your arms around each other,

1674
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,964
like you like each other,
like you love each other.

1675
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,667
-Too gay?
-A little bit.

1676
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,935
Throw some girls in there.

1677
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:30,538
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

1678
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:35,443
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.

1679
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,945
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy...

1680
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,947
-Dylan.
-...boy, boy, boy, boys.

1681
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,650
-What are you doing here?
-You met for another job!

1682
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:45,520
-What, are you gonna leave now?
-I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.

1683
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,955
-I can't believe you.
-Come here.

1684
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,025
-Is this your way of getting back at me?
-What?

1685
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,428
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

1686
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,962
Oh, right.

1687
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,431
If I did leave,

1688
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,367
which I don't know yet
because all I did was take one meeting,

1689
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,336
I'd write you a check for your bonus.

1690
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,872
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1691
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:07,408
-Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
-That's personal.

1692
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,744
And we're not friends anymore.
You made that pretty clear.

1693
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:14,916
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

1694
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:17,352
Pretend you were the best friend I'd ever had.

1695
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,120
Open up to you
like I've never done with anyone ever.

1696
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:22,857
And then when the sex stopped,
invite you to LA for the weekend

1697
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:25,893
to introduce you to my family.

1698
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:29,864
-I'll send you a check if I take the job.
-Don't bother.

1699
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,938
Why don't you pick him up?

1700
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,941
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

1701
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:42,477
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!

1702
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,870
-Hey, Dyl.
-Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?

1703
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:10,772
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

1704
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,741
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

1705
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,511
so he gets in at 32:00?

1706
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:19,647
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

1707
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,816
Right. How is Dad?

1708
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,920
He's lost more often than not now.

1709
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:29,023
But then he has these moments
of real clarity. It's hit or miss.

1710
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,458
-Okay.
-How's Jamie?

1711
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,529
-That's over.
-Oh, Dylan!

1712
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,665
-Okay, we're done.
-Don't be an idiot, please.

1713
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,034
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

1714
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,936
-32:00 sharp.
-I love you.

1715
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:46,941
I don't know what it is.

1716
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,644
I just can't get myself
to start looking for a replacement for him,

1717
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:50,778
assuming that he leaves.

1718
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:54,015
-Do you want some motherly love advice?
-Not really.

1719
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,883
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know
how to do that.

1720
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:59,620
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

1721
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:02,456
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.

1722
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,625
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.

1723
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:07,829
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

1724
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,096
-Eighty.
-One.

1725
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,965
-Eighty-one?
-One.

1726
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,668
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.

1727
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,469
Obviously. Look at you.

1728
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,706
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

1729
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,074
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.

1730
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,977
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.

1731
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:25,479
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

1732
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,849
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

1733
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,684
Or is it like a coping mechanism?

1734
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,586
-A little of both.
-Okay.

1735
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,121
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.

1736
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:38,993
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming,
you just gotta know him when you see him.

1737
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,696
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

1738
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,966
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming
to rescue you in a horse and carriage.

1739
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,767
That's not who you want.

1740
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:50,805
I mean, you're looking for a man
to be your partner.

1741
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,274
To take on the world with.

1742
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,210
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.

1743
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:58,779
My Prince Charming?

1744
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:00,815
You.

1745
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:02,016
Mom.

1746
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,909
-Hey.
-A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.

1747
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,644
-How was the flight?
-I'm hungry.

1748
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:31,312
You know they don't serve food
in coach anymore?

1749
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:33,814
You'd think with these new planes,
they practically fly themselves,

1750
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,317
they could get rid of a pilot
and use his salary for a hot lunch.

1751
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,986
-I know, right? Let's get you some food.
-God.

1752
01:32:39,553 --> 01:32:41,689
The engineering on these planes
is so advanced.

1753
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:42,924
Completely computerized.

1754
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,059
-It's like playing a video game.
-Exactly.

1755
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:48,062
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

1756
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:50,231
I'll be right back, okay?

1757
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,069
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.

1758
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:56,904
-Harper.
-Yeah, I got you. I got you.

1759
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,673
I have to seat people in the order they came.

1760
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:00,708
I totally understand that, but I'm with my dad

1761
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:02,710
-and he's not in the best shape.
-I'm sorry.

1762
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,679
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

1763
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,615
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.

1764
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:12,687
Dad?

1765
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,695
Dad?

1766
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,364
Shit. Dad?

1767
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:37,712
You gonna join me?

1768
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,990
Absolutely.

1769
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:55,363
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry, you cannot do this.

1770
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,798
Could I get a steak, medium, please?

1771
01:33:57,932 --> 01:33:59,867
-Sir, this is the Daily Grill.
-Make that two.

1772
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,311
Dede? Dede!

1773
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:20,421
Dad.

1774
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:22,289
Dad.

1775
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,228
Who is Dede?

1776
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:32,299
Jesus. She's just a girl that I met in the Navy.

1777
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:34,902
Was...

1778
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:38,973
She was the love of my life.

1779
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:41,675
Okay?

1780
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,045
Why didn't you tell me about her before?

1781
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:47,014
This is not something
you discuss with your children.

1782
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,984
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

1783
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:51,118
So tell me now.

1784
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,789
She was the love of my life.

1785
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,090
And I was too stupid to realize it,

1786
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:59,260
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

1787
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:01,395
And I never really got over her.

1788
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:05,866
And I think that may be
one of the reasons your mom left.

1789
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:10,471
You know, my friends used to say that
when Dede and I looked at each other,

1790
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:11,906
it was electric.

1791
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,207
And I let her go.

1792
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:14,975
I just let her go.

1793
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:18,712
Because I was too damn proud
to tell her how I really felt about her.

1794
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,949
I'll tell you something that I wish
I knew when I was your age.

1795
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,918
And I know you've heard
a million times, "life is short."

1796
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:27,455
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

1797
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:30,858
is that life is goddamn short
and you can't waste a minute of it.

1798
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,229
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1799
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:43,471
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

1800
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,307
-Yeah, what's going on with her?
-I think I messed it up.

1801
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,375
-Fix it.
-She won't talk to me.

1802
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,911
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

1803
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:55,749
If you think there's even a chance
that she could be it, you fix it.

1804
01:35:57,852 --> 01:35:59,053
Did Annie put you up to this?

1805
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:00,988
Who's Annie?

1806
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,523
I'm kidding.

1807
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,059
What, I can't joke about this?

1808
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:07,761
-Jesus Christ, Dad.
-I don't know what else to do.

1809
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,531
Let's go.

1810
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:13,033
You don't want to finish your steak?

1811
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:16,036
We're eating in the goddamn airport.
I can leave the steak. Come on.

1812
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:20,374
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ.
We met a few weeks ago at the...

1813
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,043
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?

1814
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,846
-I am so sorry, sir.
-It's my fault.

1815
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,348
-You just scared me.
-No, no. My fault. You all right?

1816
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,016
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Here, let me help you with that.

1817
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,785
-Thanks, man. You're really nice.
-All right. Hey, safe travels.

1818
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:33,287
-All right, thanks, man.
-Okay, thank you.

1819
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:37,958
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

1820
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:40,828
-What's your problem with me?
-I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

1821
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:44,498
How could such an awesome girl
be with this over this?

1822
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,169
I've been trying to take that little monkey
to pound-town for years.

1823
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,437
-I'll tell her you say hello.
-What?

1824
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:52,806
You missed a little. There you go.

1825
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,408
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

1826
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,010
I ever run into you again,

1827
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,445
I'll crush your earlobes
and make soup stock out of them.

1828
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:00,548
-You have a vivid imagination.
-I do!

1829
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:03,083
-I'm gonna get in the cab now.
-I'm gonna go make soup!

1830
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:05,085
-What's the matter with her?
-I don't know.

1831
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:12,459
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

1832
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:13,994
Is there another way into the city?

1833
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,373
I owe you big time, Tommy.

1834
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:30,978
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

1835
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:35,616
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

1836
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,085
-You okay, Dad?
-Are you kidding?

1837
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:41,422
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

1838
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:42,623
Nice.

1839
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,127
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at...

1840
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:50,297
Right. Can I ask you a huge favor?

1841
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,171
My number. Here's the remote.

1842
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:00,474
My friend Dave from across the hall,
his oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

1843
01:38:00,608 --> 01:38:04,044
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen
or watching me?

1844
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,646
Go.

1845
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,381
-Holy...
-What?

1846
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:09,383
"How to wear white pants to a cookout."

1847
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:12,586
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

1848
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:14,388
All right, all right.

1849
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,056
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

1850
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,392
See you, Dad.

1851
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,995
Thanks, man.

1852
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:22,896
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

1853
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:26,567
Hi, Mr. Harper. How are you?

1854
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:29,136
And now we know why you're here.

1855
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:33,574
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

1856
01:38:33,907 --> 01:38:35,943
I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.

1857
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:39,546
-There are a million guys in ties.
-So look for the guy I'm standing next to.

1858
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,549
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

1859
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:44,318
Just hang on, baby.

1860
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:50,090
What?

1861
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:54,261
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it after all.

1862
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:56,430
Something came up. Let's meet tomorrow.

1863
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:59,633
I'll be on the stairs. Right across from you.

1864
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,572
Oh, my God.

1865
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:07,441
Have a great night, baby.

1866
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,362
What is this?

1867
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:31,231
It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!

1868
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,667
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

1869
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,603
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

1870
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:38,972
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

1871
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,410
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central
instead of the fake one.

1872
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:51,251
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

1873
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:53,454
I'm having trouble hearing you!

1874
01:39:53,587 --> 01:39:55,422
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

1875
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:57,758
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

1876
01:39:58,092 --> 01:39:59,393
and they put the music in later.

1877
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:00,661
What?

1878
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:05,232
I messed up.

1879
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:07,634
I was scared.

1880
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,237
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

1881
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:11,438
Of course I was scared.

1882
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:13,640
So I ruined it.

1883
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,577
Everything that happens in the day,

1884
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,013
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

1885
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:24,118
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

1886
01:40:24,785 --> 01:40:29,423
And when I hear a kid's been cured of cancer,
I pray it's not by that douchebag,

1887
01:40:29,556 --> 01:40:32,459
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

1888
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:37,164
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,
but, you know, I wish someone else did it.

1889
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,299
Come on.

1890
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:46,540
Hey, I miss you.

1891
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:48,542
Yeah, I miss you, too.

1892
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,677
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

1893
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,180
So am I. Who isn't?

1894
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:55,282
That's what makes us so awesome.

1895
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,151
-And our tattoos.
-Yeah.

1896
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:01,688
-No, no, no.
-Shut up. It's not what you think.

1897
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:04,691
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

1898
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:08,162
-That is so lame.
-I know.

1899
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:10,764
That's some Prince Charming shit,
though, right?

1900
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:12,232
-Get up.
-Okay.

1901
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,070
Look, I can live without
ever having sex with you again.

1902
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,239
It'd be really hard.

1903
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:22,476
Hey, I want my best friend back,

1904
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:24,578
because I'm in love with her.

1905
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:27,848
-Under one condition.
-Anything.

1906
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,185
Kiss me.

1907
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,355
-In public? In front of all these people?
-I did not ask you to...

1908
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,877
You can all go home now.

1909
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:05,252
Okay. So...

1910
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:10,357
-What do we do now?
-Have our first date.

1911
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:11,758
Okay.

1912
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:18,165
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

1913
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:20,901
Yeah, that's not for you.

1914
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:24,304
Oh, thank God.
Horses actually scare the shit out of me.

1915
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:25,639
-Really?
-Yeah.

1916
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:27,140
So, where are you from?

1917
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:29,676
-Outside of Philly, actually.
-Interesting.

1918
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:33,480
-I'm from LA, just moved to New York.
-Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.

1919
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:36,817
What? I'm excited, I'm on a first date. So...

1920
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:39,386
This isn't weird at all.

1921
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,655
-We're okay.
-Yeah. Thank you.

1922
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:45,659
So...

1923
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:49,796
Yeah, fuck it.

1924
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:04,838
Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits.
And here come the outtakes.

1925
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:08,642
Because if the actors had
a good time making it, it must be good.

1926
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:10,644
You bet your ass, Jason.

1927
01:49:11,111 --> 01:49:13,613
Oh, my God, I just called him Jason.

1928
01:49:13,747 --> 01:49:15,315
Look, the crew's laughing.

1929
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:19,219
They made me do it! They made me do it.

1930
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,321
It's my favorite part.
