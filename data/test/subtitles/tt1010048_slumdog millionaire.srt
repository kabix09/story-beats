1
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:34,786
Name?

2
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:52,354
Good evening! Namaskaar,
Sasrakaar, Aadaam.

3
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:57,362
Welcome to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"!

4
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:00,686
Are you ready?

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Yes.

6
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:06,265
<i>Please give a big round of applause,</i>

7
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
Good Luck Kid.
<i>To a very first contestant of the night,</i>

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,942
Jamal Malik from our very own,
Aarmchi Mumbay!

9
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,599
Hello, let's play.

10
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,114
Smile, you'll be fine.

11
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,451
Name.

12
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:37,473
Motherfucker, name?

13
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,551
Jamal. Malik.

14
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:41,050
You have a name.

15
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:43,790
Good. Stop, crying.

16
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:46,976
Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,697
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, very much.

18
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,149
So Jamal...

19
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:55,492
tell me something about yourself.

20
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,282
I work in a call-center...

21
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,900
in Juhu.
Good.

22
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,949
A phone basher..

23
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,283
And what type of call-center
should that be?

24
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,207
XL5 mobile phones.

25
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,616
So you are the one who calls me up

26
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,492
every single day of my life
with special offers?

27
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,483
No, actually I am an assistant.

28
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,447
An assistant phone basher?

29
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,681
And what does an assistant
phone basher do exactly?

30
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,200
I get tea for people and...

31
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,613
Chaiwalla?

32
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,070
A chaiwalla!

33
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,147
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,507
Jamal Malik...
one who serves hot tea from Mumbay,

35
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:47,105
let's play "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"

36
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:59,345
So, has he confessed yet?

37
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,346
Except his name I could not get
anything out of the runt.

38
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,164
You have been here the whole
bloody night, Srinivas.

39
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,480
What have you been doing?

40
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,246
He's a tough guy.

41
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,379
A little electricity will
loosen his tongue, give him.

42
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:12,585
Yes sir.

43
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,378
Ok, so were you wired up?

44
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,644
Mobile phone or a pager?

45
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,378
Or coughing accomplice in the audience?

46
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,754
Or microchip under your skin?

47
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,744
The chip is not here.
Not here?

48
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,186
No.
Ok, leave it.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,782
Leave it. Leave it.

50
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,275
It's hot, and my wife is giving me hell.

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,718
I've got a desk full of murderers,

52
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:54,812
rapists,

53
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,635
extortionists, bomb bandits,

54
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,912
and you.

55
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:04,504
So why don't you save us
both a lot of time?

56
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,893
And tell me how you cheated?

57
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,893
I'm done sir.

58
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,793
Now listen.

59
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,825
Hello!

60
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,424
He's is unconscious, fucker.
What good is that?

61
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,102
How many times have I told you,
you should once...

62
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,426
I'm sorry sir.

63
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:48,540
Good, good, good Srinivas...

64
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,110
Now we'll have Amnesty
International here next

65
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,977
peeing in their pants about human rights.

66
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:54,339
Sir I was thinking...

67
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,776
Get him down, tidy him up please.
For God's sake!

68
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,140
Sir, what if he did know the answers?

69
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,369
Professors, doctors, lawyers,

70
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,708
general knowledge-wallas never
get beyond 60000 rupees.

71
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,340
He's on 10 million.

72
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,274
What the hell can a slumdog possibly know?

73
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,908
The answers!

74
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,073
I knew the answers...

75
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,929
If the planes won't kill you, we will!

76
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:29,405
Repeat it!
"You have sent for me, Sir?" said Athos.

77
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,757
So...

78
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,571
Mr. Malik,

79
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,413
the man who knows all the answers.

80
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,429
Talk.

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,514
Whoreson talk!

82
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:27,725
<i>So Jamal,</i>

83
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,906
<i>are you ready for the first
question, for 1000 rupees?</i>

84
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,697
<i>Yes.</i>

85
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:36,326
<i>Not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.</i>

86
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,062
<i>Better than making tea, no?</i>

87
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,328
No. Yes. No.

88
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,760
No? Yes? No?

89
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,475
Is that your final answer?

90
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,988
So remember.

91
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,673
You have three lifelines.

92
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,219
Ask the audience.

93
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,033
50/50.

94
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:55,825
Call a friend.

95
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,020
So the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.

96
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:04,817
Who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "Zanjeer"?

97
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,062
Amitabh!

98
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,809
Amitabh Bachchan!

99
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,800
Yea, got Amithab's autograph!

100
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,314
A. Amitabh Bachchan.

101
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,336
Guess what, you're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

102
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,830
You don't have to be a genius.

103
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,223
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

104
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,852
Like I said, you do not
have to be a genius.

105
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,254
He's the most famous man in India.

106
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,866
<i>A picture of three lions,</i>

107
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,527
<i>as seen on the national emblem of India.</i>

108
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:30,787
<i>What is written underneath?</i>

109
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:51,813
What do you think, Jamal?

110
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:56,257
The most famous phrase of our country.

111
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:57,998
Do you like to call a friend?

112
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,311
Ask the audience.

113
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:04,112
<i>Put the poor man out of his
misery, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

114
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:07,345
My five-year old daughter
can answer that question,

115
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,732
but you couldn't.

116
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:11,568
That's strange for a millionaire genius.

117
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:13,830
What happened?

118
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:17,146
Your accomplice sneaked out for a piss?

119
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,209
The inspector is asking something.

120
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:23,477
How much is panipuri at
Dharisha store on Chowpatty?

121
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,485
What?

122
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,797
Panipuri.

123
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,389
One plate, how much?

124
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,879
10 rupees.
Wrong.

125
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,666
15 since Diwali.

126
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,979
Who stole Constable Varmy's bicycle

127
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,693
outside Santa Cruz station last Thursday?

128
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,750
You know who that was?

129
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,145
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

130
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,898
Even five year old.

131
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,996
Congratulations, Jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.

132
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,327
A 16 thousand rupees.

133
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:05,996
Religion.

134
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,333
Interesting.

135
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,659
In depictions of God Rama,

136
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,711
he is famously holding what in his right hand?

137
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:53,474
I wake up every morning wishing I did
not know the answer to that question.

138
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,834
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

139
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,760
I would still have a mother.

140
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,683
A bow and arrow.

141
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:17,661
Final answer?

142
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,387
Final answer.

143
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,903
Computer-ji, lock D.

144
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,881
You just won 16000 rupees.

145
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:37,791
Well done, my friend.

146
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,455
Time for commercial break.
Don't go away, now.

147
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,999
You got lucky, huh?

148
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,693
If I were you I'd take the money and run.

149
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:52,398
You're not going to the next one.

150
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,468
Welcome back to
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"

151
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:31,026
Our contestant, Jamal Malik,
call-center assistant from Mumbay,

152
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,900
is on 16 thousand rupees,

153
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,346
and has already used only one
lifeline, ask the audience.

154
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,331
So my friend,

155
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,575
you're into serious money.

156
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,838
Yes.

157
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,842
A: Surdas.

158
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,099
B: Tulsidas.

159
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,931
C: Mira Bai.

160
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,437
D: Kabir.

161
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:04,333
Hello.

162
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,166
It's hot, huh?

163
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,666
Here son.

164
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:23,936
Arvind.

165
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,217
Salim.

166
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:48,477
No.

167
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,178
Just give...

168
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:04,692
Come.

169
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,166
Surdas.

170
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:41,210
Surdas?

171
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:45,763
Surdas,

172
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,412
is your final answer?

173
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,374
Yes.

174
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:57,605
Guess what,

175
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,173
you're right!

176
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:14,938
What happened to a girl?
They blinded her too?

177
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:19,893
They had other plans.

178
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:24,227
Well it took me a long time to find out.

179
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:40,840
Is this heaven?

180
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,926
You are not dead, Jamal.

181
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,523
What is it?

182
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:52,707
Some hotel huh?

183
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:58,507
The Taj Mahal is considered the
finest example of Mugal architecture.

184
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:09,004
Taj Mahal was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.

185
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:14,913
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited as the...

186
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:51,744
Please, please.

187
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,768
What time is the next tour?

188
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,193
We are on tight schedule, you see.

189
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,405
Have to see the Red Fort this afternoon.

190
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:02,067
Please, would it be possible
to show us up round now?

191
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:07,349
Obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.

192
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,627
But of course madam!

193
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,741
Please follow me.

194
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:18,232
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurrama

195
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:23,566
for his wife Mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.

196
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:29,269
Then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,

197
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:32,231
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.

198
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:35,218
But he died in 1587,

199
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:38,979
before any of the rooms were
built, or any of the lifts.

200
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:46,066
But this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.

201
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:48,832
Is says nothing of this in the guide book.

202
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:54,267
The guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

203
00:43:56,899 --> 00:43:59,003
And this lady and gentlemen,

204
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,779
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

205
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:04,429
How did she die?

206
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:07,765
A road traffic accident.
Really?

207
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:09,931
Maximum pile-up.

208
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:13,430
I thought she died in childbirth.

209
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:16,015
Exactly sir.

210
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,977
She was on the way to
hospital when it happened.

211
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:27,511
Ready?

212
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,408
Smile.

213
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:38,548
Shoes!

214
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:41,244
American brands!
Shoes!

215
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:57,533
It's high temperature?

216
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:03,454
Smile.

217
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:23,162
This, Mr David, is the biggest
Dhobi Ghat in the whole of India.

218
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:24,627
That's amazing.

219
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:28,061
Come on, take a real good look at this.

220
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,927
They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh

221
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:37,361
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

222
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:48,501
Move it around! Pit-stop's god
speed! Schumacher's style!

223
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,269
There are the cows or are those buffaloes.
What are those over there?

224
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,767
Go, go. Let's run!

225
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:04,124
Oh, shit.

226
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,225
What the hell happened here?

227
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:06,226
Motherfucker!

228
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:12,927
Ok, that's enough!

229
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:16,223
Ok. Hold it!
Hold it, will you.

230
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,260
You've got the insurance don't you?

231
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:19,415
Are you ok?

232
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,044
You wanted to see a bit of real India?

233
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:23,267
Here it is!

234
00:46:23,455 --> 00:46:24,556
Al right!

235
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,535
Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

236
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:30,893
Oh, yes, yes! Jesus...

237
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,292
Here.

238
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,653
On an American 100 dollar bill,

239
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:26,576
there's a portrait of which
American statesman?

240
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:48,016
Pay or play, Jamal?

241
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:50,888
You decide.

242
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:55,351
Oh god he's looking at the camera.
He hasn't got a clue.

243
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:58,070
This is gonna be a walk away.
Stand by.

244
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,450
No, he's gonna play with him first.

245
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:03,617
<i>Jamal?</i>

246
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,900
Get a lot of 100 dollar bills
in your in your line of work?

247
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:11,717
A minimum tip for my services.

248
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:16,250
Oh, now I know why my
cellphone bills are so high.

249
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,251
They tip the chaiwalla with 100 dollar bills.

250
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,766
It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

251
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:24,516
<i>You're gonna play, huh?</i>

252
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,248
<i>I think I've just had, hadn't I?</i>

253
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,766
<i>So you exactly have C, right?</i>

254
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:31,150
Who's on 1,000 rupee note?

255
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,346
I don't know.

256
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,853
You don't know?

257
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:38,775
Ghandi-ji.

258
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,469
I have heard of him.

259
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,549
Don't get clever

260
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,048
or I'll get the electricity out again.

261
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:50,783
Look.

262
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:53,438
They didn't ask me that question.

263
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:55,160
I don't know why.

264
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:57,113
Ask them.

265
00:49:57,248 --> 00:50:00,347
It's funny, you don't seem
like you're interested in money.

266
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,256
<i>By the fact you have...</i>

267
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,965
<i>one million rupees!</i>

268
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:16,149
Explain the 100 dollar bill.

269
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:21,792
Bombay had turned name to Mumbay.

270
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:27,102
Why don't you understand?

271
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,832
Two chicken burgers, two fries,
one mango rassi, one coke!

272
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,594
One mineral water!

273
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:44,320
Shimla.

274
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,582
I'm going to Chowpatty, ok?

275
00:51:48,996 --> 00:51:50,245
Wanna come?

276
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,253
For god's sake,

277
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:55,043
you've got some disease?

278
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,661
You're forcing back to this shithole.

279
00:51:57,796 --> 00:52:00,242
We leave our friends, a good life,

280
00:52:00,476 --> 00:52:03,360
lots of money. For this?

281
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:04,909
We came back to find her.

282
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:07,542
You did.
I don't give a shit about her.

283
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:10,643
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

284
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:12,309
Oh yes sir!

285
00:52:12,644 --> 00:52:15,042
You should come back to
the Cages on Saturday night,

286
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:18,540
instead of ghost searching
for your lost love.

287
00:52:19,275 --> 00:52:21,058
I'm going to Chowpatty.

288
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:23,408
I'm going to Chowpatty!

289
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,541
There are 19 million
people in this city, Jamal.

290
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,442
Forget about her.

291
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:32,429
She is a street.

292
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,467
Benjamin Franklin.

293
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,203
I'm sorry...

294
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:15,117
Thanks.

295
00:54:34,535 --> 00:54:35,535
Know Cherry?

296
00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:49,473
Where can we found Cherry?

297
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,991
You want Cherry?

298
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:52,446
Get lost! Go home.

299
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,833
Where's Cherry?

300
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,734
Cherry?
Inside.

301
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:47,217
So, is it her or not?

302
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:56,481
She's sexy, man!

303
00:55:56,782 --> 00:55:57,783
Get on, Latika!

304
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:04,296
Who is this?
Jamal?

305
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:06,191
I'll get the bags.
Who are you?

306
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:07,230
What do you want?

307
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:09,631
You stupid boys!
Pack it in! Put that.

308
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,067
How did you find me?

309
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,265
Later, later...

310
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:18,496
Take the cash. Come on!

311
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:19,641
Come on. We got it.

312
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:20,859
Let's go! Let's go!

313
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,119
Shit.

314
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:26,760
Look who we have here!

315
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:30,375
Hello again.

316
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:32,337
Jamal,

317
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,223
Salim.

318
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:38,077
I never forget a face.

319
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:40,195
Right Punnoose?

320
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,048
Especially one that I own.

321
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:51,929
You really thought you could just
walk in and take my prize away?

322
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,557
Latika, come.

323
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:03,456
Have you any idea how much
this little virgin is worth?

324
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:04,812
Sisterfucker!

325
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:08,235
Please continue, Master-ji.
Ok, sir.

326
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:09,896
Get them out of here!
No!

327
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:20,067
Move! Get over there!

328
00:57:21,228 --> 00:57:23,527
Let's not be foolish, Salim.

329
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:28,246
Heavy, isn't it?

330
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,725
Give it to me.

331
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:31,898
On your knees!

332
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:33,212
Down!

333
00:57:35,777 --> 00:57:37,027
Both of you! Down!

334
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:42,990
Money!

335
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:46,092
You can have money,

336
00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:48,094
here.

337
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Look.

338
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:57,425
Take it.

339
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:01,940
Go, disappear with your friend
and we'll forget all about this, ok?

340
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:04,837
Maman never forgets.

341
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:07,377
Isn't that right?

342
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:09,968
Oh, Maman can make an exception.

343
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:14,210
I can't take that risk Maman.

344
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,070
Sorry.

345
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:28,349
Let's go.

346
00:58:30,225 --> 00:58:31,084
Stay!

347
00:58:31,298 --> 00:58:32,472
Jamal!

348
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:33,785
Jamal!

349
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:39,940
Let's go! Let's go!

350
00:58:48,223 --> 00:58:52,396
Who invented the revolver?

351
00:58:58,256 --> 00:58:59,987
Samuel Colt.

352
00:59:01,222 --> 00:59:03,123
Final answer?

353
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:06,186
Final answer.

354
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:08,336
Jamal Malik,

355
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,423
you're on a dream run.

356
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,822
My heart says you're gonna win more.

357
00:59:16,257 --> 00:59:17,457
Computer-ji,

358
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,770
A lock.

359
00:59:27,256 --> 00:59:28,486
I was right.

360
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:31,620
The chaiwalla has done it again.

361
00:59:34,723 --> 00:59:36,057
Incredible!

362
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,039
Reception!

363
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:01,740
Let's go.

364
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,130
Found something?

365
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,017
Stay there. Look away.

366
01:00:21,253 --> 01:00:22,783
Ok, ok.

367
01:00:23,218 --> 01:00:26,219
I'll know if you're looking.

368
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,482
No I'm not.

369
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:30,105
Is Salim still there?

370
01:00:38,253 --> 01:00:39,375
Where is Salim?

371
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:43,981
I don't know.

372
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,522
You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

373
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:43,662
I'm looking for Javed.

374
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:47,676
Motherfucker!
He's not looking for you.

375
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:52,980
I killed Maman,

376
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,913
and I'll kill you too.

377
01:02:00,248 --> 01:02:02,058
Easy.

378
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,271
Did you really kill him?

379
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:11,292
Good.

380
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:14,435
My enemy's enemy is a friend.

381
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:19,109
Come here, my friend.

382
01:02:25,414 --> 01:02:27,614
I've been looking for someone like you.

383
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:37,311
You came back for me.

384
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:40,578
Of course.

385
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:46,675
I thought you'd forgotten.

386
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:49,226
I never forgot.

387
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,526
Not for one moment.

388
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:54,511
I knew I'd find you in the end.

389
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:57,710
It's our destiny.

390
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:00,968
Destiny?

391
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:04,049
Ok.

392
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:21,748
Hey.

393
01:03:27,243 --> 01:03:28,474
Come.

394
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,211
No, brother. You had a lot to drink.

395
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:34,027
I am the elder.

396
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:36,222
I am the boss.

397
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:39,210
For once, you do as I say.

398
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:40,873
Now get out!

399
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:44,209
Come on, I saved your life, didn't I?

400
01:03:44,244 --> 01:03:45,473
Salim, please...

401
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:46,474
Shut up.

402
01:03:47,472 --> 01:03:48,905
I'll kill you!

403
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:49,907
Salim!

404
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:58,008
I'll kill you!

405
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,907
I am number one now.

406
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:10,808
Salim!

407
01:04:10,942 --> 01:04:12,018
Salim! Open!

408
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:15,871
Shut up!

409
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:18,772
The man with the Colt 45 says shut up!

410
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:23,107
Go now or gun master-ji and I will
shoot you right between the eyes.

411
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:26,172
Don't think you won't.

412
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:29,406
I'm giving you five seconds.

413
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,241
One.

414
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:33,959
Two.

415
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,628
Go, Jamal.

416
01:04:40,529 --> 01:04:41,529
Go.

417
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,735
Let's go.

418
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:10,304
So, did you see them again?

419
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:12,405
I wouldn't be here if I had.

420
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,121
Was she pretty?

421
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:20,780
I guess not.

422
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:25,548
The most beautiful woman in the world.

423
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:27,161
You mean the bitch of the slum.

424
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:28,662
Sisterfucker.

425
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,060
Hey hero.

426
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:33,763
Hey beat him!

427
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:37,763
Hey lock him down!

428
01:05:37,864 --> 01:05:40,364
Lock him... he fights! Motherfucker!

429
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:41,991
Well well...

430
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:44,281
The slumdog barks.

431
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,367
Money and women.

432
01:05:46,803 --> 01:05:49,705
The reasons for make most mistakes in life.
Correct.

433
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:52,797
Looks like you've mixed up both.

434
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:56,597
Srinivas,

435
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:59,277
you need the exercise.

436
01:06:00,013 --> 01:06:02,037
Go and get me something to eat.

437
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:03,902
Yes sir.

438
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:06,244
And tea.

439
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:20,157
Idiot, Srinivas.

440
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:28,166
You puzzled me slumdog.

441
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,099
Admitting murder to avoid child fraud.

442
01:06:32,234 --> 01:06:34,802
Is not exactly clever thinking.

443
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:38,765
Now why would you do that?

444
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,113
When somebody asks me a question,

445
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,112
I tell them the answer.

446
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:56,800
So, how did you manage to get on the show?

447
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:02,016
Okay everyone, listen up.

448
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,800
It's been a big week for UK.

449
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:07,463
Kat is back.

450
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:09,269
But she is already back.

451
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:10,500
Bardi...

452
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,329
Jamal?

453
01:07:12,817 --> 01:07:14,839
Oh, well, she did come back,

454
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,311
then she went away when
Alfie split up with her,

455
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,004
and now she's back again,

456
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:21,197
but it looks as if Alfie
still fancies more...

457
01:07:21,232 --> 01:07:22,863
Thank you, Jamal.

458
01:07:23,598 --> 01:07:26,028
Bardi, keep up. The chaiwalla
knows more than you.

459
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:31,056
Anyway, there's also the
festival in Edinburgh.

460
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:32,749
Anybody knows Edinburgh, Edinburgh?

461
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,361
Kilts, castles,

462
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:37,177
Haggis.

463
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:39,011
Ben Navis.

464
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,164
Good, yes?

465
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:44,097
Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.

466
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:47,100
Good, and "lochs". Their word for lakes.

467
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:48,930
No filming.

468
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:56,565
Jamal?

469
01:07:56,979 --> 01:07:58,162
Come here.

470
01:07:58,796 --> 01:08:00,197
I'm on "Millionaire" duty today.

471
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:01,756
Dev!

472
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:04,084
Please, just for five minutes.
I can't.

473
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:06,500
Sit here.

474
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:09,365
If the team leader comes just pretend
you're on a call doing an upgrade for.

475
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:10,793
"Friends and Family", I know. Yeah.

476
01:08:11,894 --> 01:08:13,145
Two minutes.

477
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:20,206
<i>"Who wants to be a millionaire?"</i>

478
01:08:20,907 --> 01:08:22,962
<i>Dial this number now!</i>

479
01:08:27,544 --> 01:08:29,294
Hello. Hello!

480
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,345
I would like to be a contestant of
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

481
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:38,159
Bloody bastard. I never get it.

482
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:41,195
You have to dial, when Prem says "if".

483
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:42,709
That's when they open the lines.

484
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:44,159
How the hell do you know that?

485
01:08:44,693 --> 01:08:47,695
That's what Anjum in Technical
says. He put a system in.

486
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,963
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

487
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:53,024
<i>Forgetting someone there for god's sake?</i>

488
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:57,419
<i>Hello?
Dear god will somebody talk to me?</i>

489
01:08:58,254 --> 01:08:59,305
Hello.

490
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:02,499
Mrs. MacKintosh from...

491
01:09:02,913 --> 01:09:04,591
Kin.. gussie.

492
01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:08,094
<i>It's Kingussie, love.
Pronounced: "Kee-nu-ssi".</i>

493
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:11,057
<i>So where are you from?
Abroad I bet?</i>

494
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:14,393
Just down the road from
your house, Mrs. MacKintosh.

495
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:16,561
Next to the "loch".

496
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:19,291
<i>Ok, which "loch"?</i>

497
01:09:19,892 --> 01:09:26,226
"Loch" Big... "loch" Ben... "Loch" Big Ben.

498
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:28,698
Next door to Sean Connery's flat.

499
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:31,097
<i>Look. I'd like to your supervisor, son?</i>

500
01:10:19,224 --> 01:10:20,506
<i>Yes?</i>

501
01:10:20,741 --> 01:10:22,155
Salim?

502
01:10:22,189 --> 01:10:24,588
<i>Who is this?
Do you know what time is this?</i>

503
01:10:34,224 --> 01:10:35,225
<i>Hello?</i>

504
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:49,225
<i>Hello?</i>

505
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:51,226
<i>Hello?</i>

506
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,353
<i>Who is this?</i>

507
01:10:56,188 --> 01:10:58,754
I'm calling from XL5 Communications sir.

508
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:05,188
As a valued customer, we are offering you
a free upgrade with our "Friends and...

509
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:06,551
family".

510
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:08,551
<i>Jamal?</i>

511
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,801
<i>Is that you, brother?</i>

512
01:11:12,423 --> 01:11:15,787
<i>Where are you?
I thought you were dead or something.</i>

513
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,353
<i>Listen, we had to go Jamal.</i>

514
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:22,086
<i>Maman's guys...
they were searching the hotel.</i>

515
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,962
<i>Jamal?</i>

516
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:26,288
<i>Say something, please!</i>

517
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:29,151
Hello, Salim!

518
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:33,187
Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.

519
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:35,149
Can I ask why?

520
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:39,186
Too obvious. There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London.

521
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:43,355
There's a rowing race between Oxford
and Cambridge, so there's probably

522
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:45,999
a Cambridge Circus too, no?

523
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,340
I'll go for D.

524
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:48,265
London.

525
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:50,087
Computer-ji,

526
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:52,900
D lock.

527
01:12:00,407 --> 01:12:01,807
Jamal Malik,

528
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:04,220
you are absolutely right.

529
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,283
<i>It's getting hot in here.</i>

530
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:18,884
Are you nervous?

531
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:20,049
What?

532
01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:22,947
Am I nervous?

533
01:12:23,183 --> 01:12:25,484
It's you who's in the hot seat, my friend.

534
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,249
<i>Oh yes, sorry.</i>

535
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:31,383
Balli, he's got prey on the run.

536
01:12:32,017 --> 01:12:33,048
Finally.

537
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:34,749
<i>A few hours ago...</i>

538
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,482
you were giving chai
for the phone wallas.

539
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:41,684
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

540
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:43,847
What a player!

541
01:12:45,182 --> 01:12:48,382
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

542
01:13:30,216 --> 01:13:31,645
Jamal?

543
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,080
God is good, Brother.
God is good.

544
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,853
Maman's guys were out for us.

545
01:13:54,867 --> 01:13:56,193
We just had to escape.

546
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:56,900
Liar.

547
01:13:57,114 --> 01:13:58,858
I left a message for you at work.

548
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:00,013
We waited for weeks for you at Nagpur.

549
01:14:00,014 --> 01:14:01,951
There was no message.
Brother.

550
01:14:02,265 --> 01:14:03,787
I definitely left a message.

551
01:14:03,788 --> 01:14:07,103
There was no message! There was no message!
There was no message!

552
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:14,226
I will never forgive you.

553
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:21,402
I know.

554
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,281
That used to be our slum.

555
01:14:30,795 --> 01:14:32,292
Can you believe that, huh?

556
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:35,778
We used to live right there man.

557
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:41,141
Now is all business.

558
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:44,478
India is at the centre of
the world now. Brother.

559
01:14:45,213 --> 01:14:46,743
And I...

560
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:50,878
I am at the centre of the centre.

561
01:14:53,313 --> 01:14:55,941
This is all Javed's houses.

562
01:14:58,177 --> 01:14:59,305
Javed Khan?

563
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,189
The gangster from our slum?

564
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,440
You work for him?

565
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:04,477
Come on.

566
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,979
Who else would save us from Maman's guys?

567
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:09,253
What do you do for him?

568
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,106
Anything he asks.

569
01:15:20,677 --> 01:15:21,909
He's coming.

570
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:23,687
You need to go now.

571
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:25,876
Take my card.

572
01:15:26,211 --> 01:15:27,241
What for?

573
01:15:27,476 --> 01:15:29,775
You think them gonna let you
out of my sight again?

574
01:15:30,209 --> 01:15:32,175
You stay with me my younger brother.

575
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,339
Now go. My place.

576
01:15:35,352 --> 01:15:36,352
Salim!

577
01:15:37,174 --> 01:15:38,575
Where is Latika?

578
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,257
Still?

579
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:44,808
She's gone brother.

580
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:46,775
Long gone.

581
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,568
Now go.

582
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:51,071
Go to my place.

583
01:16:15,174 --> 01:16:16,722
Ok, Sir. I'll be right there.

584
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:52,255
Go.

585
01:17:36,849 --> 01:17:39,701
Brother-ji, I am your new
cook from the agency.

586
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:42,068
Thousands apologies,
I'm so late for the Mensa.

587
01:17:43,004 --> 01:17:44,674
Just a minute.

588
01:18:00,866 --> 01:18:02,066
<i>Excuse me.</i>

589
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:04,533
<i>There's nothing about any cook.</i>

590
01:18:05,668 --> 01:18:07,473
<i>There's a dishwasher being delivered.</i>

591
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:09,567
<i>Do you know anything about that?</i>

592
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:13,558
Oh brother, I... I'm your dishwasher.

593
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:17,222
Jamal!

594
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:23,721
Look at you.

595
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:32,245
I've found you!

596
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:37,346
I've found you.

597
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:47,020
Your face.

598
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,364
You've hurt your eye.

599
01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:50,930
Why are you here?

600
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:54,924
To see you.

601
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,647
Why?

602
01:19:57,161 --> 01:19:58,578
You see me,

603
01:19:59,592 --> 01:20:00,689
now what?

604
01:20:10,963 --> 01:20:12,961
Why does everyone love this program?

605
01:20:14,197 --> 01:20:15,789
This is a chance to escape,

606
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,173
isn't it?

607
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,561
Walk into another life.

608
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:23,226
Oh, god.

609
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,761
Javed will kill you. Here.

610
01:20:30,897 --> 01:20:31,925
Javed?

611
01:20:32,759 --> 01:20:33,945
You are with him?

612
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:45,725
First, you want a dishwasher,

613
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,260
now you want this fucking cook?

614
01:20:49,552 --> 01:20:50,594
He's just...

615
01:20:50,607 --> 01:20:51,607
Shut up!

616
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:53,525
The cricket is on.

617
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:56,986
And why you watch this shit TV?

618
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,725
At least I am a millionaire.

619
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,727
Come on, I am hungry.
Make me a sandwich.

620
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,556
Come away with me.

621
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,523
Away? Where?

622
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:45,663
And live out what?

623
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:51,220
Love.

624
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:56,757
Come away with me. Now.

625
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:14,805
Salim will help us.

626
01:22:15,954 --> 01:22:16,954
Salim?

627
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,828
You still believe in Salim?

628
01:22:23,996 --> 01:22:26,812
Jamal,
I'll be gone soon anyway.

629
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,262
We're getting out of Bombay.

630
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:32,620
Where?

631
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:34,930
You think he'd tell me?

632
01:22:36,178 --> 01:22:38,101
No! No! No!

633
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:42,500
Fuck.

634
01:22:58,153 --> 01:22:59,737
What is this shit?

635
01:23:01,438 --> 01:23:02,444
Get out!

636
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:03,989
Get out!

637
01:23:07,078 --> 01:23:08,375
Motherfucker.

638
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,019
Go, before he kills us both.

639
01:23:16,454 --> 01:23:18,052
You want to do something for me?

640
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:19,086
Anything.

641
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:20,353
Then forget me.

642
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,415
What? No.

643
01:23:23,151 --> 01:23:28,851
I will wait. The VT station.
5 O'clock, every day until you come.

644
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:34,817
I love you.

645
01:23:36,353 --> 01:23:37,503
So what?

646
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:40,966
It's too late, Jamal. Now go.

647
01:23:51,684 --> 01:23:52,749
So Jamal.

648
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:56,852
Which cricketer has scored the most
first class centuries in history?

649
01:24:09,151 --> 01:24:12,650
But remember, if you answer wrong...

650
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:14,942
you lose everything...

651
01:24:15,856 --> 01:24:17,162
just like this.

652
01:24:19,183 --> 01:24:21,283
So do you want to do this?

653
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:48,448
Dreams of so many...

654
01:24:50,949 --> 01:24:52,420
on the floor.

655
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:12,720
Latika.

656
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:17,820
Latika.

657
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,822
Latika.

658
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,521
Latika! Latika!!

659
01:26:46,522 --> 01:26:49,520
Jamal! Jamal!... Jamal!

660
01:27:20,424 --> 01:27:22,125
No Jamal!

661
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:25,024
Latika!

662
01:27:28,626 --> 01:27:29,827
Latika!

663
01:27:30,427 --> 01:27:31,626
Latika!

664
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,939
Time for commercial break
ladies and gentlemen.

665
01:27:40,474 --> 01:27:43,640
I know, I know. I can't
stand the tension either.

666
01:27:43,876 --> 01:27:45,374
We'll be right back.

667
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:56,966
Guy from the slums,

668
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,051
becomes a millionaire overnight.

669
01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:03,737
You know who's the only other
person who's done that?

670
01:28:05,172 --> 01:28:06,203
Me.

671
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:11,105
I know what it feels like.

672
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:13,403
I know what you're being through.

673
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:16,039
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

674
01:28:17,174 --> 01:28:19,354
I don't know the answer.

675
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:22,264
You said that before, yeah...

676
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:25,638
No really, this time I don't.

677
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:28,638
Come on, you can't take
the money and run now.

678
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,053
You are on the edge of history kid.

679
01:28:34,788 --> 01:28:36,664
I don't see what else I can do.

680
01:28:37,699 --> 01:28:39,401
Maybe it's written my friend.

681
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:44,283
I don't know I just have
some kind of gut feeling,

682
01:28:44,597 --> 01:28:46,151
you're gonna win this.

683
01:28:46,173 --> 01:28:47,772
Trust me, Jamal.

684
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,289
You're gonna win.

685
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:26,013
<i>Standby, everyone. We are on line in 13...</i>

686
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:28,890
<i>Rakesh please give backup, man.</i>

687
01:29:30,022 --> 01:29:31,650
Yeah, he's gone. I'm just giving...

688
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:35,282
Come fast.

689
01:29:36,133 --> 01:29:37,504
20 seconds!

690
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:45,868
Do the right thing and in
approximately 3 minutes,

691
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:47,427
you'll be as famous as me.

692
01:29:48,528 --> 01:29:49,798
<i>10 seconds!</i>

693
01:29:50,133 --> 01:29:52,194
And as rich as me.

694
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:55,445
Almost.

695
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:57,033
<i>5 seconds!</i>

696
01:29:57,247 --> 01:29:58,699
<i>4... 3...</i>

697
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:00,940
From rags to Raja.

698
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:02,664
It's your destiny.

699
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:05,570
<i>We are on.
Applause and music please!</i>

700
01:30:14,971 --> 01:30:16,669
Jugulu out, cut!

701
01:30:18,598 --> 01:30:21,799
Welcome back to
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"

702
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,422
In the chair tonight is Jamal Malik,

703
01:30:25,236 --> 01:30:26,533
as if we don't know.

704
01:30:28,568 --> 01:30:30,348
<i>For 10 million rupees.</i>

705
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:33,598
To question once again.

706
01:30:43,168 --> 01:30:45,330
No it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.

707
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:46,796
That's a start.

708
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:52,031
So it could be Ricky Ponting,
Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

709
01:30:54,165 --> 01:30:55,961
I'll use a lifeline.

710
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,742
Fifty-fifty.

711
01:30:57,764 --> 01:30:58,795
Ok.

712
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,729
Computer, take away the
two wrong answers please.

713
01:31:05,164 --> 01:31:07,948
Well, you were right
about Sachin Tendulkar.

714
01:31:08,382 --> 01:31:10,828
That leaves your fifty-fifty choice, Jamal.

715
01:31:11,163 --> 01:31:13,130
B: Ricky Ponting or D: Jack Hobbs.

716
01:31:15,165 --> 01:31:16,694
What do you think?

717
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:21,328
Decision time.

718
01:31:21,941 --> 01:31:24,141
For 10 million rupees.

719
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:28,164
B: Ricky Ponting.

720
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:31,679
Or D: Jack Hobbs.

721
01:31:45,164 --> 01:31:46,246
D.

722
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,192
Not B?

723
01:31:56,128 --> 01:32:00,527
The Ricky Ponting,
the Australian great cricketer?

724
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,626
D, Jack Hobbs.

725
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,292
You know?

726
01:32:11,128 --> 01:32:13,126
So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

727
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,145
Or D, Jack Hobbs.

728
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,491
The final answer, D.

729
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:24,925
Computer-ji D...

730
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:27,238
D Lock.

731
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,559
D lock. Computer-ji D lock.

732
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:47,325
With 197 first class centuries,
the answer is...

733
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,390
D, Jack Hobbs!

734
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:57,411
Jamal Malik!

735
01:32:58,825 --> 01:33:00,225
Millionaire!

736
01:33:08,898 --> 01:33:11,398
Do the dance! Come on! Come on!

737
01:33:14,371 --> 01:33:15,628
Well done!

738
01:33:16,242 --> 01:33:17,334
Well done.

739
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:44,822
So, are you ready for the final question?

740
01:33:45,157 --> 01:33:48,887
For 20 million rupees.

741
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:53,172
No.

742
01:33:54,186 --> 01:33:57,335
But maybe it's written, no?

743
01:33:59,156 --> 01:34:00,387
Maybe.

744
01:34:02,123 --> 01:34:04,673
Okay. The final question!

745
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:06,236
Who wants to be a...

746
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:14,522
What a show ladies and gentlemen!
What a show!

747
01:34:15,157 --> 01:34:16,187
Join us tomorrow night,

748
01:34:16,423 --> 01:34:18,116
to see if Jamal Malik has made,

749
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,135
the biggest mistake of his life...

750
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:25,837
This way.

751
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:34,685
Great show.

752
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:40,020
See you tomorrow ok.

753
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:41,456
Be on time.
Yeah.

754
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:43,156
Bye.

755
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:48,957
Let's go!
Easy!

756
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,270
Easy!

757
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,471
No tricks!
What's going on?

758
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:03,082
He's a cheat.
How do you know he's cheating?

759
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,369
Bloody village boy.

760
01:35:07,783 --> 01:35:10,634
I fed him the wrong answer,
and he never should call it right.

761
01:35:11,755 --> 01:35:13,183
You gave him an answer?

762
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:15,218
Not exactly.

763
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:17,247
Well that doesn't matter.

764
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,030
That's my show!

765
01:35:20,152 --> 01:35:21,753
My fucking show!

766
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:35,748
It is a bizarrely plausible,

767
01:35:37,062 --> 01:35:38,073
and yet...

768
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:39,184
Because,

769
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:40,492
I'm a slumdog,

770
01:35:40,906 --> 01:35:42,217
a chaiwalla.

771
01:35:42,352 --> 01:35:43,734
I'm a liar right?

772
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:45,083
Most of you are.

773
01:35:45,718 --> 01:35:48,717
But you are not a liar, Mr Malik.
That's for sure.

774
01:35:50,152 --> 01:35:51,516
You are too truthful.

775
01:35:55,151 --> 01:35:56,479
We're done.

776
01:36:00,614 --> 01:36:02,416
I don't know where they've taken her.

777
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,551
Latika.

778
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:22,314
I went on the show, because I
thought she'd be watching.

779
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:42,112
<i>Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated 18 year
old boy from the slums of Mumbay,</i>

780
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:46,079
<i>win one crore by fair
means or by foul play.</i>

781
01:36:46,114 --> 01:36:49,078
<i>And the crowd around me bears
an even bigger question:</i>

782
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:53,213
<i>Will he be back tonight to play
for another 20 million rupees?</i>

783
01:36:55,216 --> 01:36:58,708
<i>Jamal Malik, a name which has
been in news in every town,</i>

790
01:37:29,145 --> 01:37:30,911
Hey you come here, give me a kiss.

791

Come on girls!

792
01:37:39,678 --> 01:37:41,478
Hey, move back.

793
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:59,509
<i>As if it wasn't enough drama in a
contestant reaching the final question,</i>

794
01:37:59,545 --> 01:38:04,308
<i>Jamal Malik was last night
arrested on suspicion of fraud.</i>

795
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:05,769
That guy.

796
01:38:06,483 --> 01:38:07,764
He will never come.

797
01:38:09,578 --> 01:38:10,671
Ever.

798
01:38:13,144 --> 01:38:14,845
Crazy fucker.

799
01:38:22,445 --> 01:38:23,245
Go.

800
01:38:24,928 --> 01:38:25,728
Go.

801
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,074
But...

802
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:28,095
Just drive.

803
01:38:29,309 --> 01:38:31,108
There won't be another chance.

804
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,172
He will kill you.

805
01:38:38,173 --> 01:38:39,173
Yes ok.

806
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:44,807
I'll take care of him.

807
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:52,042
Salim, I can't.

808
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,258
You have to.

809
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,117
God sake will take you out of this.

810

please forgive me.

812
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,840

Welcome back to
"Who wants to be a millionaire."

I can safely say that tonight,

Lucky.

841
01:43:48,127 --> 01:43:50,058
<i>A: Aramis.</i>

842
01:43:50,093 --> 01:43:54,095
<i>B: Cardinal Richelieu.</i>

843
01:43:54,129 --> 01:43:57,009
C: D'Artagnan.

844
01:43:57,145 --> 01:43:59,559
Or D: Planchet.

845
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:00,660
Porthos!

846
01:44:07,094 --> 01:44:10,292
Final question for 20 million
rupees and he is smiling.

847
01:44:10,427 --> 01:44:12,410
I guess you know the answer.

848
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:15,892
Do you believe it, I don't.

849
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,657
You don't?

850
01:44:20,093 --> 01:44:23,292
<i>So you take the 10 million and walk?</i>

851
01:44:25,127 --> 01:44:26,209
No.

852
01:44:27,123 --> 01:44:28,269
<i>I'll play.</i>

853
01:44:31,091 --> 01:44:33,056
Let remind you, Jamal.

854
01:44:33,092 --> 01:44:35,590
If you get the answer wrong,

855
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,056
<i>you lose everything.</i>

856
01:44:39,091 --> 01:44:41,990
<i>10 million rupees, Jamal.</i>

857
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,456
<i>It's a fortune.</i>

858
01:44:47,092 --> 01:44:49,490
I'd like to phone a friend.

859
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:52,856
You're going to the wire.

860
01:44:54,091 --> 01:44:56,042
The final lifeline.

861
01:44:56,556 --> 01:44:57,903
Here we go.

862
01:45:05,124 --> 01:45:06,408
<i>It's ringing!</i>

863
01:45:12,443 --> 01:45:13,654
Who is it?

864
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:16,553
That's my brother's number, but...

865
01:45:20,089 --> 01:45:24,589
The kind of brother, who go for a
walk on a 20 million rupee question?

866
01:45:26,123 --> 01:45:27,924
It's the only number I know.

867
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
You are on your own, Jamal.

868
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,151
<i>Hello?</i>

869
01:46:07,387 --> 01:46:08,852
Hello, Jamal?

870
01:46:10,088 --> 01:46:12,887
I'm guessing that isn't your brother.

871
01:46:15,121 --> 01:46:16,452
This is...

872
01:46:17,088 --> 01:46:18,722
<i>My name is Latika.</i>

873
01:46:18,923 --> 01:46:20,150
Okay, Latika.

874
01:46:20,885 --> 01:46:22,747
You want to hear the
question one more time?

875
01:46:23,861 --> 01:46:25,288
And let's be clear about this.

876
01:46:25,422 --> 01:46:27,854
<i>20 million rupees right on your answer,</i>

877
01:46:27,855 --> 01:46:29,286
<i>you have 30 seconds.</i>

878
01:46:29,287 --> 01:46:30,287
Latika!

879
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,420
<i>Jamal.</i>

880
01:46:31,421 --> 01:46:34,885
Salim!
<i>Please read out the question to Latika now.</i>

881
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:40,049
It is really you?

882
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:41,683
Yes.

883
01:46:42,084 --> 01:46:43,651
The question, Jamal. The question!

884
01:46:45,086 --> 01:46:47,584
In Alexandre Dumas' book,
the "The Three Musketeers",

885
01:46:47,619 --> 01:46:50,084
two of the musketeers are
called Athos and Porthos.

886
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,051
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

887
01:46:52,585 --> 01:46:53,774
Was it A:

888
01:46:53,888 --> 01:46:55,262
Aramis, B:

889
01:46:55,275 --> 01:46:57,275
<i>Cardinal Richelieu, C: D'Artagnan,</i>

890
01:46:57,288 --> 01:46:58,820
<i>D: Planchet?</i>

891
01:46:59,721 --> 01:47:01,121
15 seconds!

892
01:47:01,636 --> 01:47:03,009
Where are you?

893
01:47:03,145 --> 01:47:04,615
I am safe.

894
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:06,648
10 seconds!

895
01:47:07,382 --> 01:47:08,950
Latika, what do you think?

896
01:47:13,084 --> 01:47:14,500
I don't know.

897
01:47:16,914 --> 01:47:18,297
<i>I've never known.</i>

898
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,516
<i>Jamal, God will...</i>

899
01:47:30,582 --> 01:47:34,083
You really are on your own now, Jamal.

900
01:47:35,316 --> 01:47:39,118
Your final answer for 20 million rupees.

901
01:47:51,317 --> 01:47:52,317
A.

902
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,846
A, because?

903
01:47:58,481 --> 01:47:59,499
Just...

904
01:48:00,413 --> 01:48:01,493
because.

905
01:48:02,005 --> 01:48:03,046
Hey, Salim!

906
01:48:05,148 --> 01:48:06,949
You inside, you shameless Salim...

907
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,347
Final answer?

908
01:48:09,248 --> 01:48:09,948
Latika!

909
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:13,202
Yes, final answer. A,

910
01:48:14,216 --> 01:48:15,395
Aramis.

911
01:48:17,015 --> 01:48:18,716
Computer-ji, lock A.

912
01:48:27,316 --> 01:48:28,417
Jamal Malik,

913
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:29,880
Salim! Salim!
Open the door! Salim!

914
01:48:29,981 --> 01:48:31,679
Call centre assistant from Mumbay,

915
01:48:32,815 --> 01:48:33,946
chaiwalla,

916
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:37,744
for two draws 20 million rupees.

917
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:41,898
You were asked who
the third musketeer was,

918
01:48:41,911 --> 01:48:44,391
in novel by Alexander Dumas.

919
01:48:44,404 --> 01:48:45,946
You answered,

920
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,082
A,

921
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:49,569
Aramis.

922
01:48:51,078 --> 01:48:53,979
Which is. I have to tell you.

923
01:48:55,715 --> 01:48:57,414
The right answer!

924
01:49:23,113 --> 01:49:24,494
Jamal Malik!

925
01:49:26,095 --> 01:49:27,695
Double millionaire!

926
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:32,129
God is great.

927
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:40,037
What a night!

928
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:14,136
I knew you'd be watching.

929
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:17,370
I thought we'd be together only in death.

930
01:53:03,602 --> 01:53:05,267
This is our destiny.

931
01:53:08,601 --> 01:53:10,001
Kiss me.

932
01:53:26,025 --> 01:53:28,625
