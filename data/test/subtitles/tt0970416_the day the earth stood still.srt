1
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,264
Thiobacillus, which.

2
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,914
William, is a
remarkable bacterium...

3
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,623
because...

4
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,103
It's the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid.

5
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,258
That's right, and...

6
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:26,420
- Yes, Miss Rouhani?
- Deinococcus radiodurans.

7
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:28,462
First discovered in
1956, breeding...

8
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,343
inside drums of
radioactive waste.

9
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:33,260
That's correct. So, pompejana,
Thiobacillus, Deinococcus.

10
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,748
Which of these three
would most likely survive...

11
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:37,975
in the extreme
environment of the

12
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,035
Jupiter moon
Callisto, and why?

13
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,583
Tom, can you get
the lights, please?

14
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:42,602
That's your lab
report question...

15
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,023
for this week,

16
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,747
and it's due in my box
by midnight on Friday.

17
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,262
That's all for
today. Thank you.

18
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,264
So, are you coming...

19
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,023
to the faculty
conference tonight?

20
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,423
To listen to Dean
Stoff lecture...

21
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,828
about how the universe
is like a beautiful woman?

22
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:02,066
- Think I'll pass.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

23
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,017
- Uh-uh.
- I could pick you up.

24
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,183
Um...

25
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:12,818
Can't. I have to get back
to my own extreme environment.

26
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:13,983
But thank you.

27
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,988
- See you tomorrow.
- Yep.

28
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,343
Come on. Go.

29
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:29,623
Jacob?
- Go, go.

30
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:34,098
Come on, come on.

31
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:36,188
- Yes.
- Jacob, dinner.

32
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,503
- You finished your homework?
- Yes. You just killed me.

33
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,743
Good. Now that you're dead,
you can shut that off...

34
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,383
and come down for dinner.

35
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,743
Did you order
pepperoni tonight?

36
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,818
- No. Are these clean?
- Yeah.

37
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,303
We've had pizza
twice this week,

38
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,739
so I made you a
proper meal tonight,

39
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:57,903
with vegetables.

40
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,908
Vegetables? Ew.

41
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:02,018
Stop being such a stepmom.

42
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:05,948
Where'd you get this?

43
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:09,508
It was Dad's.

44
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,743
Yeah, I know. Where was it?

45
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,736
I found it in the
downstairs bathroom.

46
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,741
It's mine now.

47
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,308
Okay.

48
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,181
Okay. Come on,
I said please shut that off.

49
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,063
- You didn't say 'please.'
- Jacob.

50
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,068
Helen.

51
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,103
- Hello?
- Helen Benson?

52
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,383
- Yes.
- Dr. Helen Benson?

53
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:40,699
- You're at 106 Longwood Road?
- Who is this?

54
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:42,623
Someone should be
there shortly.

55
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,630
What do you mean,

56
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,700
someone's coming
here? Who is this?

57
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,860
Everything will be
explained to you en route.

58
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,468
En route where?

59
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,942
- Hello?
- They should be there soon.

60
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,028
Yes, they're at your door now.

61
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,308
Hold on a minute.

62
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:08,582
Dr. Benson, if you'll
come with us...

63
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,329
- What's happening?

64
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:10,343
Everything will be explained,

65
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,816
but you must come
with us right away.

66
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:15,900
- Am I under arrest?
- You're in Federal custody.

67
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:17,743
Why?

68
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,755
- What is this about?

69
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,583
Everything will be
explained en route.

70
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:21,663
I have a child here.

71
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,943
Is there anyone
who can look after the boy?

72
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:24,236
- No.

73
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,583
Can his father
take care of him?

74
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,983
No, his father isn't here.

75
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,120
- I can take care of myself.

76
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,703
Jacob, you can't take
care of yourself.

77
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,564
- There's just no way...

78
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:31,783
You're coming with
us, Dr. Benson.

79
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,788
Helen?

80
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:41,866
Jacob, grab your coat.
You're gonna stay at Isabel's.

81
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:46,587
Attention, Bravo,
prepare to move out.

82
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,343
It's going to be okay.

83
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,862
Dr. Benson, there
isn't much time.

84
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,017
Okay, we've got her. Let's go.

85
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:17,186
Two stoplights
down, then left,

86
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,462
there's an on-ramp
to the highway.

87
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,382
- Do you see it?
- This must be a mistake.

88
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,300
Helen Benson,

89
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,697
Social Security
number 51-48-7843?

90
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:24,902
- Yeah.
- There's no mistake.

91
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:25,944
- What is this about?

92
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,382
Everything will be explained.

93
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,462
Stop the car.

94
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,935
- Can you stop
the car, please?

95
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,222
Ma'am.

96
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,182
I'm not under arrest.
You can't do this.

97
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:33,974
- This is a matter of
national security.

98
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:34,782
National security?

99
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,422
Well, that just means
whatever you want it to mean.

100
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,965
I'm just asking you to tell me...

101
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,462
why I'm needed,
or to let me go.

102
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,519
Ma'am, I can't tell you...

103
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,102
why you're needed
because I don't know.

104
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,582
But I know they need you,
and I know it's urgent.

105
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,587
How do you know that?

106
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,182
Where are all the cars?

107
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:55,179
- They shut down the highway.
- They shut it down?

108
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,267
- For what?
- For us.

109
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,467
- Hi. I'm Yusef.
- Helen.

110
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,777
Helen, do you have any idea
why this is happening to us?

111
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,502
- No.
- Well, think.

112
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:51,062
What do we have in common?

113
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,396
- What do you do
for a living, Yusef?

114
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,262
I'm a nuclear physicist.

115
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,782
- I'm an astronomer.
- A geologist.

116
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,087
- I'm an astrobiologist.
- Fossil record study?

117
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,661
No, microbiology.
Theories of life beyond Earth.

118
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,687
- All right, so
we're all scientists.

119
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,502
No, not me. I'm
a civil engineer.

120
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,982
Put it all together.
What do you get?

121
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:06,488
I've participated
in government...

122
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:07,862
mobilizations
like this before.

123
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,542
War games and preparations
for certain scenarios...

124
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,411
- Is that what
you think this is?

125
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:11,662
No.

126
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,022
Whatever it is,
it's not a game.

127
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:50,742
Your attention, please.

128
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:52,325
Make your way directly across...

129
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,142
the courtyard to
the main barracks.

130
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,866
Leave all your cell phones
and cameras here.

131
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:58,485
I repeat, cell phones...

132
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,735
and cameras are
not allowed inside.

133
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,827
Leave any cell phones
and cameras here.

134
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,867
Helen.

135
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,862
Can we bring her up?

136
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,342
you need to give up
your cell phones...

137
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:09,742
Your attention, please...
- Thank you.

138
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,239
...make your way
directly across...

139
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:12,822
the courtyard to
the main barracks...

140
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,022
- Helen.
- Hi, Michael.

141
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,582
- Been a long time.
- Are you behind all this?

142
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,422
Yes. I'm glad you came.

143
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,151
- It's not like
I had a choice.

144
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,182
Sorry about that.

145
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,782
I had you put on
the 'vital' list.

146
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,462
I thought it was important
to have you part of this team.

147
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,582
Why?

148
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:26,166
I've been keeping up
with the work you've...

149
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,462
been doing with
Professor Barnhardt.

150
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,182
What does it have
to do with this?

151
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,737
I'll have to crash-brief you
in the conference room.

152
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,231
Object 07/493 was
first spotted...

153
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,745
just beyond Jupiter's orbit...

154
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,782
by the Spaceguard program.

155
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,002
It was notable for the
fact that it was...

156
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,982
not moving in an
asteroidal ellipse,

157
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:49,262
but rather, it had a
hyperbolic orbit...

158
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:52,783
and was shooting
through our solar system.

159
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,017
The object was
moving at speeds...

160
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,516
of up to three times
10-to-the-seventh...

161
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:58,662
meters per second.

162
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,827
At first, it was
projected to pass...

163
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,343
millions of miles
outside of Earth's orbit.

164
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,702
However, we soon discovered
that the object...

165
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,079
was not following...

166
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,541
a gravitationally
freefall trajectory.

167
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:13,984
As such, its path
was recalculated.

168
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:19,836
It was at this time...

169
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,057
a crisis response
team was activated...

170
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,845
and everything you
see around you...

171
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,850
was set in motion.

172
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,827
Can we launch a missile
to intercept it?

173
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,836
The military is attempting
to do just that.

174
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,382
In fact, they may
launch several.

175
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,523
But, given the speed...

176
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,142
at which this
object is moving,

177
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:40,537
our chances of success
are slim, at best.

178
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:42,422
Why don't they
evacuate the area?

179
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,102
We simply do not
have enough time.

180
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:47,702
The affected area contains
some 8 million inhabitants.

181
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:51,223
The best we can do
is to plan for the aftermath.

182
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,307
How long do we have?

183
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:58,987
Seventy-eight minutes.

184
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:02,381
Hey.

185
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:05,144
What did the cops
want, anyway?

186
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:12,583
Well, there's going to be
a big storm tonight,

187
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,751
and they needed
some scientists...

188
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,756
to help out, you know,

189
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:20,536
with planning stuff. So...

190
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,704
Pretty soon you're all gonna
go down to the basement, okay?

191
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,062
I already told Isabel.

192
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,742
I haven't seen
anything on TVabout...

193
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:30,747
Jacob, just...

194
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,747
Just do it. All right?

195
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,022
All right. I should go.

196
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:40,179
Wait... Can we talk just
a little bit longer?

197
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,745
We're having dinner now.
I really should go.

198
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,415
You know I love you very much.

199
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,507
Okay. Bye, Helen.

200
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,702
Is that a cell phone?

201
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:04,827
Can I borrow it?

202
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,300
What are the odds
of an asteroid...

203
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,502
making impact in Manhattan?

204
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,102
Astronomical.

205
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,622
Plus, there's no
light signature.

206
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:18,862
Then it can't be an asteroid.

207
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,200
- A primordial
black hole, perhaps.

208
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,462
Do you know what
that would mean?

209
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,702
Look, whatever it is,
if this object is moving...

210
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:25,233
at three times 10
- to-the-seventh...

211
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,022
meters per second,

212
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:28,027
there will be no aftermath.

213
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,452
If they can't stop
it before it hits,

214
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,777
there will be nothing
left but dust.

215
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,940
It will sterilize the Earth.
This is all theater.

216
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,622
They're saying we lost
launch capability.

217
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:40,857
What? How?
- What does that mean?

218
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,336
- The missile's disabled.
- Disabled by what?

219
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:44,319
- They don't know.

220
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,862
But they can
restore it, right?

221
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:48,779
There's a fallback.
They have to launch.

222
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,983
Object impact in seven, six...

223
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,278
'Our father, who
art in heaven,

224
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,102
hallowed be thy name.

225
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:00,324
'Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,

226
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:01,342
on Earth as it is in heaven...

227
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:04,145
...three, two, one...
- '...Give us this day...'

228
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:13,070
- Where is it?

229
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,502
Could they have
made a mistake?

230
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,896
Wait. Roger that.

231
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:17,689
They're saying...

232
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:19,142
the object's still
in its approach.

233
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:21,347
Well, then, where is it?
- It's slowing down.

234
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,861
Awesome.
- Slowing down?

235
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,866
I see it.

236
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:30,206
Radiation levels are
slightly elevated,

237
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:31,981
but it's not dangerous.

238
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,625
I'm getting a lot of
electrostatic interference.

239
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:36,706
Yeah, me too.

240
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:40,946
Did you feel that?

241
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,826
Feel what?

242
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,866
I feel it.

243
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,506
It's close.

244
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,581
Checkmate 0-6,
who has tactical command here?

245
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,166
This is 2917. I need to know...

246
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,171
who has jurisdiction
on this site.

247
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,577
Checkmate 0-3,

248
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:49,544
this is Gator 2-3.
We're blind here.

249
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:52,618
Checkmate 0-6,
do you copy? Over.

250
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,101
What the hell is that thing?

251
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,106
I need the rules
of engagement now.

252
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:01,981
Target is advancing.

253
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:05,183
Target is advancing.
Repeat, target is advancing.

254
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,540
Sniper team is in place.

255
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,422
Sniper team leaders,
come back. I repeat...

256
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,102
Do not fire.
- It's coming right at us.

257
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,861
It's coming out.

258
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,300
Hold your fire.
- Do we engage?

259
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,226
Hold your fire.
- Fire.

260
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,941
- Cease fire.
- All stations, cease fire.

261
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:37,460
Don't shoot. Don't
shoot. Do not shoot.

262
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,826
We need a medic.

263
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:40,018
Klaatu barada nikto.

264
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,623
We need that DNA
swab. DNA swab now.

265
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:15,425
- It's soaking through.
- Where's the O2? Stat.

266
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:17,506
Get me the O2, stat.

267
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,626
Go. No one else.

268
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,941
What am I supposed to do now?
Do I start an IV?

269
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,421
No, no. We don't
know its physiology.

270
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,021
For all we know, the
fluids may kill it.

271
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:38,541
What do I do, then?
What do I do?

272
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,221
Its blood is red.
It must have hemoglobin.

273
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:41,854
- Okay, she's right.
Start the drip.

274
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,261
Okay. I... I
can't find a vein.

275
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,505
- It doesn't have any veins.

276
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,060
Look for a central
line site, then.

277
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,340
Going into cardiac arrest.
Do I defib?

278
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:49,710
- Yeah, get in
there now. Go. Go.

279
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:51,715
Clear.

280
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,684
- The monitor
just shorted out.

281
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,420
Heart rate is stabilizing.
It's stabilizing.

282
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:58,495
What now? What now?

283
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:03,145
Do you have a surgeon?

284
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,560
Normally, for a gunshot,

285
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:08,864
we'd be using a
general anesthetic.

286
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,181
But, as we don't know
how the patient will react.

287
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:18,174
I have opted for a local.

288
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:23,180
I'm making the
first incision now.

289
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:30,777
No explosions.
So far, so good.

290
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,185
Pale flesh,

291
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,384
a texture something akin to...

292
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,380
What?

293
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,220
Whale blubber.

294
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:44,225
I'm taking a specimen now.

295
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:47,361
Pack that on ice
and chopper it...

296
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,542
to a genomics lab
for DNA mapping.

297
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,625
I'd like a sample
of that as well.

298
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:55,140
I am entering
the wound, and...

299
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,465
My God.

300
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:02,460
What is this?

301
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:05,104
I'm sorry. I'm a
little taken aback.

302
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,693
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

303
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:10,379
That's the thing.
It's all so familiar.

304
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:13,244
The outer layer of
the flesh is exotic,

305
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:14,260
it's strange,

306
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,808
but as I go deeper,

307
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:18,577
there's muscle,
vein, nerve, bone.

308
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,618
I'm extracting the bullet.

309
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,357
This gray flesh,

310
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,938
it seems to be
just falling away.

311
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:38,335
It's... It's removing itself.

312
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,058
I think I need to
keep extracting it.

313
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:45,945
Yes. Continue.

314
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,380
Can you explain any of this?

315
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,265
It's dreaming.

316
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,940
Any signs of neural activity?

317
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,743
It lit up the fMRI
like Times Square.

318
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,185
Get help.

319
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,493
Code white. Subject
is conscious.

320
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:03,065
Help.

321
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,422
It's looking at you.
Try saying something to it.

322
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,065
My name is Dr. Helen Benson.

323
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,260
We're trying to help you.

324
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,574
You have nothing
to fear from us.

325
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:22,665
Help you.

326
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,025
Nothing to fear.

327
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,395
Global markets are...

328
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,140
panicked in early
trading this morning...

329
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:31,245
in response to the
crisis in Central Park.

330
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:32,391
Trading has been halted...

331
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,740
on the New York
Stock Exchange,

332
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,726
the Nikkei and Hang
Seng, as Manhattan...

333
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,460
prepares for a
massive evacuation.

334
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,020
In other cities
around the world,

335
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,010
people are voluntarily
evacuating...

336
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:42,140
population centers,

337
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,100
fearing that the sphere
in Central Park...

338
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,063
may be the vanguard...

339
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,420
of an impending
alien invasion.

340
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,178
The President and Vice
President have...

341
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,980
been taken to separate,
secure locations.

342
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:52,658
Until this situation
has some kind of resolve.

343
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:55,703
I am the eyes and the ears
of the Presidency.

344
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:57,500
So, what do we know?

345
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:59,420
Madam Secretary,
we lost contact...

346
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:00,552
with one of our DSCS-3...

347
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,180
listening satellites
orbiting Earth.

348
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,300
What is that image?

349
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:04,279
Are you saying that sphere...

350
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:05,460
in Central Park
isn't the only one?

351
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:07,380
In fact, we have intelligence
that smaller spheres...

352
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,580
have landed at other locations
around the world.

353
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,100
Do we have briefings on that?
And, General,

354
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,221
where exactly
are these spheres right now?

355
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:16,297
I think we're asking
the wrong questions.

356
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,340
What questions
should we be asking?

357
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,660
Well, let's start with this.
Where is our satellite?

358
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,180
We lost contact with it.

359
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:24,060
In the scheme of things,
the loss of one satellite...

360
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:25,713
- isn't necessarily
our concern.

361
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:26,180
DSCS-3...

362
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,904
stands for 'Defense Systems
Communication Satellite.'

363
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:30,900
Remember what it
communicates with?

364
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:32,250
They were able to access our...

365
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:33,860
defense mainframe
via that satellite.

366
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:35,307
That's how they
temporarily shut down...

367
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:36,140
our missile defenses...

368
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:37,260
and entered our airspace.

369
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,859
We've changed all the codes.
- And on top of that,

370
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,216
there is a vast amount...

371
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,255
of vital intelligence
on that mainframe.

372
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,540
They know everything
about us now.

373
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,460
- And we know
nothing about them.

374
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:48,380
Almost nothing.

375
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:50,260
The fact that they chose
to disable our defenses...

376
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:52,620
tells us something
about their intentions.

377
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:57,852
Madam Secretary,

378
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,180
we brought in several
specialists...

379
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,420
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being.

380
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:04,144
This is our chief geneticist,
Dr. Hideo Ikegawa.

381
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,618
This is our chief
astrobiologist.

382
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:06,340
Dr. Helen Benson.

383
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,345
- Hello.
- Doctor?

384
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,861
The being is in
a nascent state.

385
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,890
The DNA samples
we've taken seem...

386
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:15,063
to represent three
distinct life forms.

387
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:17,215
- Three different DNA types?

388
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,661
Yes, including
the being's brain.

389
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:23,135
The body tissue is human,
as far as we can tell.

390
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,540
The gray flesh encasing it...

391
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,960
is organic material,

392
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,584
some kind of
bioengineered spacesuit.

393
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:30,581
What it resembles,
oddly enough,

394
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:31,860
is placental tissue.

395
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,908
Which makes sense,
given the placenta's...

396
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,060
a life-support system.

397
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:35,820
And that, basically,

398
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:37,300
in order to survive
in our environment,

399
00:29:37,305 --> 00:29:40,854
the being had to be born here,
in its human form.

400
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,300
They must have come
here in the past...

401
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:45,422
and obtained a DNA sample
from a human subject.

402
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:46,991
Now, since that birth,

403
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:49,293
the being has grown
exponentially.

404
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,340
This is one hour
after surgery.

405
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,105
Three hours.

406
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:57,620
Six hours.

407
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,648
How much can you
tell us about it...

408
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,860
by decoding its DNA?

409
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,135
You don't understand.

410
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,100
These are the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

411
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:05,180
Geneticists are gonna be...

412
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:06,580
studying this code
for generations.

413
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,700
No, they aren't.

414
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,820
This code is the property
of the US government.

415
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:12,737
Its very existence
is classified.

416
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,825
I want to see it.

417
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,345
Water.

418
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:28,540
Bring him up.

419
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,404
Does it actually
speak our language?

420
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,424
Or does it just parrot
what it's heard?

421
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:35,542
No, it seems to already
understand our language.

422
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,891
They've compromised
our satellites.

423
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:37,980
They know everything about us.

424
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,985
Mr. Driscoll.

425
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:07,059
My name is Regina Jackson.

426
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:09,067
I'm the Secretary of Defense...

427
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:11,072
of the United
States of America.

428
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,462
This body will take
some getting used to.

429
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,858
I've been sent here
to determine...

430
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:24,219
who or what you represent,

431
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:26,499
and what your intentions are.

432
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:29,704
It feels unreal to me.

433
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:34,664
Alien.

434
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,339
It will take time to adapt.

435
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,023
What were you before
you were human?

436
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,019
Different.

437
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,024
Different how?

438
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:53,620
It would only frighten you.

439
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,864
Do you have a name?

440
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:00,264
Klaatu.

441
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,693
Do you represent
a civilization?

442
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:09,941
I represent a group
of civilizations.

443
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:12,458
Where is this group
of civilizations?

444
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,544
All around you.

445
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,859
What is your purpose
in coming here?

446
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:19,444
There is a gathering
of world leaders...

447
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,659
not far from here.

448
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:23,098
I will explain my
purpose to them.

449
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:25,744
I'm afraid that's
not possible.

450
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,950
Perhaps you should
explain yourself...

451
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:28,819
to me instead.

452
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,622
Do you speak for the
entire human race?

453
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:32,615
I speak for...

454
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,901
the President of
the United States.

455
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:38,755
Now, please, tell me,

456
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,217
why have you come
to our planet?

457
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:45,499
Your planet?

458
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:47,859
Yes. This is our planet.

459
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,424
No. It is not.

460
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,908
We've decided to sedate him...

461
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,052
and move him to a
more secure location.

462
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,713
- Are you going to
interrogate him?

463
00:32:58,718 --> 00:32:59,659
That's a possibility.

464
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:01,406
Madam Secretary,
as scientists,

465
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:02,899
we can't consent to this.

466
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:05,259
He says he wants to
speak to the UN.

467
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,179
History has lessons
to teach us...

468
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:10,142
about first encounters
between civilizations.

469
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,534
As a rule, the less
advanced civilization...

470
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,459
is either exterminated
or enslaved.

471
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,799
I'm thinking of
Pizarro and the Incas.

472
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:19,015
Columbus and the
Native Americans...

473
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,899
The list goes on.

474
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:22,675
Unfortunately, in this case,

475
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,022
the less advanced
civilization is us.

476
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,574
This is a representative...

477
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,579
of an extraterrestrial
civilization.

478
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,482
This is the most
important discovery...

479
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:31,739
in the history of mankind.

480
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,551
It may well be the
last discovery...

481
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:34,939
in the history of mankind.

482
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:36,704
We need to know what
they're planning,

483
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:37,819
and we need to know now.

484
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:41,055
So you want to drug him?
Interrogate him?

485
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,499
I'm sorry, we won't do that.
Do you understand?

486
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,700
I understand completely.

487
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:46,910
Of course, if you won't do it,

488
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:48,379
we'll have to call
in someone who will.

489
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,115
Well, I'm sure...

490
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,499
you can find
someone who will...

491
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,504
I'll do it.

492
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,259
Helen.

493
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:57,264
I'll do it.

494
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:23,218
That won't be
necessary, Doctor.

495
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:26,262
We've already prepared
the solution for you.

496
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:30,064
I just need a syringe.

497
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,784
I want to apologize to you.

498
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,176
It seems we got
off to a bad start.

499
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:46,859
It seems we did.

500
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:49,139
We're going to transport you
to a different facility...

501
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:52,102
- for better medical care.
- No, you are not.

502
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:55,013
- Excuse me?
- I am leaving.

503
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:57,379
I can't allow you to do that.

504
00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:58,860
- It is not up to you.

505
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:01,013
This is a military
installation.

506
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:03,413
You're surrounded by
hundreds of soldiers.

507
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,939
There's no leaving here.

508
00:35:04,944 --> 00:35:06,499
I have done nothing wrong.

509
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,859
You invaded our airspace.

510
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:11,902
That automaton
that emerged from the sphere,

511
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,379
it attacked our troops.

512
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,299
It acted to defend me.

513
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:17,738
It activates in the
presence of violence.

514
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,824
Dr. Benson? Please.

515
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,504
Run.

516
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,544
It's done.

517
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:50,133
If you'll come
with us, ma'am...

518
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:13,704
Keep moving, please.

519
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:04,614
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

520
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:11,741
Are you currently in
a seated position?

521
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,259
Yes.

522
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:17,264
Are you human?

523
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:20,504
My body is.

524
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,584
Do you feel pain?

525
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:26,384
My body does.

526
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,340
Are you aware of an
impending attack...

527
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:36,264
on the planet Earth?

528
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:41,584
You should let me go.

529
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,700
I'll repeat the question.

530
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:17,622
What gate did you use
to enter this base?

531
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:19,099
East loading door.

532
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,140
How do I get there?

533
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:22,542
One hundred yards left...

534
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,259
from the back of
this building.

535
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,334
Is there a security code?

536
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,372
Four-four-Bravo-three-zero.

537
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:33,377
What size is that suit?

538
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,178
Forty-two long.

539
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:37,183
Take it off.

540
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,263
Attention.
All security personnel...

541
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,138
report to your
designated posts.

542
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,690
All civilian personnel...

543
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,738
report to Operations
immediately.

544
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,902
- I'm leaving you now.
- No.

545
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:02,898
Put every arm of
the government,

546
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,411
military, law enforcement,

547
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,737
Federal, state and
local, on high alert.

548
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,555
- If the media gets
word that we lost...

549
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,338
Use a cover story.

550
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,978
We can't risk a panic.

551
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:12,618
Call him an escaped convict.

552
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,574
Use every surveillance
satellite,

553
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,898
every drone aircraft,

554
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:19,020
every freeway camera.
Use every resource we've got.

555
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,138
Attention:
All scheduled trains...

556
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:31,101
into and out of Penn
Station Manhattan...

557
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:33,651
are canceled due to
the ongoing evacuation...

558
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,303
and the security
perimeter in Central Park.

559
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,578
We ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly...

560
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,538
during these difficult
circumstances.

561
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,329
Any disturbance
will be subject...

562
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:49,334
to immediate arrest
by Transit police.

563
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:51,423
Excuse me. Excuse me.

564
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:56,517
We are committed...

565
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,298
to providing you
quality service.

566
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:00,303
Thank you.

567
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:06,644
We ask that our...

568
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:08,338
passengers remain
calm and orderly...

569
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,096
during these difficult
circumstances.

570
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:18,081
Any disturbance
will be subject...

571
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:20,341
to immediate arrest
by Transit police.

572
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:23,733
You're not getting the ticket.
All right, back off.

573
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:25,765
- Don't push me.
I want the ticket.

574
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,738
Look, I don't...

575
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:29,743
- Now just give me the ticket.
- I'm not giving you anything.

576
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:32,661
Give me the...
What's the matter with you?

577
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,034
Rising global unrest...

578
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,858
is causing leaders
around the world...

579
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:54,173
to criticize the US response
to the arrival of the spheres.

580
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,498
Reactions from both
national and international...

581
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:58,258
religious communities
have been varied.

582
00:41:58,263 --> 00:41:59,434
While some have responded...

583
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:00,778
with hope and
measured optimism,

584
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:02,432
most religious
communities have...

585
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,437
considered recent
events as apocalyptic.

586
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,073
At gatherings and
prayer vigils...

587
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:07,498
in virtually every major city,

588
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:10,063
many see the arrival
of the Central Park sphere...

589
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:11,318
as a sign of a new era,

590
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,323
or perhaps even the
end of the world.

591
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,506
The rapture, the tribulation...

592
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:17,538
and the impending
battle of Armageddon...

593
00:42:17,543 --> 00:42:19,932
dominate much of
the discussion.

594
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:35,653
Leaders around the world...

595
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,098
are protesting the
US's decision...

596
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:40,812
to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being.

597
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:42,698
Have you done your homework?

598
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:45,217
School's canceled on
account of the aliens.

599
00:42:45,303 --> 00:42:47,817
- They say it's an invasion.
- Well, they're wrong.

600
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:50,292
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

601
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:52,898
Don't get that.

602
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,738
- Jacob.
- Hello?

603
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:57,257
May I speak
to Dr. Helen Benson, please?

604
00:42:57,343 --> 00:42:59,343
It's for you.

605
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,898
- Hello?
- Dr. Helen Benson?

606
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:04,258
- Yes.

607
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,463
I'm calling from
Newark Penn Station.

608
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,773
We've got your patient here.

609
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:10,458
Oh, um...

610
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,851
Sorry, I think there's
been a mistake.

611
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,818
I'm not that kind of a doctor.

612
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,939
Hold... Hold on a second.

613
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,543
He says you got his medicine.

614
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:23,578
I'll be right there.

615
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,288
and stressed...

616
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:26,293
the need for calm
and understanding...

617
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,339
Sorry. Excuse me?

618
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:35,946
Excuse me. I'm sorry, someone...

619
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:37,538
called me. My
name's Dr. Benson.

620
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,578
Okay, he's over there.
He's your problem now.

621
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,336
Go ahead, take him.
He's your problem.

622
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:56,324
Evacuation registration point...

623
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,938
is located two
blocks this way.

624
00:43:57,943 --> 00:44:01,731
You know, I took a huge risk
back at the hospital.

625
00:44:01,823 --> 00:44:03,823
Did I make a mistake?

626
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:06,778
Are you a friend to us?

627
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:08,979
I'm a friend to the Earth.

628
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:15,178
Let's keep it steady, folks.
Let's keep going forward.

629
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,898
Hello.

630
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:24,578
Hi.

631
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,583
Okay.

632
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:29,058
- Now what?
- Drive.

633
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:47,703
Look in your pocket.

634
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,303
Your inside pocket.

635
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,463
Turn left.

636
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:41,013
Striker 2829,
descend and maintain 2,000...

637
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:43,219
to established vectors
to the target area.

638
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:45,698
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

639
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,633
All right, everybody,
we got our mission.

640
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,198
All right, target acquired and...

641
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:51,698
confirmed, sir.
We are locked on.

642
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:54,421
Madam Secretary,
they're sending in the drones.

643
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,538
Bring in the
Reapers. We have go.

644
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,818
- Roger that.
Descending to 1,200.

645
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,823
Let's light this thing up.

646
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:11,897
Arm your Sidewinder missiles.

647
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:15,936
Roger that, Colonel.
Sidewinder missiles armed.

648
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:27,135
- He's activating.
- Fire. Fire, fire.

649
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:34,531
- Missiles intercepted.
- Get out of there.

650
00:46:34,622 --> 00:46:36,457
Withdraw and realign
for another sortie.

651
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:39,613
Negative. I've lost
link. I've lost control.

652
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:44,741
Who's in control of
the aircraft, then?

653
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:48,462
Striker 28 headed
for orb perimeter.

654
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:50,467
I am out of control.

655
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,102
Anyone got any other ideas?

656
00:47:03,742 --> 00:47:07,098
Why are people running?
We should stay and fight.

657
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,412
They didn't come
here to hurt us.

658
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,671
Well, we should
kill them anyway,

659
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:13,937
just to make sure.

660
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,061
Don't say that.

661
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,457
That's what Dad
would have done.

662
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:19,942
I think he would have looked
for a different way.

663
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:22,297
He would have fought.

664
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,970
- I like to think I
knew him pretty well.

665
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,058
I knew him, too.
Longer than you.

666
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:29,737
What do you think?

667
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,137
Of what?

668
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:34,452
Should people run,
or should we stay and fight?

669
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:37,136
- Neither.
- What should we do, then?

670
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:40,017
There's nothing you can do.

671
00:47:41,302 --> 00:47:43,975
This is it. Pull in here.

672
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,782
McDonald's?

673
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,534
Where are you going?
Jacob, where are you going?

674
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:02,622
To the bathroom.

675
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:08,252
Where is the boy's father?

676
00:48:10,142 --> 00:48:12,097
He's dead.

677
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:14,102
How did he die?

678
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,182
He was in the Army.

679
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:19,501
So the boy wishes his
soldier father were...

680
00:48:19,506 --> 00:48:21,891
here to rescue the
world from the aliens.

681
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,833
The boy wishes his
father were here...

682
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:24,937
for a lot of reasons,

683
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:27,297
aliens being the
least of them.

684
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,786
He wasn't even that
kind of a soldier.

685
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,417
He was an engineer.

686
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:38,620
He went over there to
build, not to fight.

687
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:40,702
And his mother?

688
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:44,137
She died when he was a baby.

689
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:49,653
I married his father.
A year ago, he was killed.

690
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:55,302
Why did you come here?

691
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:58,737
I came to save the Earth.

692
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:01,902
From what?

693
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,942
He's here.

694
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:16,740
Your tea, Grandfather.

695
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:18,982
Thank you.

696
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:31,572
Are you one of them?

697
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:33,662
One of who?

698
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:37,502
Never mind. Sorry.

699
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:40,137
You've been out of
contact for a long time.

700
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:43,222
I had a dangerous assignment.

701
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:45,452
This is hostile territory.

702
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,217
I've noticed.

703
00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:50,373
I was hoping I could
reason with them.

704
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,422
I'm afraid they are
not a reasonable race.

705
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:58,457
I've been living amongst them
for seventy years now.

706
00:49:58,702 --> 00:50:00,702
I know them well.

707
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:03,017
And?

708
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:05,775
Any attempt to intercede with
them would be futile.

709
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:08,382
They are destructive,

710
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:11,098
and they won't change.

711
00:50:12,902 --> 00:50:15,894
Is that your official report?

712
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:18,370
The tragedy is, they know...

713
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,931
what's going to
become of them.

714
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:24,822
They sense it.

715
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:27,930
But they can't seem
to do anything about it.

716
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:35,771
It's decided then.

717
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:39,502
I'll begin the process
as soon as possible.

718
00:50:40,382 --> 00:50:42,691
We should make preparations
for our departure.

719
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:45,262
I'm staying.

720
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,542
You can't stay here.

721
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:49,782
I can, and I will.

722
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:52,850
- If you stay, you'll die.
- I know.

723
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:56,902
This is my home now.

724
00:50:58,382 --> 00:51:01,374
You yourself called them
a destructive race.

725
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:03,462
That's true.

726
00:51:03,982 --> 00:51:06,496
But, still, there
is another side.

727
00:51:08,062 --> 00:51:11,054
You see, I... I love them.

728
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:15,771
This is a very strange thing.

729
00:51:17,462 --> 00:51:20,738
I can't find a way to
explain it to you. I...

730
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:22,304
For many years, I...

731
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:25,054
I cursed my luck
for being sent here.

732
00:51:26,462 --> 00:51:28,498
Human life is difficult.

733
00:51:30,222 --> 00:51:32,975
But as this life is
coming to an end.

734
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:38,135
I consider myself
lucky to have lived it.

735
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:46,012
No sudden movements.
No aggressive...

736
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:48,257
actions. No matter
what happens,

737
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:49,697
no gunfire.

738
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:50,792
Track is in place, sir.

739
00:51:50,797 --> 00:51:52,457
Containment panels
are in position.

740
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:55,454
- We're ready on your order.
- On my command,

741
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:58,382
move the panels into place.

742
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,021
- Three, two...
- Three, two...

743
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:02,617
...one.

744
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:05,534
Synchronize established,
ISI ready to copy.

745
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:16,278
Containment panels...

746
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:19,138
are secure, and
we're still here.

747
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:28,977
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

748
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,537
The escaped convict
they showed on the news,

749
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:32,267
- I just saw the guy
at the gas station.

750
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:33,177
Can you describe him?

751
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:34,817
He was in a little car,
on the south block...

752
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,377
9- 1-1, what is
your emergency?

753
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:38,217
I just saw that wanted man
over by the McDonald's.

754
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,497
Can you
describe the car, sir?

755
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:40,937
Silver four-door,
with a woman and a kid.

756
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:41,999
I need 3 units to look...

757
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:43,697
for a silver Honda
near Ochada orchards.

758
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,385
3-1 responding.

759
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,217
We are patrolling the
orchards off I-67.

760
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:48,222
HP-28, follow up.

761
00:52:48,902 --> 00:52:52,258
This is it. Stop here.

762
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:55,902
You shouldn't...

763
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:03,255
Uh, Helen? Who is this guy?

764
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:05,776
A friend.
- What kind of friend?

765
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:10,576
Scootch over. He's
a work friend.

766
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:14,582
What's his name?

767
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:16,896
- Klaatu.
- Klaatu?

768
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:19,369
- Yeah.
- What kind of name is that?

769
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:22,061
It's foreign, I think.

770
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,073
- I never heard you
talk about him before.

771
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,016
I haven't known
him for very long.

772
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:30,330
We're just giving him a ride.

773
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:32,421
Where?

774
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:36,129
- Here.
- The forest?

775
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:42,136
Stay here.

776
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:44,100
I want you to lock
the door, okay?

777
00:53:44,105 --> 00:53:46,180
And don't open it
for anyone but me.

778
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:48,261
I'm serious.

779
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:21,381
Helen, what's going on?

780
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:28,580
We're getting images
of these spheres...

781
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,376
from all over the world.

782
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:31,256
Okavango, Kobe, Baku...

783
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:33,016
Which of our agencies
gathered this intel?

784
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:34,405
Ma'am, none of them.

785
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,696
We pulled these
off the Internet.

786
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:44,050
Is that them?

787
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:48,100
No. It's us.

788
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,620
Those are ordinary
cephalopods.

789
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,701
Squid. Octopus.

790
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:59,128
I don't like him.
He's weird, and...

791
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:01,695
Why are we driving
him around, anyway?

792
00:57:02,421 --> 00:57:04,421
Um...

793
00:57:05,941 --> 00:57:08,136
It's complicated.

794
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:10,136
Is he coming home with us?

795
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:12,096
No. No.

796
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:14,573
Well, what if you
decide you like him...

797
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:16,456
and he wants to move in?

798
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:18,577
No, it's not like
that. God, no.

799
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:20,216
Listen to me.

800
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:22,416
No one is moving in.
You don't understand.

801
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:25,061
Whatever. You wait for him.
I'm going home.

802
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,141
Jacob.

803
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,381
Jacob.

804
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,541
Jacob.

805
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:39,411
What is the matter with you?

806
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:14,421
These spheres
now appear to be leaving...

807
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:16,136
in the same mysterious manner
as they came.

808
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:17,976
Hopefully this mass exodus
will bring an end...

809
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:19,068
to the panic and unrest...

810
00:58:19,073 --> 00:58:20,536
we've been seeing
around the world.

811
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:21,244
The only sphere...

812
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:22,656
that doesn't appear
to be leaving...

813
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:25,334
is the giant sphere
in Central Park.

814
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:28,136
You think we scared them off?

815
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,781
They're not afraid of us.

816
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:44,576
I need to get
back to the city.

817
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:47,175
Not till you tell
me what's going on.

818
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:50,333
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

819
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:52,730
Jacob, get in the car.

820
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,733
- He's one of them.
- Please get in the car.

821
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,101
Get in the car.

822
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:12,700
I need to know
what's happening.

823
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:15,056
This planet is dying.

824
00:59:15,141 --> 00:59:17,141
The human race is killing it.

825
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:19,570
So you've come
here to help us.

826
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,261
No, I didn't.

827
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:26,576
You said you came to save us.

828
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:28,936
I said I came to
save the Earth.

829
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:31,171
You came to save the Earth...

830
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:34,421
from us.

831
00:59:35,381 --> 00:59:38,020
You came to save
the Earth from us.

832
00:59:38,101 --> 00:59:40,858
We can't risk the survival
of this planet...

833
00:59:40,863 --> 00:59:42,696
for the sake of one species.

834
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:45,374
- What are you saying?
- If the Earth dies, you die.

835
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:48,180
If you die, the
Earth survives.

836
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,728
There are only a
handful of planets...

837
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:51,416
in the cosmos...

838
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,456
that are capable
of supporting complex life.

839
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:54,515
- You can't do this.

840
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,496
This one can't be
allowed to perish.

841
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:57,395
We can change.

842
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,573
We could still turn
things around.

843
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:00,870
We've watched, we've waited,

844
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,256
and hoped that
you would change.

845
01:00:02,261 --> 01:00:02,626
- Please.

846
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:03,896
It's reached the
tipping point.

847
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,216
- We have to act.
- Please.

848
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:06,536
We'll undo the damage
you've done...

849
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:09,009
and give the Earth a chance
to begin again.

850
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:13,333
Don't do this. Please.
We could change.

851
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:15,421
We can change.

852
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:19,937
The decision is made.
The process has begun.

853
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,661
Oh, God.

854
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,453
It won't make any
difference, Helen.

855
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,400
Even if they arrest me,
even if they kill me,

856
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:47,405
the process will continue.

857
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,212
Both of you, hands on
the car right now.

858
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,939
- Is that a child in the car?
- Yes.

859
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,719
This is HP-28. I'm on I-67.

860
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:59,257
I have the FBI
suspect in custody...

861
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,983
along with one adult female...

862
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:03,015
and one child.
Awaiting instructions.

863
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,295
70140, roger.

864
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,655
Tell the child to
get out of the car.

865
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,618
- Get the kid out of the car.
- Honey, come.

866
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,255
Okay, you two, over there.

867
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,660
You, I'm not going
to tell you again.

868
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:16,815
Hands on the car.

869
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,935
- Please don't hurt him.
- I'm not going to hurt him,

870
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,852
- so long as he...
- I wasn't talking to you.

871
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,140
The pain will only
last a moment.

872
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,639
You killed him.

873
01:01:39,644 --> 01:01:41,175
You killed him.
You killed him.

874
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,410
- Jacob. Jacob.
- Let me finish.

875
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,638
Shh. Shh.

876
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:48,330
You killed him.
You killed him.

877
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,934
- Come sit down.
- He killed him.

878
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,100
He'll be all right.

879
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,290
I don't understand.

880
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,609
You're going to kill us all,
but you saved him.

881
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,612
He was an obstacle.
I meant him no harm.

882
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,160
You could stop
this, couldn't you?

883
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:54,575
If you wanted to.

884
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,089
I tried to reason with you.

885
01:02:56,094 --> 01:02:58,094
I tried to speak
with your leaders.

886
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,449
Those aren't our leaders.

887
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,970
If you want to speak to one...

888
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:03,775
of our leaders, I'll
take you to one.

889
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,780
Let me take you.

890
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,820
Get in the car.

891
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,104
Maybe they were just...

892
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:16,855
collecting specimens
from our planet.

893
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,212
It's not our planet.

894
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:21,058
That's what he said to
me in the hospital.

895
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,940
An ark.

896
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,496
- Excuse me?
- It's an ark.

897
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,935
So are all the other spheres.

898
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,249
They're saving as many species
as they can.

899
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,219
If the sphere is an ark,
then what comes next is...

900
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,980
The flood.

901
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,940
Karl, we're here.

902
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,099
All right, let's
get you settled.

903
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,290
That's a Nobel Prize.

904
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,417
He won it for his work
on biological altruism.

905
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,593
Probably still be in
his desk drawer...

906
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:28,850
if I hadn't gotten
it framed for him.

907
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,816
- You tired?
- Just a little.

908
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,698
Close, but no.

909
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,780
I wouldn't.

910
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,820
He won't mind.

911
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,218
He's one of them.
You shouldn't be helping him.

912
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
We should stop him.

913
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,535
For just this once,
I need you to trust me.

914
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,060
Is it possible?

915
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,972
I have so many
questions to ask you.

916
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
It's Bach.

917
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,540
It's beautiful.

918
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,294
So we're not so
different after all.

919
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,580
I wish that were true.

920
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,095
So is it a machine
or a living thing?

921
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,012
- It's both, or neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

922
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,500
It seems to be some sort
of silicon-based hybrid.

923
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,793
We're calling it GORT,

924
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:50,135
Genetically Organized
Robotic Technology.

925
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,175
The military and
their acronyms.

926
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,095
We've used every
diagnostic method available.

927
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,107
MRI, thermal
imaging, PET scan,

928
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,615
but it was impervious.

929
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,401
So we attempted...

930
01:06:58,406 --> 01:07:00,015
a robotically-assisted
exploration...

931
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,735
- using a diamond drill.
- And?

932
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,740
The drill bit fractured.
It'll take...

933
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:05,741
24 hours to fix
it robotically.

934
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,302
Colonel, we don't
have 24 hours.

935
01:07:49,307 --> 01:07:52,128
Send somebody in there
to fix that drill.

936
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,058
Food and fuel hoarding...

937
01:07:54,063 --> 01:07:56,249
have led to shortages
which erupted...

938
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,048
into looting incidents
throughout Asia...

939
01:07:58,053 --> 01:07:59,135
and South America. Many...

940
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,735
... outbreaks of
rioting and unrest...

941
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,894
in such cities as
Guangdong, China.

942
01:08:01,899 --> 01:08:04,260
London, and Chicago
due to the shortages...

943
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:06,214
of such basic
commodities as fuel,

944
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:09,402
food and drinking
water. Many point to...

945
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:11,657
the Central Park sphere as...

946
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:12,888
Amidst the chaos...

947
01:08:12,893 --> 01:08:14,893
in the New York-New
Jersey areas,

948
01:08:14,979 --> 01:08:17,429
local police are looking
for an escaped convict...

949
01:08:17,459 --> 01:08:19,609
whose name is not
being released.

950
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:21,165
Authorities believe that he is...

951
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,814
a significant threat
to the public...

952
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:24,729
and are asking for
any information...

953
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,414
that could lead
to his capture.

954
01:08:26,419 --> 01:08:27,801
If you have seen this man,

955
01:08:27,806 --> 01:08:29,934
contact the number on
your screen below.

956
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:31,414
There must be alternatives.

957
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:34,377
You must have some technology
that could solve our problem.

958
01:08:34,459 --> 01:08:36,814
Your problem is
not technology.

959
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:40,255
The problem is you.
You lack the will to change.

960
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:41,814
Then help us change.

961
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,734
I cannot change your nature.

962
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:45,889
You treat the world
as you treat each other.

963
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:47,857
But every civilization...

964
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,416
reaches a crisis
point eventually.

965
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:53,889
- Most of them don't make it.
- Yours did. How?

966
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:55,008
Our sun was dying.

967
01:08:55,013 --> 01:08:57,130
We had to evolve in
order to survive.

968
01:08:57,219 --> 01:08:58,711
So it was only when your world...

969
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:00,254
was threatened with
destruction...

970
01:09:00,259 --> 01:09:02,768
- that you became
what you are now.

971
01:09:02,773 --> 01:09:03,134
Yes.

972
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,139
Well, that's where we are.

973
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:06,596
You say we're on the brink...

974
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,174
of destruction,
and you're right.

975
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:10,171
But it's only on the brink...

976
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:12,650
that people find
the will to change.

977
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:15,651
Only at the precipice
do we evolve.

978
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:18,894
This is our moment.

979
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:22,050
Don't take it from us.
We're close to an answer.

980
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:30,299
What's wrong?

981
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:51,179
Jacob. Can you
get your boots on?

982
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:55,694
He can't get caught.
What do I do?

983
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:56,890
Change his mind.

984
01:09:56,895 --> 01:09:59,328
Not with reason,
but with yourself.

985
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:12,929
It's too late for that.

986
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:43,419
Jacob.

987
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:46,414
Down here. He's here.

988
01:10:46,419 --> 01:10:48,808
- Down here. He's here.
- What are you doing?

989
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:51,572
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to help them.

990
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:53,614
- That's why I called them.
- What?

991
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:56,087
- I told them where we are.
- Jacob, you didn't.

992
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:58,166
- We shouldn't be helping him.

993
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,171
Jacob, I'm trying to help us.

994
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:01,039
We should kill him.

995
01:11:01,044 --> 01:11:02,494
That's what Dad
would have done.

996
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:04,446
- You fight me on
everything. Everything.

997
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:05,494
If my dad were here...

998
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:07,808
But he isn't here. He's gone.

999
01:11:13,099 --> 01:11:15,099
Jacob...

1000
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:21,730
We've extracted the female.
Returning to base.

1001
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:33,257
- Got a visual on the male.
- Yeah, I see him.

1002
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:35,492
Yep, got him.

1003
01:11:35,497 --> 01:11:38,055
Target acquired.
Permission to engage.

1004
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:40,918
You are clear to engage.

1005
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:43,048
You are go to take
out the target.

1006
01:11:43,139 --> 01:11:45,139
Roger that.

1007
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,939
Please don't hurt me.

1008
01:12:33,339 --> 01:12:35,339
Thanks.

1009
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,895
I don't know where we are.

1010
01:12:50,059 --> 01:12:52,095
Can you help me get home?

1011
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:00,539
This way.

1012
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:41,878
- He's come to
exterminate us, hasn't he?

1013
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:43,014
You can't stop him.

1014
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,738
The only chance we have
is if he changes his mind.

1015
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:47,614
You have to let
me talk to him.

1016
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:49,254
What makes you think
he'll listen to you?

1017
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,569
I don't know that he will.
But I think he trusts me.

1018
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:54,659
And I don't think he
wants to do this.

1019
01:13:54,979 --> 01:13:56,414
We have the situation
under control.

1020
01:13:56,419 --> 01:13:57,641
Madam Secretary, General Quinn...

1021
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,054
needs to see you in
the briefing room.

1022
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,059
He says it's urgent.

1023
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,358
You're not in control.

1024
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:05,818
You don't know what
he's capable of.

1025
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:09,333
But she didn't do
anything wrong.

1026
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:11,451
So they should
let her go, right?

1027
01:14:12,259 --> 01:14:14,727
You are afraid
you're going to be left alone.

1028
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,454
I already am alone.

1029
01:14:16,459 --> 01:14:18,976
Helen's just someone
that was stuck with...

1030
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:20,981
me when my dad died. You know?

1031
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:26,407
Oh, I forgot. You're an alien.
You don't understand anything.

1032
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:35,699
We're good to go.

1033
01:14:45,059 --> 01:14:47,059
Hold it.

1034
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:51,939
Your sleeve.

1035
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:54,179
Oh...

1036
01:14:56,179 --> 01:14:58,329
Let... Let me out.

1037
01:14:58,419 --> 01:14:59,654
- Open the airlock.
- No.

1038
01:14:59,659 --> 01:15:01,454
- Open the door.
- Then we have to flash.

1039
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:04,019
- Our protocol...
- I decide what protocol is.

1040
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,454
Open the door. Let me out.

1041
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:09,730
- Reset the drill.
- Let me out. Open it.

1042
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:11,694
I said, reset the drill.

1043
01:15:11,699 --> 01:15:15,009
Let me out. Let me
out. Open the door.

1044
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:17,899
Let me out.

1045
01:15:25,138 --> 01:15:27,138
Sir, the restraints.

1046
01:16:18,898 --> 01:16:21,492
Open the door. Open the door.

1047
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,933
This facility has been sealed.

1048
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:29,538
No one leaves.

1049
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,655
We've lost contact
with the flash chamber, sir.

1050
01:17:00,338 --> 01:17:02,488
Whiskey Task Force, engage.

1051
01:17:24,818 --> 01:17:27,093
Were there any survivors?
- No.

1052
01:17:27,818 --> 01:17:29,818
As you know, at 0524 hours,

1053
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:30,926
our pilots launched a salvo...

1054
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:32,213
of Sidewinder
air-to-air missiles...

1055
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:34,686
- into the heart of the mass.
- And?

1056
01:17:34,778 --> 01:17:36,778
Every strike made it larger.

1057
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:39,372
And this mass,
where is it heading?

1058
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,138
Everywhere.

1059
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:34,007
- Dr. Benson.
- Madam Secretary, please.

1060
01:18:34,098 --> 01:18:36,514
I don't want to die
here in this room...

1061
01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:38,694
without seeing my
son one more time.

1062
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:42,172
Do you really think
you can persuade him?

1063
01:18:42,258 --> 01:18:44,726
I think you should let me try.

1064
01:18:48,298 --> 01:18:49,973
Go on, then.

1065
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:51,600
But I make you no promises.

1066
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:53,605
I still answer to
the President.

1067
01:18:53,618 --> 01:18:55,022
- You're on your own.

1068
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:57,167
No, she's not.
I'll go with you.

1069
01:18:58,698 --> 01:19:00,698
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1070
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,458
It doesn't work.

1071
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:34,018
Go ahead.

1072
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:42,978
It's me. Are you okay?

1073
01:19:44,498 --> 01:19:46,498
I'm fine.

1074
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:49,178
He's right here.

1075
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:51,728
She wants to talk to you.

1076
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:54,978
Yes.

1077
01:19:54,978 --> 01:19:57,651
I need to get
back to the city.

1078
01:19:57,738 --> 01:19:58,049
- Yes.

1079
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:00,054
Tell her I know where
we can meet her.

1080
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:16,126
I told Helen we
should kill you.

1081
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:19,178
Yes, I heard that.

1082
01:20:19,218 --> 01:20:22,255
- I didn't mean it, though.
- You didn't?

1083
01:20:22,338 --> 01:20:24,338
Well, not anymore.

1084
01:20:30,578 --> 01:20:32,887
So what's gonna happen to us?

1085
01:20:35,378 --> 01:20:38,017
I was just wondering
the same thing.

1086
01:20:45,698 --> 01:20:48,337
- End of the world.
- Good luck.

1087
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:53,215
This is it. This is where
we're supposed to meet her.

1088
01:20:53,298 --> 01:20:55,298
Come on.

1089
01:21:03,538 --> 01:21:05,574
Hurry up. It's this way.

1090
01:21:37,178 --> 01:21:40,648
You can do this. Just
like with the trooper.

1091
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:44,888
There are some
things I can't do.

1092
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:46,978
But you have powers.

1093
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:51,698
I'm sorry.

1094
01:21:53,218 --> 01:21:55,218
Please.

1095
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,778
Please.

1096
01:22:00,178 --> 01:22:03,773
Jacob, nothing
ever truly dies.

1097
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:07,609
The universe wastes nothing.
Everything is simply...

1098
01:22:08,098 --> 01:22:10,098
transformed.

1099
01:22:11,698 --> 01:22:13,698
Just leave me alone.

1100
01:22:55,697 --> 01:22:58,655
- It's not fair.
- No.

1101
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:00,737
No, it isn't fair.

1102
01:23:01,497 --> 01:23:03,772
He left me alone.

1103
01:23:04,057 --> 01:23:06,969
Oh, baby, you're not alone.

1104
01:23:08,137 --> 01:23:10,137
And he didn't leave you.

1105
01:23:11,137 --> 01:23:14,766
I see him in you.
All the time.

1106
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:17,332
All the time.

1107
01:23:17,337 --> 01:23:19,897
Sometimes it's hard
for me to bear.

1108
01:23:21,377 --> 01:23:23,377
You miss him, too?

1109
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:26,417
So much.

1110
01:23:30,537 --> 01:23:33,449
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1111
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:37,097
Okay.

1112
01:24:03,977 --> 01:24:06,889
It's all right.
He's here to help.

1113
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:12,897
There's another side to you.

1114
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:18,777
I feel it now.

1115
01:24:34,137 --> 01:24:36,137
Is that how it ends?

1116
01:24:38,257 --> 01:24:40,257
Yes.

1117
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:42,537
You can't stop it?

1118
01:24:43,377 --> 01:24:45,377
I don't know.

1119
01:24:49,697 --> 01:24:53,246
It would come at a price
to you and your way of life.

1120
01:24:53,337 --> 01:24:56,295
But we can change.
You know that now.

1121
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:58,932
Please.

1122
01:24:58,937 --> 01:25:01,292
Please, just give us a chance.

1123
01:25:03,977 --> 01:25:05,692
I'll try.

1124
01:25:05,697 --> 01:25:07,767
I must get back to the city.

1125
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:29,367
Of course, Mr. President.
I understand the situation.

1126
01:25:30,497 --> 01:25:32,497
But with all due respect, sir,

1127
01:25:32,537 --> 01:25:35,529
any further military action
will only make things worse.

1128
01:25:35,617 --> 01:25:39,007
I believe we may still be able
to open a dialog...

1129
01:25:44,657 --> 01:25:47,455
Yes, Mr. President.
As you wish, sir.

1130
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:49,537
Thank you.

1131
01:26:16,177 --> 01:26:17,572
Checkpoint.

1132
01:26:17,577 --> 01:26:20,011
We can't stop.
There isn't time.

1133
01:26:27,897 --> 01:26:29,897
- Dive.
- Look out.

1134
01:26:31,617 --> 01:26:33,572
Lincoln-Bravo-1 to
Lincoln-Bravo-2,

1135
01:26:33,577 --> 01:26:35,078
a black SUV crashed
our checkpoint...

1136
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:35,812
with the suspects.

1137
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:39,048
- En route to your position.
- Roger that, Bravo-1.

1138
01:26:45,257 --> 01:26:46,612
Bravo-1, we've got orders...

1139
01:26:46,617 --> 01:26:48,292
to let them through.
Do you copy?

1140
01:26:48,297 --> 01:26:50,297
Roger that.

1141
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:53,612
They're slowing down.

1142
01:26:53,617 --> 01:26:56,177
- They're letting us through.
- Why?

1143
01:27:11,617 --> 01:27:13,617
Where is everybody?

1144
01:27:14,577 --> 01:27:16,693
They've cleared the area.

1145
01:27:17,537 --> 01:27:18,692
Stop the car.

1146
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:20,697
- What?
- Stop the car.

1147
01:27:56,377 --> 01:27:58,493
Jacob. Jacob.

1148
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:00,332
I'm okay.

1149
01:28:00,337 --> 01:28:02,337
Michael?

1150
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:15,372
We have to get to the sphere.

1151
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:27,177
Helen.

1152
01:28:42,257 --> 01:28:44,257
We won't make it.

1153
01:28:58,257 --> 01:29:00,566
I can't keep them
out for long.

1154
01:29:07,137 --> 01:29:09,137
Mom.

1155
01:29:15,777 --> 01:29:18,245
What's happening to him?

1156
01:29:18,337 --> 01:29:20,337
Jacob.

1157
01:29:20,657 --> 01:29:22,657
They're inside him.

1158
01:29:24,537 --> 01:29:26,537
He's dying.

1159
01:29:27,177 --> 01:29:29,177
Help him.

1160
01:29:34,857 --> 01:29:38,008
Help him. Please.

1161
01:30:23,176 --> 01:30:25,770
Your professor was right.

1162
01:30:25,856 --> 01:30:27,856
At the precipice,

1163
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,536
we change.

1164
01:33:38,576 --> 01:33:40,576
It's leaving.

1165
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:47,691
No.

1166
01:33:47,696 --> 01:33:49,696
He's leaving.
