1
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,492
Oh, I'm so full.

2
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:56,872
You were right,
I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.

3
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:59,708
Want to split a dessert?

4
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,164
You okay? You seem a little off.

5
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,792
Yeah, I'm just trying to
think about what I want.

6
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:10,252
Yeah, me too.

7
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:13,839
Why don't we just say it at the
same time? One, two, three...

8
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,434
- I want a divorce.
- Crème brûlée.

9
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,502
You can't get away.

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,197
It's okay, that's my fault.

11
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,075
Come on, let's get you to bed
before your parents get home.

12
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,535
No puppy eyes, you little maniac.

13
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,587
Go brush your teeth.

14
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,706
Aren't you gonna say anything?

15
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,296
Almost 25 years of marriage
and you have nothing to say?

16
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,303
Robbie.

17
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,588
Hey, Robbie, have you seen
Molly's homework?

18
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,424
- Get out.
- Oh, my God.

19
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,434
Close the door.

20
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:45,981
Okay, Robbie, I'm really sorry,
and I didn't see anything.

21
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,277
Oh, my God.

22
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,190
Ok, you're not talking, and you know
that only makes me talk more.

23
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:58,277
But maybe that's good, you know?
Because maybe I'll just say it.

24
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,622
Maybe... Maybe I'll just tell you
I slept with someone.

25
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,791
David Lindhagen. From work.

26
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,586
- You met him at the Christmas party.
- Please stop.

27
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:18,088
The last person in the world
I'd wanna hurt is you.

28
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,119
If you keep talking,
I'm gonna get out of the car.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,814
I think the fact that I did it,
it just shows how broken we are.

30
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:26,847
- Okay.
- How much we really... Cal.

31
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:29,816
Oh, my God! Cal!

32
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:38,784
Are you okay?

33
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,627
I'll leave tonight.

34
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:45,448
I'll sign whatever you want.
Just please stop talking about it.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,177
Okay.

36
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,556
I'm sorry you had to see that.

37
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,942
No, you know, I should have knocked.

38
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,570
Just for the record,
I think about you while I do it.

39
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,697
- Robbie.
- I have this picture of you...

40
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,708
- and I look at it the whole time.
- Stop it.

41
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,829
I love you, Jessica.

42
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,206
I am actually begging you to stop it.

43
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,626
And I know you're 17,
and I know I just turned 13...

44
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,045
which is the same age
as your little brother.

45
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,339
But soon our age difference
won't even matter.

46
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,852
Which is good, because I'm pretty sure
you're my soul mate.

47
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,562
Okay...

48
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,223
- Listen, Robbie...
- We're home.

49
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,150
- Shit.
- Hey.

50
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,519
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Weaver, how was...?

51
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,521
Oh, my God. What happened?

52
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,649
Mrs. Weaver said she wanted a divorce,
and I jumped out of the car.

53
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,943
- Cal. Honey...
- Well...

54
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,154
- Kids good? Everybody good?
- Dad?

55
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,823
Hey, Buddy, I didn't
see you standing there.

56
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,584
- You're getting a divorce?
- Well, yes.

57
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,244
So, Jess,
did Molly get through dinner okay?

58
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,063
Yeah, yeah, she's...

59
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:17,532
- You jumped out of a moving car?
- I did. I jumped out of a moving car.

60
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,835
- Did she fight you on broccoli?
- No, she didn't.

61
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,270
She always fights me on broccoli.

62
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,207
- Sorry you had to find out this way.
- Sorry you jumped out of a car.

63
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,692
- I'm sorry if she fought you on broccoli.
- It's okay.

64
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,813
I don't have any money.

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,720
Sweetheart? Let's go to bed, okay?

66
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,523
Listen, why don't you grab your coat?
I'll drive you home. All right.

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,727
I don't care. I love him. I really do.

68
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:39,404
And, given the opportunity...

69
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,356
Yes, I would have his babies.

70
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:45,235
Seriously? Conan O'Brien?
You would do Conan O'Brien?

71
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,653
Oh, my God, yes.

72
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,789
Friend to friend.

73
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,002
I don't know. Your life is so PG-13.

74
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,539
- My life is not PG-13.
- Oh, it so is.

75
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,082
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

76
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:02,753
You've never left L.A. You pass the bar,
you're gonna be what, a patent lawyer?

77
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:07,090
Probably married to that human Valium,
Richard. I just...

78
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,392
Listen, I worry about you, is all.

79
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,610
So much potential...

80
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,739
and you've resorted to fantasizing
about Conan "Ginger Junk" O'Brien.

81
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,950
- He's funny.
- He looks like a carrot, honey.

82
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,751
Who looks like a carrot?

83
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,957
Hi. Who looks like a carrot?

84
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,167
Conan O'Brien.

85
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,420
My friend Hannah here
thinks he's sexy.

86
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:48,257
That's weird, I think that your friend
Hannah is sexy.

87
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,510
Oh, my God. You did not just say that.

88
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,803
How old are you?

89
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:55,264
- What are you, a lawyer?
- Yeah. A little bit.

90
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,890
- Come on.
- I know.

91
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,850
- You are? Is she?
- Gonna be.

92
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,645
Don't you think you're a little old
to use cheesy pickup lines?

93
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:04,690
Objection. Leading the witness.

94
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,150
You're wearing that
like you're doing it a favor.

95
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,944
- Oh, God.
- That's a line.

96
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:13,198
Me sitting there for the past two hours not
being able to take my eyes off you is fact.

97
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,168
I mean, there's lots of beautiful women
in this bar. Your friend included. Hi.

98
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,545
I love you.

99
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,541
But I can't take my eyes off of you.
That's a fact, it's not a line.

100
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,718
I find you very attractive.

101
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,295
Do you find me attractive?

102
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,630
- She does.
- I don't.

103
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,590
- You do. She does.
- Yes, she does.

104
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,134
- I don't.
- You do.

105
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,927
- You do.
- I don't.

106
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,846
- Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
- No.

107
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,556
- You say no a lot, don't you?
- No.

108
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,058
Oh, boy. Permission
to approach the bench?

109
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,268
Seriously?

110
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,738
Just, come on, let me deliver
my closing argument.

111
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,690
Sure. Proceed.

112
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,068
Hannah, we live in a
physical world, right?

113
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,071
And you're going to age, right?

114
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,323
I guarantee you this:

115
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,160
You're never gonna regret going home with
that guy from the bar that one time...

116
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,295
that was a total tomcat in the sack.

117
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,206
But I can't guarantee
that you won't not regret it.

118
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:06,593
- That was a double negative.
- You're a double negative.

119
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,755
Okay. Hannah, can I buy you a drink?

120
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,758
Okay. You know what?
It's time to go home.

121
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:13,967
Really?

122
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,136
That's forward of you, but okay.
I'll do it.

123
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,971
I TIVoed <i>Saw III</i>.

124
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,058
So should I get my car or yours?
Should I pull the car around?

125
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,559
You been drinking? I'll drive.

126
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,528
- Liz?
- Coming.

127
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,391
I'll have to call Nanna.

128
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,943
Noth...

129
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,284
So Stanford, huh?

130
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,906
Good for you. That's great.
I know your dad's really proud.

131
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,583
Yeah. Yeah, he's...

132
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,672
- Are you sure you're okay?
- David Lindhagen, God.

133
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:34,472
Okay.

134
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,816
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

135
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,235
It's okay.

136
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,858
Mr. Weaver?

137
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:00,582
You're the nicest dad that I babysit...

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,834
Of all the,

139
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,544
You're really nice.

140
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,088
- That's very nice.
- And,

141
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,210
I like Ms. Weaver,
I like her a lot. Okay?

142
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,339
But if she wants to divorce you...

143
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,467
then I think she's batshit crazy.

144
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,646
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

145
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,559
I hope this doesn't make you
uncomfortable.

146
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,729
- I've developed, like, a little crush...
- Could you do me a favor?

147
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,401
Would you not mention to your parents
that Mrs. Weaver and I are, you know...

148
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,704
It's something we wanna tell them
on our own, okay?

149
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,706
Yeah.

150
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,409
Thank you, I appreciate that.

151
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,835
Have a good night.

152
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,183
See you soon

153
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,982
Another vodka cranberry?

154
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,267
I'm sorry. What?

155
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,270
- Another vodka cranberry?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, thanks.

156
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,232
It's no surprise

157
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,568
I've been by this place
a million times, never come in.

158
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,403
It's nice, lot of pretty girls.

159
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,822
Nowhere

160
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,874
This is my life

161
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:30,080
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

162
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:34,092
My wife is having intercourse
with someone who is not me.

163
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:36,962
Um, I'm sorry to hear that.

164
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:42,433
Thank you. That is very nice
of you to say. Very, very nice.

165
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,897
She just told me. I just found
out, so I'm a little raw. It's...

166
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,191
Okay. Well, you're not listening.

167
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,195
Okay.

168
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:58,908
You wouldn't ignore me
if I were David Lindhagen.

169
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,321
My wife doesn't ignore David Lindhagen.

170
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,582
She screws him.

171
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,793
Screws him.

172
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,714
They make this, like, gurgling sound,
it's like:

173
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,086
Gay.

174
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,468
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey.

175
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,395
Hey.

176
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:32,025
Oh, I just, I got the report
on the end-of-year financials.

177
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,061
- Good. Good, good. Really great.
- Oh, good.

178
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,980
You killed this quarter.

179
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,356
Okay.

180
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,241
- Cal, seriously.
- All right.

181
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,278
- Okay.
- Seriously.

182
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,873
Who told you
that Emily and I are getting divorced?

183
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,918
- You're getting a divorce?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:56,458
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.
We all thought it was cancer.

185
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,835
Thank God, man.

186
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,470
Yeah, just my relationship.

187
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,183
Thank God.

188
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,968
Divorce.

189
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,221
- I'm so lucky.
- You are.

190
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:14,609
- I have to go pick out furniture now.
- Okay, okay. You go for it.

191
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,489
It could have been cancer, buddy.

192
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,941
Hey, everyone, it's just a divorce.

193
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,401
All right, buddy.

194
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,162
Thanks. Feels good.

195
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,840
Cal? I just wanted to say...

196
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,642
Shit.

197
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,265
Can I back that thing
out of the driveway for you?

198
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:57,360
- Oh, no. I'll be fine.
- You have trouble in reverse, is all.

199
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:02,198
When I get settled, the kids can come
and take a look at my new place.

200
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,946
I think I'm having a midlife crisis,
maybe.

201
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,915
Can women have midlife crises?

202
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,078
In the movies it's always men having them
and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches...

203
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,788
but, you know, I'm not a man.

204
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,331
Be sure to fertilize all this.

205
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:23,294
We got married so young, Cal.
And now I'm 44.

206
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,014
And it's so much older
than I thought I'd be.

207
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,675
There's a turnoff valve
for the sprinklers over there.

208
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,344
Last week, when I told you
that I had to work late...

209
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,188
I went to see the new Twilight movie
by myself.

210
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,475
I don't know why I did that.

211
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,477
And it was so bad, Cal.

212
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,772
It keeps raining, you might
wanna turn off the automatic setting.

213
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:46,568
And we haven't been us.
Not for a long time.

214
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,863
And I don't know when you and I
stopped being us.

215
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:51,789
I mean, do you?

216
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,751
Maybe it's when
you screwed David Lindhagen.

217
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:23,321
Nobody wants to be alone

218
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:31,788
The heart beats happy
when it has a place

219
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,003
And if it doesn't have a home

220
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,178
It can come into my space

221
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:52,050
So you can be the one I love

222
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,845
I can be the one you long for

223
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,024
You can be the one I want

224
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,393
Hey.

225
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,774
Sorry I'm late,
I had to pick something up at Macy's.

226
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:07,065
- Don't even worry about it.
- A chardonnay.

227
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,741
I'm just glad you're here.

228
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:11,786


229
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:16,249
I don't know. I don't know what
happened. Tough couple of days.

230
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,329
You know
when you don't see something coming...

231
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,082
Claire said I can't be friends
with you anymore.

232
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,583
What?

233
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,419
She said we had to choose
between you and Emily.

234
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,005
I chose you.

235
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,391
But she said no.

236
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,355
It's cologne.

237
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,192
Bernie?

238
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:48,156
- Are you breaking up with me, Bernie?
- There's a gift receipt in there also.

239
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,024
Bernie?

240
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,861
Bernie. Bernie.

241
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:56,781
I can be the one you long for

242
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,958
You can be the one

243
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:04,497
You know a word
that is not used very often anymore?

244
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:06,165
"Cuckold."

245
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:07,959
I'm a cuckold.

246
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,255
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.

247
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:14,799
He slept with my wife.

248
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,384
And I didn't know about it.

249
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,179
And that is the
definition of cuckoldom.

250
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,108
David Lindhagen took my wife
and slept with her.

251
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:30,023
Thought I did everything right.
Got married, had kids, the house.

252
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:33,284
What do I get for it? I get cuckolded.

253
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,788
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.

254
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,750
Welcome to my spaceship

255
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,671
It's beautiful forever

256
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,466
Can you give me five minutes?

257
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:53,171
The heart's a lonely hunter

258
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,847
Interesting.

259
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,848
Hey. Jacob Palmer.

260
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,225
- Cal Weaver.
- Let me buy you a drink, Cal.

261
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:09,403
- Thanks, I have a drink.
- Sit. I'd like to buy you a drink.

262
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:11,405
Okay.

263
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,192
Guess what.

264
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,036
- My wife is having an affair with...
- David Lindhagen.

265
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,239
David Lindhagen. I know.

266
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,200
- How do I know that?
- I don't know.

267
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,286
I'm a total stranger. How would I know
something so intimate?

268
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,797
- Lindhagen screwing with your wife too?
- No.

269
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,592
You wanna know why I know that?

270
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,003
Okay.

271
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,966
It's all that I've heard, Cal, for the
past two nights. It's all anybody's heard.

272
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:42,720
You're going around and you're badgering
people with this sad-sack loser sob story.

273
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,264
- I don't understand why.
- I don't need this crap.

274
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,358
- Cal, sit down.
- All right.

275
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:51,896
Look, I know that it sounds harsh,
but it's true.

276
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,983
And you need to hear the truth. Okay?

277
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,192
Okay.

278
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,153
Cal, would you take that straw
out of your mouth? Please.

279
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,781
That looks like
you're sucking on a tiny schwantz.

280
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:05,076
Is that what you want?
Is that the message you wanna send?

281
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,254
- No one's thinking that.
- Really?

282
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:12,917
- So permission to speak candidly, sir.
- Think you've already gone there.

283
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,253
You're sitting there
with a Supercuts haircut...

284
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,048
getting drunk on watered-down vodka
cranberries like a 14-year-old girl...

285
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,260
and you're wearing a 44 when you
should be wearing a 42 regular.

286
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,604
Honestly, I don't know if I should
help you or euthanize you.

287
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,976
Cal, you got a kind face.

288
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:33,070
You got a good head of hair.
You seem like a nice guy.

289
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,992
I wanna help you. I'm gonna help you
rediscover your manhood.

290
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:43,456
Do you have any idea,
like, where you lost it?

291
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,959
- A strong case could be made for 1984.
- Well.

292
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:51,756
We're gonna find it.

293
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:55,593
We are. I promise you.

294
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,296
And I promise you this too, Cal:

295
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,339
When we're done...

296
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,850
this wife of yours...

297
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:07,188
she's gonna rue the day
she ever decided to give up on you.

298
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:10,941
That's my offer.

299
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,402
You in or you out?

300
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,064
Why are you doing this?

301
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,948
Maybe you remind me of someone.

302
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,952
You in or you out?

303
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,290
I'm in.

304
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,255
Hey, fancy face, you wanna go?

305
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,334
Okay.

306
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,179
Century City Mall, food court,
3:00, Thursday.

307
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:43,808
After you, hon.

308
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,604
Good night, fancy face.

309
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,486
She will rue the day.

310
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,865
Set you guys up with some snacks
over here. TV's already on.

311
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:06,789
You okay?

312
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,208
Yeah. You?

313
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,670
Can I tell you something?

314
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,506
Love sucks.

315
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,337
Yeah.

316
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,256
You in love, buddy?

317
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,883
- Well, if you must know...
- Ding-dong.

318
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,427
- Oh, hey, Jess. Thanks for coming by.
- Hey. Yeah.

319
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:29,971
What is she doing here?

320
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:34,559
Guys, I have to step out for a couple
of minutes. Okay? All right? Okay.

321
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,894
Mom wants you to stay
while she's out hooking.

322
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,312
- What?
- What?

323
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,858
Um, the place is nice, Mr. Weaver.

324
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,901
Thanks.
That's a very generous adjective.

325
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,778
- Honey.
- I don't need a babysitter.

326
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,322
She's only four years older.
You need to know that.

327
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,409
- She needs to know that.
- I know, I know, I know.

328
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,286
Man, are you growing up.

329
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:55,955
Look at him. It's unbelievable.
He's in love already.

330
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,419
Molly. Say bye to Daddy.

331
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,222
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm taking a class.

332
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,010
- That is great, Mr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

333
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:13,264
This is a difficult time for you, right?
And it's important to try new things.

334
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,268
Even things that you haven't
considered trying before.

335
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,898
Yup. Molly, I'm going.

336
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,859
Okay. That's my princess. Bye. Thanks.

337
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,245
- But wait. Dad.
- Bye, guys. See you in a bit.

338
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,124
Hey, Tiger.

339
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:38,623
- I love you so, so much.
- Jeez, Robbie.

340
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,799
I love you so much. Please?

341
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:46,055
What the hell am I doing?

342
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,058
What am I doing?

343
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,054
Hey, everybody.

344
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,389
Everybody. If I could...

345
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,642
Thank you. A little toast.

346
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,820
I would like to thank you all for coming
to Hannah Banana's goodbye party.

347
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,357
And to my...

348
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,442
Hannah Banana.

349
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:09,278
You go into your cave
and you study your butt off.

350
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:14,792
Because if you do, I just know that
you are gonna kick that bar's butt...

351
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:18,496
- out of here. You know?
- Yeah.

352
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,249
It reminds me of an old story
my law professor told me...

353
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,626
Oh, dear God. Cheers, everyone.

354
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,878
Cheers.

355
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,088
Hey, Liz.

356
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:31,600
Listen, when my girl here passes...

357
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:35,263
I'm gonna have another
little celebration right here...

358
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,641
and I hope you can make it,
because it's gonna be a special night.

359
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,484
Okay.

360
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,692
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

361
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:52,162
- You heard that? "Special night"?
- Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:54,707
You think he's gonna propose?

363
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:58,869
At the El Torito Grill?
God, I hope not.

364
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,296
Why, do you want him to?

365
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,708
I don't know, he's nice.

366
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,760
"He's Ni..."? Hannah.

367
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:08,754
He's a sweetheart. Look at him.

368
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,347
- He bcc'd you?
- Right, yeah.

369
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,927
All right. Hannah, look at you.
Look at you.

370
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:18,222
If you end up with that,
what am I gonna end up with?

371
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,559
- Shut up. Come on.
- That shit's depressing.

372
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,730
All right. You know what? I have to
not big-sister you. It's fine if...

373
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,939
Jesus, really?

374
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,942
No. No. Not my life. Not my life.
I'm going. Okay?

375
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,571
So call me if you need anything. Bye.

376
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,197
You're awful. Bye.

377
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:37,541
Thank you for coming.

378
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,320
- You're late.
- Yeah. Sorry.

379
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:16,238
- Sbarro's?
- No, thanks.

380
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,949
Let me ask a question.
How much you got for clothes?

381
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,745
- What happened to your feet?
- What do you mean?

382
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,748
- These are my 407s.
- Oh, they're 407s.

383
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:27,416
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.

384
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,585
- These offer a lot of support.
- Right.

385
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,387
Come on.

386
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,131
- What, are you in a fraternity?
- Are you insane?

387
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,258
You could have hit somebody.
What was that?

388
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,594
- I'm asking a question. You in a frat?
- No.

389
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:40,304
- Are you Steve Jobs?
- What?

390
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,516
Hold on a second. Are you the
billionaire owner of Apple Computers?

391
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:44,809
No.

392
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,654
Okay. Well, in that case, you got no
right to wear New Balance sneakers ever.

393
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,507
Come on.

394
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,029
Okay. All right.

395
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,657
One of the best parts
about being a guy your age...

396
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,918
Frankly, there aren't many, so you
should really take full advantage of it.

397
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,164
Is that you can rebuild your entire
wardrobe with like 16 items.

398
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,590
Credit card.

399
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:21,437
What?

400
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,270
You see, the problem
is that your head has like...

401
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,655
Like the proportions
of a Styrofoam peanut.

402
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:39,371
The skin under your eyes is starting
to look like Hugh Hefner's ball sac.

403
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,710
It does.

404
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,468
Where are your wallets?

405
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:57,923
- I'm set for jeans.
- You're not set for jeans.

406
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,384
- These are fine.
- They're not fine.

407
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,228
- You have a mom butt.
- Why don't we just go to the Gap?

408
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:07,766
- You know what? They have a s...
- Okay.

409
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,110
What are you doing?

410
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:17,534
Cal, be better than the Gap.

411
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,987
Be better than the Gap.

412
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,830
Say it.

413
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm better than the Gap.

414
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,704
- Come on.
- God.

415
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:31,048
- Stop slapping me. Really.
- Okay.

416
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,217
You're beautiful.

417
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,462
He likes to slap me in the face.

418
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:38,589
- What are you doing later?
- I don't know.

419
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,299
- I do.
- Do you?

420
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,301
- I know exactly what you're doing.

421
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:43,719
Seriously? Seriously?

422
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,429
- You ask her out like that?
- Yeah.

423
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,815
And that worked?

424
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,683
Yeah.

425
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,653
Feeling kind of stupid, but...

426
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:57,608
Look at you.

427
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,201
Feel like I'm going skiing.

428
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,738
- Would you sleep with him?
- Jesus. God.

429
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,874
- Yeah, probably.
- Wha...?

430
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,118
You would?

431
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,255
That's... What?

432
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,092
What are you even saying?

433
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,127
You see what just happened, Cal?

434
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:20,923
Soon as you opened your mouth, Tiffany
started doubting whether she wanted to.

435
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:24,051
That's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

436
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,936
No. This is.

437
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,309
Your wife cheated on you because you
lost sight of who you are as a man...

438
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,021
as a husband, and probably as a lover.

439
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,448
You're right, that's meaner.

440
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,786
Let's talk about how many women
you've been with.

441
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:46,665
- Sexually?
- Yeah, no. I mean break-dance fighting.

442
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,127
One.

443
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,547
No. Not at one time.

444
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,009
How many total?

445
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,337
Don't say it. Don't say it.

446
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,131
We met in high school, okay?

447
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:04,558
Oh, boy. You're kidding me.

448
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,969
One woman? That's great.

449
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,846
- Emily is beautiful.
- I guess.

450
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,181
She was gorgeous.
She was one of those women...

451
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:15,102
that could be wildly sexy and
unbelievably cute all at the same time.

452
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:16,895
We had a little blip senior year...

453
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:19,481
I literally stopped
listening at "Emily."

454
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,900
I think we should start approaching
women tonight.

455
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,994
Are you ready to go?

456
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:26,872
I miss my wife.

457
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:31,827
- Hi.
- Hi.

458
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,662
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

459
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:35,748
I'm great. I'm Jacob. What's your name?

460
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,467
- Amy Johnson.
- Amy Johnson.

461
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:41,712
- I'm Jacob Palmer. How you doing?
- Great.

462
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,255
- Good.
- I'm Cal.

463
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:44,882
No. Not yet.

464
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,385
Sorry. Amy, can I buy you a drink?

465
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,637
Keep her company?

466
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,397
- I'd be happy to.
- If he gets handsy, let me know.

467
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,443
I wouldn't touch you
if my life depended on it.

468
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,484
- What was your name?
- Cal Weaver.

469
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:06,161
- Cal Weaver.
- No relation to Dennis Weaver.

470
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:09,448
McCloud.

471
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,242
McCloud was a show in the '70s
that...

472
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,662
You're not talking about McCloud
again, are you?

473
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:18,082
Here we go, huh?
To all of our fallen homeys.

474
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,751
Well, I'm the fourth of five sisters.

475
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,003
- No. That's boring.

476
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,757
Not for your sisters, but for my
purposes, it's not gonna work.

477
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,885
- Okay.
- I have this friend.

478
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:34,348
And he thinks that you're way too pretty
to be interesting and that's hogwash.

479
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:37,768
- All right. You wanna get out of here?
- Sure.

480
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,061
Giddyup.

481
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,522
Am I boring you? I'm
totally boring you. I'm...

482
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,148
How are you doing this, like...

483
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:46,944
wildly sexy but unbelievably cute
thing that you're doing?

484
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,904
It's weird.

485
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,115
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah.

486
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,409
- Okay.
- Cool.

487
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,787
So Molly, who's 6 at the time,
can't find Mr. Bobo.

488
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,706
We're looking all over.

489
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:02,676
It's in the kitchen. Mr. Bobo was
in the kitchen the whole time.

490
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,629
Wanna get out of here?

491
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,639
Have a good night.

492
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,384
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

493
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,969
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

494
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,138
- Let's get out of here.
- Absolutely.

495
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,399
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

496
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:07,741
Shit.

497
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,448
- You have a second?
- Hey, David. No. Because I'm swamped.

498
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,159
- You've been avoiding me.
- No. I haven't.

499
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,913
You ran in the other direction when you
saw me coming down the hall yesterday.

500
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:23,791
- You're very fast, by the way.
- I ran track in high school.

501
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,051
That must be it.

502
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,088
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about you and Cal.

503
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:32,216
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

504
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,884
I like you, Emily.

505
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,094
Do you have any idea
how much I like you?

506
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,472
Hey, David, you know,
I really have a lot to do.

507
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:41,058
I had no intention of falling
for a married woman...

508
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,353
but all of a sudden we're having
lunch and I'm this accountant...

509
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:47,064
who's waking up every morning
excited to go to work.

510
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,859
And that just does not happen
for accountants. Ever.

511
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,820
I checked with other accountants.

512
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,239
David, you know what?
You've been a great friend.

513
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,575
You noticed last month when I got
my hair trimmed and that was huge.

514
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,202
But look, trust me. You know...

515
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:03,956
I am saving you from disaster, because
you're asking to pre-board the Titanic.

516
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,999
Do you really want any part of this?

517
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,759
Do I really want any part of this?

518
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:11,471
- Emily? Your report's ready.
- Okay.

519
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,301
Okay, people. Here it is.

520
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:20,264
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

521
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:25,360
A romance set in Salem in the 1600s.
It is about sin.

522
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:45,789
Forced to wear the scarlet A
to punish her adulterous behavior.

523
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,460
Dimmesdale's A is inflicted upon
himself in the form of a...

524
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:54,548
Mr. Weaver.

525
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:57,467
Are we interrupting?

526
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:01,096
You wanna talk about
The Scarlet Letter, Ms. Tafferty?

527
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:02,514
All right.

528
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:07,144
Well, the A they're both wearing...

529
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,188
I think it stands for "asshole."

530
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,607
Wanna know why?

531
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,942
Because they fell in love...

532
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:16,945
and love is for stupid assholes.

533
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:19,698
And this book is just about
a bunch of assholes...

534
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,825
who fell in love, like assholes...

535
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,836
then had to die, like assholes.

536
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:29,341
I'm sorry about all the "assholes."

537
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,668
You know what else might work?
A swear jar.

538
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,338
You know, a quarter per curse word.

539
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,173
Yeah, we'll definitely try that.

540
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,966
All right. Could help.

541
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,393
- Take care.
- Thanks.

542
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:46,767
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

543
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:50,520
Hey, I have to go back to the office.
You're gonna have to wait for me there.

544
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,155
Fine.

545
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,993
They're still making kids read
The Scarlet Letter, huh?

546
00:34:57,453 --> 00:34:58,528
Yep.

547
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:02,499
You'd think somebody would have
written something better by now.

548
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,350
I guess I should take that down, huh?

549
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,143
I guess.

550
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:31,319
So how is he? You know.

551
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,691
I mean, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Forget it. Just ignore me.

552
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:37,450
- Forget I ever...
- He's out a lot.

553
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,904
- A lot?
- Yeah.

554
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,706
Like...

555
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:47,168
Like "a lot" a lot,
or just like a little?

556
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:48,878
A lot.

557
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,550
Well, that's good. That's really good.

558
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:01,308
- Wanna get takeout tonight, honey?
- I mean, he's sad.

559
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,512
I can tell that he's sad.
Even though he looks better...

560
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:11,776
I can still tell that he's not happy,
you know?

561
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:17,282
Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah.

562
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,030
I guess I'm pretty sad too.

563
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,823
I know.

564
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:27,167
I heard you crying the other night.

565
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,911
Didn't know what to do.

566
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:34,875
Oh, Robbie, baby, you're 13,
you're not supposed to know what to do.

567
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,084
I tried Googling it.

568
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:38,587
- You did not.
- Yep. I did.

569
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:42,390
- Well, what did you Google?
- I searched "Mom crying in bed."

570
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,093
What did Google say?

571
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:50,307
Just a bunch of weird videos
of moms in bed.

572
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,984
Oh, God. Okay.
All right, that's enough. No more.

573
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,446
Do those parental controls work at all?

574
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,073
They work for me.

575
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,369
Because you're a disgusting teenager,
that's why.

576
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,654
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

577
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:08,700
- Bill wants to see you before you take off.
- David, this is my son, Robbie.

578
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,286
Robbie, this is David.

579
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:15,131
- Um, we work together.
- How you doing, buddy?

580
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,004
- You all right to wait a little bit?
- Yeah.

581
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,015
Okay. Thanks, David.

582
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:40,949
So, Robbie, I hear
you're quite the soccer player.

583
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:48,331
So, David, I hear
you broke up my parents' marriage.

584
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,869
- You are David Lindhagen, right?
- Lindhagen.

585
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,206
- Yeah. Here's the thing, Lindhagen.
- Hagen.

586
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,415
Whatever.

587
00:37:57,716 --> 00:38:00,377
In the end, she winds up
back with my dad.

588
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,713
He's a better guy than you are
in every category.

589
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:06,800
And she still loves him.
He's not gonna give up on my mom...

590
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,427
like I'm not gonna stop
sending Jessica messages...

591
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,513
that make her feel uncomfortable.

592
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:13,682
Hey. You ready to go, honey?

593
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:17,610
- Can we order Chinese for dinner tonight?
- Yeah. Sure, honey.

594
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:20,147
Hi, David. Get your stuff.

595
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,115
- Bye, David.
- See you.

596
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,576
You're not gonna be able
to feel your arms.

597
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,419
I'll be fine.

598
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,121
Jesus Christ.

599
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,707
Look, let's face it, Cal, all right?

600
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:43,386
The war between the sexes is over,
and we won, okay?

601
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,716
We won the second women started doing
pole dancing for exercise.

602
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:50,427
But even though we won,
they still deserve our respect.

603
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,222
Make them feel beautiful, listen to
their problems, open the door for them.

604
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:56,183
Would you put on some clothes, please?

605
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,643
- I'm sorry, is this bothering you?
- No, it's not.

606
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:02,363
My schwantz is in your face. If it's
not bothering you, we got a problem.

607
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,983
- Okay, it bothers me.
- I don't care.

608
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:08,111
You gotta take control
of your manhood, pal. You know?

609
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,071
You want something, you take it.

610
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:12,949
You don't like something, you say it.
I take what I want.

611
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,785
David Lindhagen certainly took
what he wanted, didn't he?

612
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,412
And I can guarantee you this:

613
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:21,249
He is opening the car door
for your wife right now.

614
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,592
What, you passing out?

615
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,554
Oh, boy.

616
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,727
- I think you're ready, pal.
- For what?

617
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:45,023
To talk to a pretty lady, and take
her home and show her your gift.

618
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:46,733
No. No, I'm not.

619
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,652
You're ready as you're ever gonna be.

620
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,821
You play your strengths, pal.
That's all any of us can do.

621
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,624
I'm mysterious.

622
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,543
I'm, you know, good in bed.

623
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,664
And you are a...

624
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,749
you know, stable and employed adult.

625
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,334
Jesus.

626
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,970
You see this lady over
here at 9 o'clock?

627
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:10,173
You want me to hit on her?

628
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,300
No, I wanna hit on her.
The one behind her.

629
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,095
She's a fox, right?

630
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:18,932
You think she came to a crowded bar to
have a quiet drink alone? She's hunting.

631
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:24,229
She's just looking for an opportunity to
settle for a responsible and stable adult.

632
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,022
And I'd like her to settle for you.

633
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,650
Well, thank you for the ego boost,
but you know what?

634
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,751
Just because I've watched you
pick up women...

635
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,570
doesn't mean I know how
to pick up women.

636
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,657
- Ever see Karate Kid?
- What does that have to do with anything?

637
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,576
When he's teaching him to wax
on and off but really to fight?

638
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,037
You want me to fight someone?

639
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,098
What's the first thing I do when I
go up to a girl? I buy her a drink.

640
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,376
Yes, always. Without fail.
You buy her a drink.

641
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,254
Even if she doesn't want one,
you insist.

642
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,339
- And do I talk about myself?
- Never.

643
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,049
Never about yourself, always her.

644
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,051
- Because bar banter?
- Is boring.

645
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,263
So you put the impetus on her.
She has to be the interesting one.

646
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,099
"Impress me. Impress me with
how interesting you are."

647
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,311
It's a big game. Game.
Creepy, creepy little game you play.

648
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:06,062
That's judgmental, isn't it?

649
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,363
At the end of the night
do I ask them to come home?

650
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:11,651
No, you tell them to come home.
They have no choice in the matter.

651
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:16,289
It is your choice and they are so
overjoyed to have had the opportunity...

652
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,627
to make sweet, sweet love to you.

653
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,629
Oh, my God.

654
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,131
You did, you Miyagi'd me.

655
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,833
Honk.

656
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:28,843
Take your ring off. Let's go.

657
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,470
Just no talking about your kids, your
job, David Lindhagen, don't you dare.

658
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,180
Shut up, shut up. Just shut up.

659
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,389
- Hello.
- Hi.

660
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,766
Hi. Hi.

661
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,101
- Who are you?
- Hey. I'm Kate.

662
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,237
- Kate, you mind if I introduce you to my...?
- I'm Cal.

663
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,482
- I got this. Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

664
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,284
And this is my friend Jacob.
He was just leaving.

665
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,247
So that's one way to treat people.

666
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,660
So can I buy you a drink, Kate?

667
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,257
- No, thank you.
- I'm gonna buy you a drink anyway.

668
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,379
Grey Goose, right?

669
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,139
Rocks. Two limes?

670
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:16,683
I'm five years sober.

671
00:42:17,726 --> 00:42:19,928
- What can I get for you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

672
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,647
Go away, we're good.
Please don't come back ever.

673
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:29,529
- So, what do you do, Cal?
- I don't know. What do you do, Kate?

674
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,948
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.

675
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:37,662
Seriously, what do you do?

676
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,170
Are you really not going to tell me
what you do?

677
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,423
- Okay, I'm a teacher.
- Boring.

678
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,252
Come on, you gotta keep it interesting.
Interest me.

679
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:56,798
- I studied at Oxford for five years.
- Boring!

680
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:01,010
 Teacher with an alcohol dependency
who studied at Oxford.

681
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,098
England. Yuck.

682
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:06,891
I think my friends just got here.

683
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:09,602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

684
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,439
- Okay, I'm in corporate insurance.
- Oh, God.

685
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,982
I have children, plural.

686
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,284
My wife was cheating on me
with Lindhagen...

687
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:19,446
which I wasn't supposed to tell you.
Nice to meet you.

688
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:22,532
- What were you supposed to tell me?
- I don't know. I don't know.

689
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,703
I was supposed to say that you are the
perfect combination of sexy and cute...

690
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,831
which is actually something
that I used to say to my wife.

691
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:32,167
But now it's become corrupted.

692
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:35,295
And I have 18 layers of clothes on.

693
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,715
I'm wearing a shirt and a tie
and a sweater and a suede jacket...

694
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,050
that just seals in all the heat.

695
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,802
Seals in all the juices.

696
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:47,682
It's all sweat under here.
This is just sweat from here down.

697
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:52,520
This sweater, this is called slim cut,
but it feels like a scuba suit.

698
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:55,198
And I'm looking at your breasts.
What's that about?

699
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,985
You think I'm the perfect combination
of sexy and cute?

700
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:01,404
That's what you picked up
from what I just said?

701
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,288
- So this is my crappy apartment.

702
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:13,750
Dumpy. That I had to move into
after my wife left me.

703
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,585
I love how you're being so honest.

704
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,221
- You like that?
- It's so different. It's so hot.

705
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,423
Okay. Okay.

706
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:23,760
- More.
- Okay.

707
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,637
Wanna hear something really hot?

708
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:28,848
I've only had sex with one woman.
In my entire life.

709
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:30,709
- Honest or not honest?
- That's honest.

710
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,479
More! Tell me more.

711
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,864
I'm a little worried you have AIDS.

712
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,945
Just a little. Just a little bit.

713
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,956
It's okay, I'm not worried.

714
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,710
Oh, my God, this is so much fun.

715
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,089
What do you wanna do with me?

716
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,094
I wanna show you off to my ex-wife
and make her really jealous.

717
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,007
Man.

718
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,223
You gonna call me?

719
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:11,432
Okay.

720
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:12,775
Yeah.

721
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,492
Wow, that is a great dress.
Where'd you get that?

722
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,786
Thank you. A store in Beverly Hills.

723
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:33,371
Really? Beautiful.

724
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:35,164
It was a gift from my grandmother.

725
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:36,625
- Really?
- It's a Krugerrand.

726
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:37,959
It's from South Africa.

727
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,802
I love it.

728
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,310
And I told him never to assume
anything.

729
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:52,056
And I've been to Maine, so that's a sixth
state. So I've been to six states.

730
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:54,684
- Oh, I love Maine.
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

731
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,153
- Have you been to Waterville?
- I have, yeah.

732
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,485
Greece, Italy.

733
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:05,862
Greece, Italy?

734
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,196
Wanna get out of here?

735
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:08,915
- You're driving.
- I am.

736
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,803
I have never experienced that
in my life.

737
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:26,007
- Pretty great.
- Are most women like that these days?

738
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:28,509
- God bless technology.
- God bless it.

739
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,722
I went and met this girl the other night.
She was heckling me the whole time we...

740
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,142
I felt like I was doing it with the two
old guys from The Muppet Show.

741
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:38,811
- Statler and Waldorf.
- I was into it.

742
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:42,774
And she was like, "Look at this frown
on your face. What is that?

743
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:46,194
You're so serious. What, it's serious
to kiss me? It's supposed to be fun.

744
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:49,055
Oh, my God, if it's gonna be hard work,
why don't you just stop?"

745
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:56,037
Hello?

746
00:46:56,338 --> 00:46:58,665
Hey. Hot guy from the bar
who hit on you is here.

747
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,249
Liz, I'm studying.

748
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,544
You should be studying the ceiling
of his bedroom.

749
00:47:03,845 --> 00:47:05,171
I am eating a caramel apple.

750
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:08,132
In what world, honey?
Please, turn around. No.

751
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:11,177
Come on, take a break.
It'll be good for you to get out.

752
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,387
And by get out...

753
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:16,565
I mean have hot guy from the bar knock you
into his headboard until you see God.

754
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,059
What is wrong with you?

755
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,000
You should be studying the curve
of his...

756
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,312
Okay, goodbye, Liz.

757
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:23,739
That too much? Hello?

758
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,443
Look, I gave him the cologne
like you told me to...

759
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,530
and I don't think we should really
just dance on his grave.

760
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:34,667
I just thought you'd wanna know
what I heard about your old pal Cal.

761
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:37,370
What about Mr. Weaver, Mom?

762
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:43,418
Um, just, apparently, Mr. Weaver
has become a real ladies' man.

763
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,086
- What?
- Claire.

764
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:48,005
She should know. She babysits for him.

765
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:52,051
She's almost an adult. Lots of young
women in and out of his apartment.

766
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:53,469
She's too young for this.

767
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,097
I don't like this S-E-X talk in front
of the K-I-D-S.

768
00:47:56,398 --> 00:47:59,392
First of all, they can spell.
Second of all, I'm just saying.

769
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,569
I think we were right
in choosing Emily.

770
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:23,850
Why are you following me?

771
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:26,502
Madison, I just had a question for you.

772
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,337
Okay, Jessica, what's up?

773
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,131
It's kind of on the personal side.

774
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:31,474
Yep, my lips are:

775
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:38,189
Seals. My lips are seals.

776
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,351
Okay.

777
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:46,689
My question, and I don't mean to be blunt or
insulting, but let's just call it what it is.

778
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,983
You're always sleeping
with older guys, right?

779
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:50,877
 Always.

780
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:55,782
So my question for you, Madison,
is... how do you do that?

781
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,702
I mean, how do you get them to see you as
not just a kid in high school, you know?

782
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,371
But as someone that's mature,
and old, and that's...

783
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:05,291
Well, first off, I have a huge rack.

784
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:06,793
Yes, you do.

785
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:08,636
You don't have a huge rack.

786
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,338
No.

787
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:12,973
- Wait, how old is he?
- Old.

788
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:15,309
Like really old?

789
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,347
- Like parent-old.
- Nasty, Jessica.

790
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:21,724
Yeah, because
that's what I was thinking, right?

791
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,351
- Rock on.
- Thank you.

792
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:26,646
- You are so dirty.
- Yes, I know.

793
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:28,731
Oh, okay. You gotta force his hand.

794
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,107
You know what I mean?

795
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:31,909
Go TMZ on his ass.

796
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:35,154
- Not following.
- A dirty picture.

797
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:38,040
Make this face:

798
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,036
- Jeez, Madison. Stop.
- What?

799
00:49:42,337 --> 00:49:47,758
You put that on his radar and he won't see you
as a little girl anymore, that's for sure.

800
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:06,652
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey. We don't know.

801
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:20,366
Behold.

802
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:23,160
Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate.

803
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:25,162
The love of my life.

804
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:28,749
I have marked myself with a scarlet J
for you, Jessica.

805
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,167
Get down from there.

806
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:34,964
- Nathaniel Hawthorne... Are you mad?
- I am your babysitter. You get down.

807
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,932
Oh, my God.

808
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:39,427
- What are you thinking?
- Like the scaffold?

809
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:42,096
Took me like four weeks to make it.
It has wheels.

810
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:44,056
This has got to stop, Robbie.

811
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:46,976
- You'll learn to love me, I promise.
- No, I won't.

812
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,362
- Because I'm four years younger?
- Because I love somebody else.

813
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:53,399
Who is he?

814
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,950
He's older.

815
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,370
And I didn't want my
parents to find out.

816
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:02,158
You know I'll kill him if he hurts you.

817
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,418
Yeah, I know.

818
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,254
Okay, Robbie, this has to stop.

819
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:09,590
Okay? No more.

820
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:12,335
Grow up.

821
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:13,802
I'll see you around.

822
00:52:12,988 --> 00:52:14,029
Okay.

823
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:01,485
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow
at my parent-teacher thing.

824
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:03,537
Yeah, no biggie.

825
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,919
What's with all the moping?

826
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,423
Nothing. It's just...

827
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,009
There's a girl.

828
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:20,588
A girl, huh?

829
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:22,014
You like her?

830
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,217
I like Pringles.

831
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:27,227
I mean, this girl...

832
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,096
she's incredible.

833
00:53:29,397 --> 00:53:31,348
She's my soul mate, you know?

834
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,233
She doesn't even care.

835
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,569
But she's your soul mate, right?

836
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,571
Yeah.

837
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,157
Well, you just don't give up on her,
right?

838
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,452
Why not? You did.

839
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,164
I didn't give up.

840
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,036
Okay, it's more complicated than that.

841
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:53,462
I'm a different guy now.

842
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:56,332
You're not different.
You just have different clothes.

843
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:57,833
It's not that simple, kiddo.

844
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,919
- What kind of crap is that?
- Watch it.

845
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,054
You love her or you don't.
I know you do.

846
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:07,176
I'm serious, Dad. I just need some
inspiration right now. All right?

847
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,977
Go get her back.

848
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,109
Wow, how old are you?

849
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:45,806
You look great, Cal.

850
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:53,806
Well, it turns out I've been buying the
wrong size suit for like 20 years, so...

851
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:57,651
Oh, well, whatever.
You... You look great.

852
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,728
Thanks. You always look great.

853
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:01,363
Oh, thanks.

854
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,761
- So I spoke to Nanna yesterday.
- Yeah, me too. How'd she sound to you?

855
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:23,969
Like Nanna. She worries about us.

856
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:27,923
What teacher is this?

857
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,343
Ms. Tafferty. She's the one he pulled
the Scarlet Letter asshole routine on.

858
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:35,606
God, he's such a weird kid.

859
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,058
I kind of like him, though.

860
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:40,686
Yeah, me too. Glad we switched
babies at the hospital.

861
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:43,780
Me too. That other one's
in jail, probably.

862
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:56,035
So how's it going with David?

863
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:59,213
Oh, you know, it,

864
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,840
It wasn't,

865
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:06,337
That didn't mean anything.

866
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:08,889
- I mean, you know, if...
- No. No, I know.

867
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:14,978
You seeing anybody?

868
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:16,555
Me?

869
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,735
Oh, you know. Well, you hear things,
you know, so...

870
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:24,396
No. No. Not real...

871
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:26,114
You know me.

872
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:29,326
Yeah, well...

873
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:33,914
No.

874
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,798
I miss you, Em.

875
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:49,263
I made an effort when we were younger,
didn't I?

876
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:54,093
I mean, miniature golf and dancing.
You were such a great dancer.

877
00:56:54,394 --> 00:56:57,187
I had to be.
You were such a good miniature golfer.

878
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:02,067
I just... I don't know.
I guess I got lazy. I got...

879
00:57:03,278 --> 00:57:05,521
I got boring, is what I got.

880
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,905
No.

881
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,616
And I'm so mad at you.

882
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,536
I'm really mad at you for what you did.

883
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:15,038
But I'm mad at myself too.

884
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:23,046
Because I should not have jumped out of
that car. I should've fought for you.

885
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,052
Because you fight for your soul mates.

886
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,348
Least, that's what my 13-year-old son
tells me.

887
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,926
He's a really strange kid.

888
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:37,728
He scares the shit out of me.

889
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:42,524
I miss you too.

890
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:47,362
Mr. And Mrs. Weaver?

891
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:51,199
No way in hell.

892
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:55,446
- Cal, what are you doing here?
- Oh, you two know each other?

893
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:59,041
Yes. Yeah, right. We've
met before, yes.

894
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,911
"We have met before"? Seriously?

895
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:06,081
So I'd like to introduce you
to my wife, Emily.

896
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,342
Hi, I'm Robbie's mom.

897
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:12,721
She's your wife again. How convenient.

898
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,676
So shall we enter?

899
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:19,303
- Okay.
- Why don't we?

900
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:21,396
Yeah, let's do that.

901
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:28,562
I'm sorry. I'm playing catch-up. How
do you two know each other, exactly?

902
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:34,993
Maybe your husband should tell you.

903
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:42,626
We... I think we met at last year's
parent-teacher conference, wasn't it?

904
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,124
Did I miss it? Did I miss the
parent-teacher conference thing last year?

905
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,627
Yeah. I don't remember.

906
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,921
Why don't we just, focus on Robbie?

907
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:55,589
Yes.

908
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,935
Yes, let's do that. Let's...

909
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,105
Let's focus on Robbie.

910
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,480
As you know,
Robbie's shining moment...

911
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:15,617
was when he set a school record for
cursing in an eighth-grade English class.

912
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,617
Asshole.

913
00:59:23,918 --> 00:59:25,953
You're familiar with this word,
Mrs. Weaver.

914
00:59:26,254 --> 00:59:28,372
Yes, I am. And I've
spoken to Principal...

915
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:32,000
Asshole. As in someone who tells
a woman that he'll call and never does.

916
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:36,429
Asshole. As in someone who uses honesty
to get a woman into bed with him...

917
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:38,974
but is actually full of shit
like the rest of them.

918
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,552
This is not about Robbie.

919
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:46,515
Asshole. As in someone who allows a
woman to go downtown for 45 minutes...

920
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,142
because he's nervous.

921
00:59:48,443 --> 00:59:50,352
- All right, all right, all right.

922
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:51,895
You know what? Know what? No.

923
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:53,697
Here's the deal.

924
00:59:57,618 --> 00:59:59,236
She's an alcoholic.

925
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,488
- Oh, God. Okay.
- That's... I'm sorry.

926
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:03,157
- I'm sorry. God.
- I gotta go.

927
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,125
Oh, my God. Emily. God.

928
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:08,495
- Emily, Emily, wait.
- Leave me alone, Cal.

929
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:13,425
I'm sober five years, asshole!

930
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:17,087
Okay, yeah, I did. I did.

931
01:00:17,388 --> 01:00:20,257
I slept with our son's eighth-grade
English teacher.

932
01:00:20,558 --> 01:00:21,800
I know. I know.

933
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:25,262
And I cheated,
so I have no right to be angry.

934
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:28,307
Not the point. When we were
married you were the only woman...

935
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:29,933
that I had ever slept with...

936
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:33,111
and now I have had sex
with nine different women... God.

937
01:00:35,156 --> 01:00:38,241
Nine?

938
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:47,292
You showed me.

939
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:54,466
I wasn't trying to show you.

940
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,552
I was trying to move on.

941
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,557
But I don't want to.

942
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:10,440
You've always been the only one.

943
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:17,280
Tell her she's the perfect combination
of sexy and cute, asshole.

944
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,079
You said that to her?

945
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:32,212
I did, yes.

946
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:35,257
Who are you?

947
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,641
I'm your soul mate.

948
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,909
What a cliché.

949
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:40,989
You, get over here. Come on.

950
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,191
Yeah, yeah, give it up.
Give it up for her.

951
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:46,361
I'm so proud of you, baby.

952
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,371
I had my doubts, of course.

953
01:02:53,544 --> 01:02:58,673
Hannah, I did tell you that tonight would
be a special night if you passed the bar.

954
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:01,092
So, Hannah...

955
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:07,382
I would like to formally ask you...

956
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,893
in front of all our friends
and colleagues...

957
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:14,064
if you would like to become...

958
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:18,602
a permanent lawyer at the firm
of Watkins, Goldberg and Schmidt? Huh?

959
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:21,363
How about that? To you.

960
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,746
What?

961
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:33,541
- I ju...
- What, what is it?

962
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:41,091
I thought that you were gonna propose
for some reason.

963
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:45,045
- What?
- Yeah. I know. I'm just...

964
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:46,755
It's just, I'm a little thrown.

965
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,264
I'm sorry.

966
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,262
I didn't realize that you thought
that we were there.

967
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:57,724
Oh, no. God, no. Don't be silly.
I just...

968
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:00,519
I need some time, I think...

969
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,532
to figure out how I feel about us,
you know?

970
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,452
Long-term.

971
01:04:11,122 --> 01:04:13,164
You need some time?

972
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:17,035
You need some time to figure out
how you feel about us? Okay.

973
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,378
Honey?

974
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,678
This is actually really funny.
I'm just... Next level.

975
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:36,604
- Is this yours? Is this yours?
- Yes.

976
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:41,192
Honey?

977
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:43,820
- Is this gin?
- Yes.

978
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,324
- There's, like, no water in that.
- Yeah.

979
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,203
- Great.
- I hate gin.

980
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,740
Wow, you know what?
Thank you, Richard.

981
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:59,377
Honestly, thank you very much
for your job offer. I will consider it.

982
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,129
Hannah Banana.

983
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,507
Banana. Hannah.

984
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,216
- Do you wanna buy me a drink?
- Yes.

985
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:15,977
- It's nicer that way. Right?
- You.

986
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,004
You remember me?

987
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,248
Yeah.

988
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:47,584
- You still find me attractive?
- Yes.

989
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:49,594
Still wanna take me home?

990
01:05:51,055 --> 01:05:52,097
Yeah.

991
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:55,892
Let's go.

992
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:31,970
Just one look

993
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:35,924
And I fell so hard

994
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,392
Here.

995
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,763
I really like this song.
This was a good choice. Yeah.

996
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,266
Good song. You never hear this song.

997
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:45,608
Love this song.

998
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:49,821
Cheers.

999
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:56,987
How good it feels

1000
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,449
That's not my drink.

1001
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,326
Your love

1002
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:12,427
It's not my favorite. Thank you.

1003
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:16,431
Forever

1004
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:21,678
And always

1005
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:24,806
- So is this how it normally works?
- What?

1006
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,642
You put on the perfect song,
you make them a drink.

1007
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,146
And I knew

1008
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,772
And then you sleep together.

1009
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:34,365
That you

1010
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:38,244
Yeah.

1011
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:41,831
I'm very nervous.

1012
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,083
I'm getting that.

1013
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:47,245
Okay. Because I know I seemed confident
back at the bar...

1014
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:51,833
but that was mostly just
because I was cold and wet...

1015
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,636
and trying to be dramatic
a little bit.

1016
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,512
You're adorable.

1017
01:07:57,681 --> 01:07:58,723
No.

1018
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:00,216
I am sexy.

1019
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:02,510
I am R-rated sexy.

1020
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,139
Okay, I know what happens in the PG-13
version of tonight, all right? I know.

1021
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,435
It's that I get really drunk
and then I pass out.

1022
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:13,688
You cover me with a blanket,
kiss me on the cheek, nothing happens.

1023
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,157
But that's not why I'm here.

1024
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:21,204
I am here to bang the hot guy
that hit on me at the bar.

1025
01:08:22,831 --> 01:08:24,832
- Jacob.
- Jacob.

1026
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,953
- Are people still saying "bang"?
- I do.

1027
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:30,455
We are gonna bang.

1028
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:32,131
This is happening.

1029
01:08:32,883 --> 01:08:34,250
- Take off your shirt.
- Why?

1030
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:38,046
Please, will you take off your shirt? I
can't stop thinking. I need to just...

1031
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,598
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right, okay, okay, okay.

1032
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,058
Fuck.

1033
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,361
Seriously? It's like
you're Photoshopped.

1034
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:56,531
Can I...?

1035
01:08:57,574 --> 01:08:59,534
You have cold hands.

1036
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:02,362
- Now you take off your dress.
- No.

1037
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:05,365
- Yes.
- No. Not with that going on. No, thank you.

1038
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,167
Is there dim lighting somewhere?
Oh, God.

1039
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,664
Okay, so then what do we do?
What happens now? Like, logistically?

1040
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:15,750
- What's your move?
- What do you mean, what's my move?

1041
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,545
- What's your move? Your big move?
- I got lots of moves.

1042
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:20,547
- What's your big move?
- I'm not telling.

1043
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:23,258
- Tell me your move.
- You're not ready for the big move.

1044
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,635
- Yes, I am.
- You can't handle the big move.

1045
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:29,314
- Tell me your big move.
- I work Dirty Dancing into the conversation.

1046
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,059
Dirty Dancing?

1047
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,311
- Can I sit down, please?
- Yeah.

1048
01:09:35,612 --> 01:09:37,230
- Can I put back on my shirt?
- No.

1049
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:39,733
Why Dirty Dancing? What do we do?
Do we watch it?

1050
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:44,112
You know the big move at the end where
Patrick Swayze picks up Jennifer Grey?

1051
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,289
- Yeah.
- I can do that.

1052
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:50,076
- Okay.
- So I tell girls I can do the move.

1053
01:09:50,377 --> 01:09:54,088
I put on the song "Time of Your Life."
I do the big move.

1054
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,416
And they always wanna have sex
with me.

1055
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:59,586
Oh, my God. That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

1056
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:02,138
I agree. But it works every time.

1057
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,390
That would not work on me.

1058
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:12,724
Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
I don't wanna do it.

1059
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:13,933
Come on.

1060
01:10:14,234 --> 01:10:15,977
This is beyond ridiculous.

1061
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,645
- Run and jump.
- No.

1062
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:19,614
- Yeah. Come on.
- No, thank you.

1063
01:10:20,824 --> 01:10:22,617
Thank God I'm drunk. Here we go.

1064
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:32,952
'Cause I've had the time of my life

1065
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:37,799
And I owe it all to you

1066
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,007
I've been waiting for so long

1067
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:50,853
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me

1068
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:56,101
So do you prefer to do it here
or in the bedroom?

1069
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:57,435
The bedroom is preferred.

1070
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:00,488
Yeah, okay. Let's go there.

1071
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,231
This pillow...

1072
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,986
forms perfectly
to the shape of my head.

1073
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:43,448
Yeah.

1074
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:50,913
Is this one of those foam pillows
from Brookstone?

1075
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,374
Yeah.

1076
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,877
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1077
01:11:56,837 --> 01:11:59,464
I always wondered
who buys those kind of...

1078
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:02,917
The hot guy from the bar buys these.
Of course.

1079
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,586
- Jacob.
- Jacob. Sorry about that.

1080
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:05,928
Good.

1081
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:09,015
I'm sorry, continue.

1082
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:33,206
You don't have one of those ridiculous,
um, massage chairs, do you?

1083
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:38,828
- You do?
- No.

1084
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:40,622
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah, I do.

1085
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,333
- Oh, my God.
- I don't. I don't. I do.

1086
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:45,760
Who would have that?
I would. I have that.

1087
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:47,858
- How much was it?
- Five thousand dollars.

1088
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:51,007
Ask me how many times I've used it.

1089
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:53,476
- How many times have you used it?
- Twice.

1090
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:55,845
That's $2500 a massage.

1091
01:12:56,146 --> 01:12:57,772
Twice.

1092
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:01,275
- Where is it?
- It's in the garage.

1093
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,569
Can I sit in the massage chair?

1094
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:09,909
I hate it.

1095
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:14,322
The Home Shopping Network. But I'm
addic... I buy... I'm just the worst.

1096
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:15,990
- Do you have a Slap Chop?
- Yes.

1097
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,159
- The knife that cuts through the penny?
- Yes.

1098
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,162
- What else do you have?
- Coin Bears.

1099
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,665
Coin Bears?
You don't have Coin Bears.

1100
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,625
I have a whole set from each state.

1101
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:27,210
You have 50 Coin Bears?

1102
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,837
- They have a coin in their foot.
- You stay up nights.

1103
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:31,722
I am wildly unhappy.

1104
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,552
I'm trying to buy it,
and it's not working.

1105
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:39,055
- Were you smart in school?
- A little bossy, yeah.

1106
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:43,810
But I won a spelling bee
and my dad cried at the spelling bee.

1107
01:13:44,111 --> 01:13:45,853
No way. That's nice.

1108
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:48,106
- What word did you win on?
- It was so stupid.

1109
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:51,492
I love curling up with
a rich cup of coffee.

1110
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:54,195
What, you think coffee and sleep
don't mix?

1111
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,574
Well, they do if it's High Point.
It's decaffeinated.

1112
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,119
And the flavor is marvelous.

1113
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,705
Do you have that mold
that makes cakes...?

1114
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,047
I have calf pants.

1115
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,885
I have pants just for my calves.
Calf pants.

1116
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:19,020
Oh, my God.

1117
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,108
Could you do me a favor?

1118
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:25,977
- What?
- Will you do me a kindness?

1119
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:32,734
Will you ask me something personal
about myself?

1120
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,903
Okay, fine. I'll do it.
And then we bang.

1121
01:14:36,204 --> 01:14:37,363
Yes.

1122
01:14:37,664 --> 01:14:38,873
What's your mother like?

1123
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:44,579
My mom is very beautiful.

1124
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,049
Very vain.

1125
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,509
Very smart.

1126
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:52,503
Cold.

1127
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,305
And your dad?

1128
01:14:57,643 --> 01:15:00,311
He died a long time ago.

1129
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,431
He was such a sweet guy.

1130
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,566
He was probably too sweet.

1131
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,897
Very successful in business.

1132
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:16,319
He made a lot of money,
which is why I have all this stuff.

1133
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,412
But he was soft.

1134
01:15:19,498 --> 01:15:22,116
Just too soft, too sensitive.

1135
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,621
And, you know, Dad,
he couldn't really handle my mother...

1136
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,715
and didn't really make an effort.

1137
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:02,782
Hey, Jacob, it's Cal.

1138
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,325
Where are you?

1139
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,662
Remember the first woman I picked up,
that teacher?

1140
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,643
Well, I have a story to tell you
about her.

1141
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,709
It's been a week. I haven't heard
from you. Should I be concerned?

1142
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,470
I am imagining you suffocating
under a pile of women. Call me.

1143
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,974
Yeah, hey, it's me again.

1144
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,352
Left like a hundred messages.

1145
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,483
Listen, if this is a Miyagi thing,
I'm not getting it, so...

1146
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,486
Call me back, please. Thanks.

1147
01:16:56,595 --> 01:16:59,297
- Been to St. Louis?
- No, I haven't.

1148
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:03,426
I always dreamt of playing shortstop for
the St. Louis Cardinals, actually...

1149
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:06,721
but I couldn't hit a curveball,
so I did the next best thing.

1150
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,431
Yeah, you became an accountant.

1151
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:09,849
Right. Exactly.

1152
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,643
I mean, the money's not as good,
but there's less travel.

1153
01:17:14,154 --> 01:17:16,397
- I was gonna be a ballerina.
- Really?

1154
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,816
So tell me, what is it with women
and ballerinas?

1155
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,319
I just pictured myself in the ballet.

1156
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,113
It's not like I had
a lot of training or anything.

1157
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:26,949
I mean, I actually never really
had a lesson...

1158
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:30,711
and, um, haven't seen a ballet.

1159
01:17:31,296 --> 01:17:32,663
You've never been to the ballet?

1160
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:38,461
- I'd love to take you to the ballet.
- You'd love to go to the ballet?

1161
01:17:38,762 --> 01:17:42,006
I didn't say that. I'd love to take you
to the ballet. I'd drop you off.

1162
01:17:42,307 --> 01:17:45,134
Later on I'd pick you up
and we could go to a ball game.

1163
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:46,560
Oh, I get it.

1164
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:52,691
I had a lot of fun tonight.

1165
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,146
You like sushi? I know this really
great little sushi place...

1166
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:58,356
I don't eat sushi.

1167
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,075
That we're never gonna go to
because I hate sushi.

1168
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:12,954
Oh, hi. Hi, Jess.

1169
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,623
This is my work friend, David.

1170
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,333
David is an accountant.

1171
01:18:17,634 --> 01:18:19,760
David, this is Jessica, my babysitter.

1172
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:24,966
So, you know, everything looks great.

1173
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,310
Spreadsheets.

1174
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:32,848
See you at work.

1175
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:34,775
Yeah, see you at work.

1176
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:40,940
So how was dinner?

1177
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:43,401
- Oh, well, you know, it was just for work.
- Yeah.

1178
01:18:43,702 --> 01:18:47,246
- That's a really pretty dress.
- Thank you. What do I owe you?

1179
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:50,950
Do you know that your kids
are the only ones that I babysit for...

1180
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:54,879
that wanna stay awake so that they
can see their dad when he gets home?

1181
01:18:55,964 --> 01:19:00,418
Yeah, I mean, they fight with everything
they have to keep their eyes open.

1182
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,211
And don't get me wrong...

1183
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:07,224
no, your kids are really excited to see
you when you get home too, Ms. Weaver...

1184
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:11,478
but not a lot wanna stay up for Dad.

1185
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:16,225
Honey, what are you trying to say?

1186
01:19:16,526 --> 01:19:17,476
Batshit crazy.

1187
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:19,478
Jessica, what...?

1188
01:19:19,779 --> 01:19:22,231
- Let me give you...
- I don't want your slutty money.

1189
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:26,285
Sweetheart, what's the pro...?
What's wrong?

1190
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,290
"Slutty money"?

1191
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:28,574
Kids.

1192
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:34,747
Kids. Ice cream.

1193
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,427
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

1194
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,651
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

1195
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,032
Hello?

1196
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,209
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

1197
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:24,580
So...

1198
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:28,550
I'm just calling,

1199
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,047
because I'm in the basement...

1200
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,183
and I'm trying to get
the water heater working,

1201
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:41,396
because the pilot light's out
and I don't know how to relight it.

1202
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,682
So I'm sorry to bother you.

1203
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:47,528
No, no. It's fine. That's fine.
Call me...

1204
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,481
I'm glad you called about this.

1205
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:53,075
- I'll just walk you through it, okay?
- Okay.

1206
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:58,656
All right, so there's a gray door.
You see the gray door?

1207
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:02,042
- Yeah.
- Okay, just slide that down.

1208
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:04,245
Okay.

1209
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:07,498
There's a red button
with the word "push" on it.

1210
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:09,758
I wrote the word "push" on it?

1211
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,255
So you push it.
And you turn it to the right.

1212
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,889
I got it.

1213
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,267
And then just put the match in.

1214
01:23:21,354 --> 01:23:23,063
Oh, there it goes.

1215
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:27,276
Just have to slide the gray door
down again and you're good to go.

1216
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,277
Well, thanks, Cal. I
appreciate your help.

1217
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:40,330
Oh, you know what? Just call anytime
with stuff like that. That's...

1218
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:43,868
Oh, yeah.

1219
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:45,502
Yeah.

1220
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:47,337
Sure.

1221
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:49,756
So I'll talk to you soon.

1222
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,259
Yeah, and,

1223
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,671
Thanks again.

1224
01:23:55,972 --> 01:23:58,599
No, that's... My pleasure.

1225
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:02,936
Don't want you to blow up the house.

1226
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,483
Bye.

1227
01:24:27,086 --> 01:24:29,163
- Dad, can we go to McDonald's?
- No.

1228
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:30,589
Why not?

1229
01:24:32,091 --> 01:24:33,250
Check it out.

1230
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:35,502
Only reason they play them
is they're catchy.

1231
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:37,546
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

1232
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:39,214
Now, does it come in sheets...?

1233
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:42,593
Oh, yeah, it's a 4 by 8. Standard 4
by 8, your 3/4 inch stock. Yeah.

1234
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:45,679
- Now, this is for my wife.
- That's nice.

1235
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,014
It has curtains.

1236
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,475
- Oh, hey, Cal.
- Hey, Bernie.

1237
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:50,351
- Hi, Mr. Riley.
- Hi, Mr. Riley.

1238
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,719
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.

1239
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,688
I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing
something to the house later.

1240
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:56,190
Kind of in a rush.

1241
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:57,858
Thanks for the cologne.

1242
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,826
Do you know if this is chintz?

1243
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,613
- Hello?
- Cal.

1244
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:04,657
- Jacob.
- Oh, my God, it's alive.

1245
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:07,242
Hey, sorry I kind of dropped off
the grid there, pal.

1246
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:09,912
You left me in my hour of need,
my friend.

1247
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:11,121
Yeah, well...

1248
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:14,375
I'm in a bit of a situation.

1249
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,085
A pickle, if you will.

1250
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:18,428
I got no one else to call.

1251
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:20,714
- I met a girl.
- Oh, really?

1252
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,134
I'm spending all this time with her
and she is a game changer.

1253
01:25:24,435 --> 01:25:26,345
She's a game changer? No way.

1254
01:25:26,646 --> 01:25:28,764
So much so I'm going to meet
her mother right now.

1255
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:32,101
A mother and daughter. That's very
Wilt Chamberlain-esque, even for you.

1256
01:25:32,402 --> 01:25:33,769
What is the matter with you?

1257
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,063
I don't know what to do.
I need some advice.

1258
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,067
You might actually have to answer
some personal questions about yourself.

1259
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,444
You gotta smile a lot.
You've gotta be charming.

1260
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:43,905
Definitely don't be yourself.

1261
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:45,878
That's what you've got for me,
don't be myself?

1262
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,492
Great. Thanks for nothing.

1263
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:50,085
Do you wanna get a?

1264
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,913
Do you wanna get a beer next week?

1265
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:54,832
You have my number.

1266
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,626
And, you know, don't worry
about tonight. You'll be fine.

1267
01:25:57,927 --> 01:26:00,470
- Good for you, by the way.
- See you, buddy.

1268
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:04,099
Honk. You gotta get that fixed.

1269
01:26:05,893 --> 01:26:08,562
- Okay. All right.
- Let's go.

1270
01:26:31,627 --> 01:26:33,003
Va-jay-jay.

1271
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,889
Out of this fourth inning
with just one run in.

1272
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:56,435
He's right on the verge of a big hit
knocking him out of the game here.

1273
01:26:56,736 --> 01:26:59,654
He's staying in there,
very competitive today.

1274
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:22,386
No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

1275
01:27:23,388 --> 01:27:25,839
No, leave him. Let him go.
He can handle it. Let him go.

1276
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,342
Honey! Get out of my purse.
Stay out of my purse!

1277
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:32,471
Do not take those keys! Do not take those
keys! I'm not letting you take those keys.

1278
01:27:32,772 --> 01:27:35,265
You're not following your father!
Stop it!

1279
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:38,560
No! No! Let your father handle it.
You're not to see that man again!

1280
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:39,853
That man's a pervert!

1281
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:41,271
- Stay out of it!
- No!

1282
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:43,156
Is that pervert sexting you?

1283
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:44,616
Hey, baby.

1284
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:46,193
What are you wearing?

1285
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:49,530
Dad's here. I have to blindfold you.

1286
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,416
- Why? What's he doing?
- Just come on.

1287
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,804
Hate this. Bad.

1288
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,275
Is this something
I'm gonna have to clean up?

1289
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:11,385
Mom, no, don't worry about it.
Keep going.

1290
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:14,054
- Honey, honey, I really can't see.
- Mom, I got you.

1291
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:16,723
Two. Right now we're on the ground.
One more step.

1292
01:28:17,024 --> 01:28:18,225
- Three.
- Three. Yay.

1293
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,561
Mom, no more steps.
We're on the ground.

1294
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,730
Mom, relax.
It's your husband, not Al Qaeda.

1295
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:24,898
Hi, Em.

1296
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,568
Oh, hey. Can I take
this off now, please?

1297
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,703
- Nope, not yet.
- Oh, what's this?

1298
01:28:31,038 --> 01:28:32,706
- I hear you, gigglepuss.
- Do it.

1299
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,087
May I have your attention?

1300
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:46,920
Many years ago, in the hallway
of Woodside Middle School...

1301
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,424
Cal Weaver saw Emily Boyle
for the first time.

1302
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,552
Cal, are you seriously gonna do this
in front of the kids?

1303
01:28:55,062 --> 01:28:58,231
If anything goes wrong I'm supposed to
take her upstairs and put the TV on loud.

1304
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:01,602
All right. Well, we may as well wait
for your daughter.

1305
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,438
- She's right here.
- No, no, no. I mean our other daughter.

1306
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:05,898
- Hello?
- Nanna.

1307
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:08,442
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sweetheart.

1308
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,360
- Hi.
- What's going on?

1309
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:14,281
Oh, I don't know. Some game. He won't
let me take this dumb blindfold off.

1310
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,166
- Cal?
- Is that him?

1311
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:17,618
What are you doing here?

1312
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:20,746
- What are you doing here?
- Wait, do you guys know each other?

1313
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:22,915
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1314
01:29:23,216 --> 01:29:25,250
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, Robbie.

1315
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:26,835
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, cutie.

1316
01:29:27,136 --> 01:29:28,416
Jacob, it's so nice to meet you.

1317
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,089
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you from Nanna.

1318
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:32,966
- I'm sorry, what's a Nanna?
- I am.

1319
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,260
I couldn't say Hannah.
How do you know my dad?

1320
01:29:35,561 --> 01:29:37,638
She couldn't say her H's at all.

1321
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:40,941
Okay. I'm having trouble understanding
what's going on right now.

1322
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,437
- Dad, this is Jacob, my boyfriend.
- No, it's not.

1323
01:29:45,738 --> 01:29:48,315
- I was bringing him over to meet Mom.
- No. No. No, no, no.

1324
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,567
- I wanna see the boyfriend.
- I can't breathe.

1325
01:29:50,868 --> 01:29:51,902
Can I take this off?

1326
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,613
Cal, what are you doing
with a daughter that's grown up?

1327
01:29:54,914 --> 01:29:57,241
I was 17. That's why we had to get
married so young.

1328
01:29:57,542 --> 01:30:00,369
- You should have told me.
- Never wanted me to talk about my children.

1329
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,956
- Um, I'm gonna go watch TV now.
- That's fine. Why don't you go do that?

1330
01:30:04,257 --> 01:30:05,499
- Yeah. Can I come?
- No.

1331
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,960
So you guys, like,
really know each other, then.

1332
01:30:08,261 --> 01:30:10,754
Oh, screw it. This is ridiculous.

1333
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:12,798
- Honey, he's really cute.
- No, he's not.

1334
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:15,684
Look at you. You're really a mother?
I don't believe it, sister.

1335
01:30:16,185 --> 01:30:18,345
Let me get this straight.
So you guys are a thing.

1336
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:20,889
You guys are a couple, right?
You guys are together?

1337
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,191
- Yeah.
- No way. Break up right now.

1338
01:30:23,568 --> 01:30:25,318
- Daddy?
- Please don't call him that.

1339
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:28,647
- Cal, that's not gonna happen.
- Then I will mess you up.

1340
01:30:28,948 --> 01:30:29,898
- Dad.
- Cal.

1341
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:31,108
- Cal.
- Jessica?

1342
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:32,450
Bernie?

1343
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,153
Daddy, no.

1344
01:30:35,454 --> 01:30:38,373
I let her babysit for you,
you son of a bitch.

1345
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:41,576
- She's only 17 years old.
- What are you talking about?

1346
01:30:41,877 --> 01:30:43,717
- Oh, God.
- No idea what you're talking about.

1347
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:44,997
Bernie.

1348
01:30:45,298 --> 01:30:48,425
Daddy, no. No, no, no. Stop it.

1349
01:30:50,553 --> 01:30:52,254
- Dad.
- Jacob! Oh, God.

1350
01:30:52,555 --> 01:30:54,006
Stop it. He didn't do anything.

1351
01:30:54,307 --> 01:30:55,924
- He doesn't know.
- Is your back okay?

1352
01:30:56,225 --> 01:30:57,592
- Know what?
- Know what?

1353
01:30:57,893 --> 01:30:59,928
Is this some kind of a skit?
Because I'm lost.

1354
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:01,138
No.

1355
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:03,890
No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy.

1356
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:05,991
He didn't even know
that I'm in love with him.

1357
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,186
- With who?
- With him.

1358
01:31:08,487 --> 01:31:10,272
- You pointing at me?
- You pointing at him?

1359
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:12,232
She's pointing at him?

1360
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:15,235
Wait. My dad is the older guy
you've been seeing?

1361
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:18,488
- I knew it. You...
- He doesn't know about the naked photos.

1362
01:31:18,789 --> 01:31:20,407
- What?
- Jessica.

1363
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,326
You made him naked photos? Seriously?

1364
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:26,121
- I'm gonna beat you till your brains fall out.
- Timeout, timeout. Hold on.

1365
01:31:26,422 --> 01:31:29,291
- But I love her.
- Jessica's the one you're in love with?

1366
01:31:29,592 --> 01:31:31,384
Excuse me, Emily?

1367
01:31:32,178 --> 01:31:34,421
- You left your sweater in my car.

1368
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:36,264
- Who are you?
- David Lindhagen.

1369
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:40,226
- David Lindhagen?
- David Lindhagen.

1370
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:42,929
Okay.

1371
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,182
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

1372
01:31:46,683 --> 01:31:47,308
Jacob!

1373
01:31:47,652 --> 01:31:50,145
Know how much pain and suffering
you caused my friend?

1374
01:31:50,446 --> 01:31:52,147
Stay the hell away from my daughter.

1375
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,024
You stay away from my daughter.

1376
01:31:54,325 --> 01:31:56,276
- I don't even know you.
- Stop it.

1377
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:58,870
Oh, my God. That is not...
What are you grabbing?

1378
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:03,617
- Really? Really?
- Come on.

1379
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,495
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go of me!

1380
01:32:06,796 --> 01:32:08,955
- Come on, she's my daughter.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1381
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:10,256
I'll kill you.

1382
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:13,835
So...

1383
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,338
Okay, wait. Which one of you
is Lindhagen again?

1384
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:17,764
Hagen.

1385
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:21,134
I'm just gonna write,
"Domestic disturbance, all clear."

1386
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:22,602
Thank you, officer.

1387
01:32:23,646 --> 01:32:26,765
Just simmer down, okay?
We all have arguments.

1388
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:30,777
But if you're gonna fight, just do it
inside. Keep it in the family, okay?

1389
01:32:32,863 --> 01:32:33,988
I will kill you.

1390
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:45,867
Let's go.

1391
01:32:46,168 --> 01:32:47,293
- Daddy?
- Now.

1392
01:32:47,712 --> 01:32:49,629
- Daddy?
- Now.

1393
01:33:21,871 --> 01:33:22,946
Cal.

1394
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:24,414
Come on.

1395
01:33:24,915 --> 01:33:25,957
Honey.

1396
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:31,997
This guy is a lowlife,
he is a womanizer.

1397
01:33:32,298 --> 01:33:35,049
- That's ironic.
- Excuse me?

1398
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:41,715
I know him.
I have witnessed him in action.

1399
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,886
- And you are not to see him anymore.
- Dad, I'm not gonna stop seeing him.

1400
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,355
Okay. Okay. Well, then we have
nothing more to talk about.

1401
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,970
- You're being unreasonable.
- Get out of my house.

1402
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,310
This is not your house anymore.

1403
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,324
Well, you made damn sure of that,
didn't you, sweetheart?

1404
01:34:13,589 --> 01:34:15,882
- Bye, Nanna.
- Bye, cutie.

1405
01:34:27,102 --> 01:34:28,645
She's all yours, David.

1406
01:34:30,105 --> 01:34:33,483
- Fantastic.
- Nice.

1407
01:34:41,784 --> 01:34:43,701
Go big or go home, right, bud?

1408
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:47,205
Go home, Dad.

1409
01:35:44,346 --> 01:35:46,214
- Did you see the headline today?
- What?

1410
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:49,175
It says that you should call your dad.

1411
01:35:49,476 --> 01:35:51,678
No, it says,
"Let's move on child obesity.".

1412
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:53,513
No, it doesn't.

1413
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:56,816
- I'm not gonna call him.
- No, it says you really should.

1414
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,523
Can I get you another?

1415
01:36:38,567 --> 01:36:40,693
- What time is it?
- 2:30.

1416
01:36:41,737 --> 01:36:43,321
In the afternoon.

1417
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:45,649
"Two-thirty" would have
been sufficient...

1418
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:49,619
but thank you for the judgmental tone,
cocktail servant.

1419
01:36:50,412 --> 01:36:51,454
I'm sorry...

1420
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,667
Sorry for being a dick.

1421
01:36:58,379 --> 01:36:59,963
Nice sweat suit.

1422
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:05,593
What do you want?

1423
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:09,639
- Can I sit down?
- I don't know, can you?

1424
01:37:10,474 --> 01:37:13,927
Are we gonna be adults about this,
or we gonna...?

1425
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,396
"Are we gonna be adults about this?"

1426
01:37:24,947 --> 01:37:28,992
- It would mean a lot to me if we could talk.
- Are you still seeing my daughter?

1427
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:34,455
- Yes.
- Then I have nothing to say to you.

1428
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:37,166
Been hanging out here a lot?

1429
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,002
Sometimes.

1430
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:44,499
- You been missing a lot of work?
- I have a lot of vacation days.

1431
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,093
You know what? You have a lot of nerve.

1432
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,389
Do you wanna do your shot?

1433
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:02,775
She probably spit in it,
so, no, thank you.

1434
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,355
Your kids miss you, Cal.

1435
01:38:07,656 --> 01:38:10,191
You're hanging out with my kids?
That's great.

1436
01:38:10,492 --> 01:38:12,952
Teach Robbie how to objectify women.
He'll love that.

1437
01:38:16,623 --> 01:38:20,710
You know it's his eighth-grade
graduation next week.

1438
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:22,620
You gonna go to that?

1439
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:23,997
Of course I'm going.

1440
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:28,334
I just didn't know. You haven't really been
around. I don't think he knows either.

1441
01:38:28,635 --> 01:38:31,504
I haven't been around for him?
That's what you're telling me?

1442
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:33,715
You know,
he's not my biggest fan right now.

1443
01:38:34,016 --> 01:38:36,634
- He thinks I stole his soul mate.
- He worships you, Cal.

1444
01:38:36,935 --> 01:38:40,229
- Is the parental advice over? Because if so...
- I'm in love with her.

1445
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,150
I love her.

1446
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:48,688
I don't know what I was doing
before this.

1447
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:54,077
And I don't know what to do about it.
It's not something I can really stop.

1448
01:38:54,578 --> 01:38:56,237
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1449
01:38:56,538 --> 01:38:58,156
- You love her? You love Hannah?
- Yes.

1450
01:38:58,457 --> 01:39:02,001
Tell me about it.
Tell me how much you love her.

1451
01:39:02,419 --> 01:39:03,503
I'm just...

1452
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:07,040
Look, Cal, it's not something
that I wanted, okay?

1453
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,042
I looked at people who were in love...

1454
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,628
and I thought
the way that they were behaving...

1455
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:14,214
and the things that they were doing
and saying...

1456
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,674
they appeared pathetic, honestly.

1457
01:39:16,975 --> 01:39:20,345
And I spent all this time with you,
I'm trying to make you more like me...

1458
01:39:20,646 --> 01:39:23,064
and it turns out I just wanna be...

1459
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:29,229
I need that drink.

1460
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,823
You gonna make me do this?
I gotta really do this?

1461
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:40,039
I had Hannah when I was 17.

1462
01:39:40,624 --> 01:39:43,042
I taught her how to ride a bike.

1463
01:39:44,419 --> 01:39:46,879
I taught her how to drive a car.

1464
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:49,916
And I'm glad for you.

1465
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:54,178
I'm happy for you, that you've changed.

1466
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:59,350
I think it's fantastic
that you're a better man.

1467
01:40:00,602 --> 01:40:02,512
But I've seen too much already.

1468
01:40:02,813 --> 01:40:07,316
- No. I know. I know too much.
- I know. I know.

1469
01:40:08,944 --> 01:40:10,403
And it's Hannah.

1470
01:40:10,737 --> 01:40:12,738
And she's too good for you.

1471
01:40:13,448 --> 01:40:14,782
I agree.

1472
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:21,414
I'm never gonna give you my approval.

1473
01:40:31,383 --> 01:40:33,467
You're a good dad, Cal.

1474
01:40:47,983 --> 01:40:49,058
Yep. Yep.

1475
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:51,944
She spit. She spit in that.

1476
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:53,855
Guys, I need you to pay attention.

1477
01:40:54,156 --> 01:40:58,318
Do not cut the line. I need everyone
to stay in your positions, okay?

1478
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:02,822
Guys, check your ties.
Make sure everything is nice and neat.

1479
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:04,832
Ladies, when you're on stage...

1480
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,594
Mommy, look. Robbie's name.

1481
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:40,117
Excuse me. Is this open?

1482
01:41:56,134 --> 01:41:57,843
- How close?
- Yeah, that's fine.

1483
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:07,095
Good afternoon.

1484
01:42:07,396 --> 01:42:10,523
Welcome, parents, family and friends.

1485
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:14,860
We're so pleased to have you here
to celebrate this graduating class.

1486
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:19,732
And now, to introduce
our first student speaker...

1487
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:23,786
our very own Kate Tafferty.

1488
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:28,666
She's pretty.

1489
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:36,382
Our first speaker is not only
the class salutatorian...

1490
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:39,844
but is also...

1491
01:42:41,346 --> 01:42:44,590
one of the most spirited young men...

1492
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:47,468
I've ever had the pleasure of teaching.

1493
01:42:47,769 --> 01:42:51,480
Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver.

1494
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:55,234
Robbie!

1495
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,495
Welcome, class of 2011.

1496
01:43:07,372 --> 01:43:10,616
Our time as middle schoolers
has come to an end.

1497
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:13,586
We can't fight it anymore.
We're getting old.

1498
01:43:19,885 --> 01:43:23,429
All my life I wanted to grow up.

1499
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:28,267
I wanted to grow older
so people would take me seriously.

1500
01:43:28,935 --> 01:43:32,438
It all sounded so good to me.

1501
01:43:32,773 --> 01:43:37,234
Growing up, getting a job,
getting married.

1502
01:43:37,944 --> 01:43:39,278
But...

1503
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,655
it's all a scam.

1504
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:43,949
And love?

1505
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:46,827
That's the biggest scam of all.

1506
01:43:49,414 --> 01:43:51,457
I was in love.

1507
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:56,462
And I know that makes some of you laugh
because I'm only 13...

1508
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:00,383
but whatever. I was.

1509
01:44:02,052 --> 01:44:05,429
And I used to think,
and really believe...

1510
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,475
that there was one true love
for everyone...

1511
01:44:09,976 --> 01:44:13,346
and if you fought hard enough
for that person...

1512
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:15,648
your one true love
would always work out.

1513
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:21,570
It sounded good to me when I was younger,
but it just doesn't work that way.

1514
01:44:23,281 --> 01:44:27,493
- There is no such thing as one true love...
- Stop.

1515
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:33,991
Shit.

1516
01:44:34,292 --> 01:44:36,911
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1517
01:44:37,212 --> 01:44:39,547
All right. Excuse me.

1518
01:44:52,436 --> 01:44:55,646
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1519
01:44:56,189 --> 01:44:58,732
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1520
01:44:59,234 --> 01:45:01,360
I was wrong, Dad.
There's no such thing as...

1521
01:45:03,613 --> 01:45:04,864
I...

1522
01:45:12,247 --> 01:45:15,950
Well, here's the thing:

1523
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:18,878
My son's graduation speech sucks.

1524
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,380
That's not a joke.

1525
01:45:22,507 --> 01:45:25,918
In fairness, I didn't know
where he was going with that.

1526
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:27,753
But I think we can all agree...

1527
01:45:28,054 --> 01:45:33,684
it was headed
in a kind of depressing... way.

1528
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:38,598
My son... Not him, my actual son.

1529
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:41,350
Believes in grand romantic gestures.

1530
01:45:41,651 --> 01:45:44,937
He believes in the existence...

1531
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:47,573
of one's soul mate.

1532
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:52,028
And it's easy to just look
at a 13-year-old and say:

1533
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:56,407
"You don't know what you're
talking about. You are wrong."

1534
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,001
But I'm not so sure.

1535
01:46:03,048 --> 01:46:06,175
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old.

1536
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,586
We went out for ice cream.

1537
01:46:08,887 --> 01:46:13,466
After, my dad started teasing me
about my first date, the way dads do.

1538
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:16,469
And I told him, "Dad, it's no big deal.

1539
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:22,016
I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different
girls on a lot of different dates."

1540
01:46:22,317 --> 01:46:25,819
And that is the first time
that I ever lied to my father.

1541
01:46:29,241 --> 01:46:31,776
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old...

1542
01:46:32,077 --> 01:46:36,830
and I have loved her
every minute of every day...

1543
01:46:37,415 --> 01:46:41,252
since I first bought her
that mint chocolate chip cone.

1544
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:47,675
I have loved her through the birth
of my three perfect children.

1545
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:51,136
I have loved her
even when I've hated her.

1546
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:55,140
Only married couples
will understand that one.

1547
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:02,523
And I don't know if
it's gonna work out.

1548
01:47:04,526 --> 01:47:06,569
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1549
01:47:08,613 --> 01:47:11,574
I'm sorry, Robbie, I
can't give you that.

1550
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:14,910
But I can promise you this:

1551
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,413
I will never stop trying.

1552
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:21,917
Because when you find the one...

1553
01:47:22,377 --> 01:47:23,919
you never give up.

1554
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:31,552
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

1555
01:47:33,388 --> 01:47:35,108
I still love you, Jessica.

1556
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:39,768
And I love you, Emily.

1557
01:47:41,855 --> 01:47:44,932
I loved you ever since you first
changed my sister's diaper.

1558
01:47:45,233 --> 01:47:49,061
I loved you when you came into my
bedroom and I was under the covers...

1559
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:51,063
- Stop him.
- No, no.

1560
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:53,524
- What's he talking about?
- I'm not ashamed of it.

1561
01:47:53,825 --> 01:47:55,868
Okay, we're good, we're good.

1562
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:08,172
Oh, there's your mom. Let's go say hi.

1563
01:48:08,506 --> 01:48:09,540
Hey.

1564
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:12,126
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1565
01:48:12,427 --> 01:48:14,462
There she is. My perfect girl.

1566
01:48:14,763 --> 01:48:16,305
Hi.

1567
01:48:21,186 --> 01:48:22,728
Okay.

1568
01:48:23,855 --> 01:48:25,272
So I bought a firearm...

1569
01:48:26,775 --> 01:48:27,935
from a shady Internet site...

1570
01:48:28,234 --> 01:48:30,361
and I am prepared to shoot you with it.

1571
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:34,156
Come here.

1572
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,872
Take care of her.

1573
01:48:46,878 --> 01:48:51,048
This is gonna be fun.

1574
01:48:55,303 --> 01:48:56,629
I'm gonna talk to my friends.

1575
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:00,766
Go hang with the other high schoolers.
Go ahead, see if I care. I don't care.

1576
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:37,586
I'm really glad you came.

1577
01:49:37,887 --> 01:49:39,388
So am I.

1578
01:49:40,765 --> 01:49:43,058
You were a really good babysitter,
Jessica.

1579
01:49:44,853 --> 01:49:46,979
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

1580
01:49:48,273 --> 01:49:50,474
- I thought you weren't giving up.
- I'm not.

1581
01:49:50,775 --> 01:49:52,101
But I just figure...

1582
01:49:52,402 --> 01:49:53,727
you like my dad...

1583
01:49:54,028 --> 01:49:56,021
and in a few years I'll look like him.

1584
01:49:56,322 --> 01:49:57,489
I'll come for you then.

1585
01:49:58,324 --> 01:49:59,783
That's not a bad plan.

1586
01:50:00,243 --> 01:50:01,326
But...

1587
01:50:02,036 --> 01:50:04,029
Well, until then...

1588
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,459
just a little graduation gift
to get you through high school.

1589
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:10,961
Thanks.

1590
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:20,512
So...

1591
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:24,008
Can you...?

1592
01:50:24,309 --> 01:50:26,351
- Why...?
- Take care, Robbie.

1593
01:50:52,253 --> 01:50:54,546
Holy crap.

1594
01:51:03,515 --> 01:51:07,184
- He looks pretty happy.
- Yeah.

1595
01:51:07,977 --> 01:51:09,762
God, I hate that haircut, though.

1596
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:13,273
I know. He looks like a sheepdog.

1597
01:51:18,404 --> 01:51:22,574
Oh, my eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

1598
01:51:27,413 --> 01:51:29,414
It's been a really hard year.

1599
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,084
How so?

1600
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,792
Yeah, there were a couple little blips,
I guess.

1601
01:51:40,093 --> 01:51:43,095
- I know.
- I guess I just, you know...

1602
01:51:43,805 --> 01:51:47,099
Really what I want to say...

1603
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:52,396
is that I'm so glad you bought me
that ice cream.

1604
01:51:55,149 --> 01:51:57,442
Me too.
