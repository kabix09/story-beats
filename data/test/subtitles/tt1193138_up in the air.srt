305
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,425
I didn't even want to
have to ask you this.

306
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:28,461
Because I know how
you are about doing
things for others,

307
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,164
But we're coming up
on three weeks
to go to Julie's wedding.

308
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,233
And there's something
we could really
use your help on.

309
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,434
Yeah?

310
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:36,103
<i>We've been sending
people these kits.</i>

311
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,772
So they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardboard.

312
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,341
And then take photos of them
in interesting places,

313
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,143
Kind of like that gnome
in the French movie.

314
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,845
Why?

315
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:47,380
Because it's Julie's wedding
and she thinks
it would be fun.

316
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,882
Does it matter why?

317
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,517
How is Julie?

318
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:51,985
<i>Would you call her?</i>
<i>She thinks you've</i>
<i>turned to butter.</i>

319
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,254
You're awfully isolated
the way you live.

320
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,123

I'm surrounded.

a photo of the cutout.

In front of
the Luxor pyramid?

325

Nobody stays there.

You, too.

Okay.

I am just...
I'm thrilled that.

Everyone's back
under one roof.

353
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,391
Welcome home, boys.

354
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,159
I know there's been
a lot of whispering
about why we're here,

355
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:17,598
So let me jump right in.
Retailers are down 20%.

356
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,100
Auto industry
is in the dump.

357
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,502
Housing market
doesn't have
a heartbeat.

358
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,872
It is one of
the worst times on record
for America.

359
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,844
This is our moment.

360
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,081
Now, last Summer,
we received a dynamite
young woman here.

361
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,882
From Cornell,

362
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,419
And she had some
pretty big ideas that
she challenged me with.

363
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,022
And my first reaction was,
"Who does this kid
think that she is?"

364
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,390
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out.

365
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,328
So, with a peek
into our future,
Natalie Keener.

If there's one word I want
to leave you with today,
it's this.

Our global

23 people on the road

Mr. Laskin, the reason
we're having
this conversation.

387
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,728
Is your position is
no longer available.

<i>I don't understand.

"you've been let go"
is never easy.

390
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,968
Change is always scary,
but consider the following.

391
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:04,337
Anybody who ever
built an empire
or changed the world.

they sat there that

step of a process.

if she can fire somebody?

450

She's fired Ned.

451

Fire me.

no longer available.

Hmm.

My name is Miss Keener.

I'm here today to

459
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,440
The only one
who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

460
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,109
Mr. Gregory hired me
to handle this for him.

461
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,843
Handle what?
Handle me?

462
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,480
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one

463

I'm gonna
go talk to him.

464
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,050
Mr. Bingham.
No, no, no.
You can't follow me.

465

remember?

466
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,187

All right.
Let's try this again.

467
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:52,622
Fire me again.
I just did.

468
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:54,324
Actually, you didn't.
Fire me.

472
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,865

Yes, you're fired.

473
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:03,933
Never say fired.

This is a
mythical situation.

477
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:08,938
How could I
possibly know why?

478
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,274
Why doesn't matter.
You never know why.

479
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:12,775
It's important not
to focus on the why.

480
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:15,145
And rather to
spend your energy
thinking about your future.

481
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,746
Well, I'm gonna
spend my energy.

482

On suing you
unless you give me.

483
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:19,782
A good reason why
you're firing me.
Mr. Bingham,

484
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,451
The reason's
not important.

485
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,919
So, you're firing me
without grounds?
Now I really have a lawsuit.

486
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,555
I get what you're
trying to say, Ryan.

487
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,323
Don't take
this personally,
Mr. Bingham.

488
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:28,525
Personally?

489
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,160
This is the most
personal situation.

490
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,927
That you are
ever gonna enter,

491
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:34,664
So before you try
to revolutionize
my business,

492
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:38,134
I'd like to know
that you actually
know my business.

493
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:51,598
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

that by doing this.

No, frankly,

00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:54,661
Well, I'm out of
Hartsfield into IAD,

597
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:57,563
With a connection
at ORD into SDF.

598
00:31:58,198 --> 00:31:59,365
<i>Sorry.</i>

599
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

600
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:03,736
How long's your layover?
They got multiples into SDF.

601
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:05,237
Think you could push?

602
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,574
Yeah, I can push.

603
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:24,757
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

604
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:28,928
And when I talk
about a strategy packet,
hand them one of those.

605
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,330
Sounds great.

606
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:34,233
So, although
I wish I were here
with better news,

607
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:36,869
The fact is that
you and I are
sitting here today.

608
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,806
Because this will
be your last week.

609
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:42,108
Of employment
at this company.

610
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:44,243
Why me?
What am I
supposed to do now?

611
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,913
Am I supposed to feel better
that I'm not
the only one losing my job?

612
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,748
This is ridiculous!

613
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:51,617
I have been
a fine employee
for over 10 years,

614
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:54,153
And this is
the way you treat me.

615
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:57,423
How do you sleep
at night, man? How?

616
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,259
How's your family?
They sleeping well
at night?

617
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:02,394
Electricity still on?

618
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,297
Heat still on?
Refrigerator
full of food?

619
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,567
Gas tank full of gas?

620
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:10,937
Going to chuck e. Cheese
this weekend or something?

621
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:13,106
Not me.

622
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:16,175
No, my kids,
we're not gonna
do anything.

623
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,882
What do you
suggest I tell them?

624
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:29,822
Perhaps you're
underestimating
the positive effect.

625
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,259
That your career transition
can have on your children.

626
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:35,194
The positive effect?

627
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,565
I make about
90 grand
a year now.

628
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:42,635
Unemployment is what,
250 bucks a week?

629
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:45,238
Is that one of
your positive effects?

630
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, we'll get
to be cozier,

631
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:48,841
Because I'm not gonna
be able to pay
my mortgage on my house.

632
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:50,409
So, maybe we can move
into a nice fucking.

633
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:52,845
One-bedroom
apartment somewhere.

634
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:55,948
And I guess
without benefits,

635
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,317
I'll be able to hold
my daughter as she,

636
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:00,653
You know,
suffers from her asthma.

637
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,956
That I won't
be able to afford
the medication for.

638
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:06,159
<font color="#808080">( Clears throat )</font>
Well, tests have
shown that.

639
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:07,559
Children under
moderate trauma.

640
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:10,963
Have a tendency to apply
themselves academically.

641
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,900
As a method of coping.

642
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,103
Go fuck yourself.

643
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:20,472
That's what
my kids'll think.

644
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,475
Your children's admiration
is important to you?

645
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:27,346
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

646
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,249
Well, I doubt they ever
admired you, Bob.

647
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:33,953
Hey, asshole,
aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

648
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,889
I'm not a shrink, Bob.
I'm a wake-up call.

649
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,657
You know why
kids love athletes?

650
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:40,759
I don't know.
Because they
screw lingerie models?

651
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,394
No, that's why
we love athletes.

652
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:46,299
Kids love athletes
because they
follow their dreams.

653
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,736
Well, I can't dunk.

654
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,972
No, but you can cook.

655
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,606
What are you
talking about?

656
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:59,378
Your resume says
that you minored
in French culinary arts.

657
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,948
Most students,
they work on
the fryer at KFC,

658
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:05,251
But you bussed
tables at Il Picador
to support yourself.

659
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,119
And then you
get out of college.

660
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:08,921
And you come
and you work here.

661
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:12,658
How much did
they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

662
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,493
27 grand a year.

663
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,528
And when were
you going to stop.

664
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:19,598
And come back
and do what
makes you happy?

665
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,202
Good question.

666
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,505
I see guys who work
at the same company
for their entire lives,

667
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:28,507
Guys exactly like you.

668
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,609
They clock in,
they clock out,

669
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:33,612
And they never have
a moment of happiness.

670
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:37,917
You have
an opportunity
here, Bob.

671
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:41,354
This is a rebirth.

672
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:44,390
Now, if not for you,
do it for your children.

673
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:16,088
He just waltzes in
and cuts in line?

674

as many Miles
as I can.

681
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,145
Okay, you got to
fill me in
on the Miles thing.

682
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:40,579
What is that about?

683
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:44,116
Are you talking about,
like, frequent flyer Miles?

684
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:45,684
You really
want to know?

685
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,820
I'm dying to know.

686
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:49,588
I don't spend a nickel
if I can help it.

687
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:52,758
Unless it somehow profits
my mileage account.

688
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:55,561
So,
what are you saving up for,
Hawaii, south of France?

689
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:58,630
It's not like that.
The Miles are the goal.

690
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,400
That's it?

691
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:03,102
You're saving
just to save?

692
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,536
Let's just say
that I have
a number in mind.

693
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:05,871
And I haven't
hit it yet.

694
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,207
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

695
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:10,676
I'd rather not.

696
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:13,446
Is it a secret target?

697
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:17,683
It's 10 million Miles.

698
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,885
Okay.
Isn't 10 million
just a number?

699
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:20,987
Pi's just a number.

700
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:23,589
Well, we all need a hobby.

701
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:26,725
No, I...
I don't mean to
belittle your collection.

702
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:28,760

It sounds cool.

703
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:30,396
I'd be the seventh
person to do it.

704
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,564

walked on the Moon.

Do they throw you a parade?

706
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:36,602
You get lifetime
executive status.

707
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:38,037
You get to meet
the chief pilot,

708

Wow.

709
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:40,906
And they put your name
on the side of a plane.

710
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:42,875
Men get such hard-ons
from putting
their name on stuff.

711
00:37:42,942 --> 00:37:45,144
You guys don't grow up.
It's like you need
to pee on everything.

712
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:46,778
Now who's stereotyping?

713
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:50,616
Fear of mortality.
It's like, "Yeah,
you're gonna die one day."

714
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:53,486
And why do you suppose
that's singular to men?

715
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:55,087
Probably because
you can't have babies.

716
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:56,688
The baby argument.

717

If I had that many Miles,

718
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:05,398
I would show up
at an airport,

just all go up to

Now you're talking.

909
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:21,773
He broke up with you
over text message?

910
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:25,143
It's kind of
like firing someone
over the internet.

911
00:49:26,946 --> 00:49:28,180
What a weaselly prick.

912
00:49:28,247 --> 00:49:30,415
Yeah.
But what does
that make me?

913
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:31,616
Someone who
falls for a prick.

914
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:33,051
We all fall for them.

915
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,921
Pricks are spontaneous,
they're unpredictable,
and they're fun.

916
00:49:35,988 --> 00:49:39,324
And then we're surprised
when they turn out
to be pricks.

917
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:41,492
I followed him to Omaha.

918
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,461
You did?

919
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:44,796
I had a job waiting for me
in San Francisco.

920
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:47,398
When he got an offer
from Conagra.

921
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:51,002
He said we could
start a life together.

922
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:53,739
So, I followed him.

923
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,273
To Nebraska?

924
00:49:58,444 --> 00:50:00,578
I thought I'd be
engaged by now.

925
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,848
No offense.

926

That's all right.

927
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:10,321
When I was 16,
I thought by 23
I'd be married,

928
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:11,522
Maybe have a kid,

929
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,592
Corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

930
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,594
I was supposed to be driving
a grand Cherokee by now.

931
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:20,031
Yeah, life can
underwhelm you
that way.

932
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,001
I mean,
where did you think
you'd be by...

933
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:27,572
It doesn't
work that way.

934
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,574
At a certain point,
you stop
with the deadlines.

935
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:31,409
It can be a little
counterproductive.

936
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:33,478
I don't want to
say anything
that's anti-feminist.

937
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:36,915
I really appreciate
everything that your
generation did for me.

938
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:38,950
It was our pleasure.
Well done.

939

But sometimes
it feels like no matter
how much success I have,

940
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:45,090
It's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.

941

You really thought
this guy was the one?

942
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:50,328
I could have
made it work.

946

he drives a 4runner.

And the only thing
he loves more than me
is his golden lab.

Mr. Empty backpack.

1069
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:40,521
You know about
my backpack?
I googled you.

1070
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:41,856
You did?

1071
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,459
It's what us modern girls do
when we have a crush.

1072
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:47,328
Did it bother you?

1073
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:48,563
It depends.

1074
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,932
Is the bag empty
because you hate people.

1075
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:53,100
Or because
you hate the baggage
that they come along with?

1076
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:55,670
I don't hate people.
I'm not exactly a hermit.

1077
00:57:55,737 --> 00:58:00,575
You just don't want to be
tied down with the whole
responsibility thing?

1078
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:03,845
I don't know what
originally sparked
the backpack.

1079
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:07,281
Probably needed
to be alone.

1080

thinking that I needed
to empty the backpack.

Last night...

1098
01:00:09,504 --> 01:00:14,041
It was kind of out of hand,
and I said things...

1099
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:17,244
I'm not actually
sure of everything
that I said,

want you to think...

It was nice to
see you cut loose.

1103
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:25,319
So, did you
wake him up
or slip out?

1104
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:28,255
What?

1105

This morning.
Your new friend.

1106
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:31,726
Did you wake him up
for an awkward goodbye.

1107
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:34,561
Or did you just slip out
and make him
feel like a whore?

1108

What happened to Alex?

1111
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,041
She had to leave town early
to get to a meeting.

1112
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:49,176
That's too bad.
Where does she live?

Thinking of going
to see her?

1115

We don't really have
that kind of relationship.

Is that supposed
to be charming?

No, it's simply
a life choice.

Everyone just chipped in.

1347
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:45,979
What gave you the idea
to do something so...

1348
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,514
Substantial.

1349
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:51,250
Well, Jim has
a lot of our
nest egg invested.

1350
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:52,986
In this
real estate venture.

1351
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:55,889
Mmm-hmm. It's a real
estate investment.

1352
01:14:55,957 --> 01:14:58,925
It's exciting,
but we went over
our finances and...

1353
01:14:58,993 --> 01:15:00,927
A honeymoon just
kind of at this state
in the game.

1354
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:03,029
Just doesn't
really seem affordable.

1355
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:05,264
So, you know,
we just thought,

1356
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:08,935
"just because we can't
travel doesn't mean
we can't have pictures."

1357
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:10,470
No, I think
that's a fabulous idea.

1358
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:11,638
Yeah, it's
a good one.

1359
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:14,474
I mean,
the concept is
turnkey everything.

1360
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,076
Okay? You buy
a maintenance contract
when you get the home.

You know,
we'll whack your weeds,

1362
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:19,479
We'll change
your light bulbs.

1363
01:15:19,547 --> 01:15:20,947
Furniture,
you can bring your own.

of our beautiful packages.

a place to call our own.

and moving in together,

And having a kid
and then having
another kid.
