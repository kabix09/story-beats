1
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,806
All right, Earl.

2
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,689
Next. Come on, step right through.

3
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:51,775
Sir, I need you to take your belt off
and go back through.

4
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,195
-Good, Mick.
-Hello.

5
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,739
Mick! Mick, I was just calling you.

6
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:00,158
Hey, I was just calling you at the office.
I gotta talk to you.

7
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,744
-Come on, stick with me.
-How long are you gonna be here today?

8
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,830
Depends on when the judge calls my client.

9
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:07,749
See, what does it say about me
that I let you treat me like this, huh?

10
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,502
I'm giving you a big chance
to move up in the world and help me.

11
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:12,879
-My daughter's about to go to surgery.
-I've heard it all before, Val.

12
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,089
Come on, baby, talk to me.
What do you got?

13
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,508
Okay, I got something big for you.
This guy's gonna be the big money.

14
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,592
It's in Inglewood.

15
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:20,762
But the problem is that he goes up
before the judge at noon, okay?

16
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,097
-You listening to me?
-I'm listening.

17
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,849
So the client,
his mother and his mother's lawyer

18
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,767
comes to my office at 8:00 a.m.
in the morning...

19
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:28,395
-He's already got a lawyer?
-Just listen.

20
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,981
Listen, it's not criminal,
it's just real estate, okay?

21
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,816
And I made them so crazy about you

22
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:35,610
that now they want to put up
their Malibu beach house against a million.

23
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,362
-The bail's a million?
-Yeah.

24
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,865
-What did they book this guy for?
-I say it's a romantic tiff.

25
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,533
The cops are saying
he beat up the girl really bad.

26
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:44,035
They want assault with a deadly weapon,
throw in a GBI.

27
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,620
-Has the DA filed yet?
-Yes, he did.

28
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,039
See, I take care of my friends.
I even take care of you, bubba.

29
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,624
Inglewood by noon.

30
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,251
You could do it, man.
Go through some red lights,

31
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,420
-break the speed limit.
-Be honest with me, Val. Is this real?

32
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,796
Don't bullshit me. Is this gonna stick?

33
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,591
Of course it is. Would I lie to you?
And you're gonna take care of me, right?

34
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:01,303
Make them forget the beach house
and go for my bond.

35
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:04,222
-What's his name?
-Louis. Louis Roulet.

36
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:07,267
R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.

37
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,604
That's not how you spell the wheel,
but got it.

38
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,611
Roberto!

39
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:21,323
Do you mind checking that list,
seeing where my man Harold Casey is on it?

40
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,243
Don't go that low.

41
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:28,413
I got a case across town at noon
I gotta get to.

42
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,749
Do you mind just bringing him down?
I'll only be a second.

43
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:32,000
-Reynaldo.
-Pardon me?

44
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:38,840
My name's Reynaldo, not Roberto.
Us bailiffs all look alike, right?

45
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,426
-Your man white?
-Yeah, he's white.

46
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,764
- I got blacks down here right now.
-All right, listen, Reynaldo.

47
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,642
My bad on your name.
I took a wild-ass guess. I was wrong.

48
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:51,061
But I didn't forget you at Christmastime,
did 1?

49
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,313
Remember that jar of nuts
with the prize inside?

50
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,607
"Happy holidays. Your friend, Mick."

51
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,319
-I went through those pretty fast.
-All right, let's make it two this time.

52
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,531
Okay. I'll bring your body down,
but you better make it quick.

53
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:04,449
Gracias, Reynaldo.

54
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,618
Harold Casey. Yeah, bring him down.

55
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:12,958
Harold. You shouldn't be running
from your lawyer. It's bad form.

56
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:14,793
Now, you know what I want to talk about.

57
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,962
In a minute,
Judge Powell's gonna call us down.

58
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,922
He's gonna want to know
if we're ready for trial.

59
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,216
-We are.
-We are not. And you know why not.

60
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:24,219
Rule one, I get paid or I don't work.

61
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:28,223
-Don't worry, I got your money.
-Exactly. You got it, I don't.

62
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,350
It's coming. I talked to my boys.

63
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:34,479
Listen, Harold, I looked on the list
of people I trust. You're not on it.

64
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:40,193
The law says you can't just quit.
The judge won't let you. I looked it up.

65
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:43,113
Pay close attention.

66
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:47,409
Michael Haller for the defense, Your Honor.
If I may, I'd like to carry this over.

67
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,869
Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?

68
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:52,497
I'm having trouble locating a witness,
Your Honor, an indispensable witness.

69
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,748
A Mr. Green?

70
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,919
-How much time do you need?
-That's hard to say.

71
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:00,755
-Does the state object?
-No, Your Honor.

72
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,177
All right, I'm gonna hold this over
pending notification from counsel.

73
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:11,600
-That was some bullshit, man.
-Yeah. I expect to hear from you, Harold.

74
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:24,112
Inglewood, Earl.
Keep it on the surface streets.

75
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,882
Earl, headphones.

76
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,843
-This is Haller.
-And this is your office.

77
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:50,889
Actually, I'm in my office, Miss Lorna,
on my way to the courthouse in Inglewood.

78
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,725
Listen, jot down
to remind me to give Reynaldo,

79
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,811
the bailiff over in San Fernando,
200 bucks for Christmas, all right?

80
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:59,731
Got it.
Hey, did Val reach you about his customer?

81
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:03,985
Yeah. "I got something big for you, Mick."
Every time. Any other calls?

82
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,904
No, just some odds and ends.

83
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,323
A few DUlls.
I just quoted them the house number.

84
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,534
-Gloria Larson called from county lockup.
-She got popped again?

85
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:14,120
The usual with a complication,
cocaine possession.

86
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:18,500
-Her first appearance is right after lunch.
-Look, tell her I'll try.

87
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,548
So, I was thinking, boss, you know,
when you get your license back or whatnot,

88
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:31,054
maybe I can stay on, like,
a permanent thing or something, you know?

89
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:34,057
I got my license back
three months ago, Earl.

90
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:47,278
Hey, boss. Do you want me
to do something about that? 'Cause I can.

91
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,699
No, just keep doing what you're doing.

92
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,794
Boss.

93
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,089
All right. Pull over up here.

94
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,692
-Counselor.
-Eddie.

95
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,404
-How's it hanging?
-A little to the left, my man. How about you?

96
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,322
Not bad.

97
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,033
Your ride's a little messy.

98
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:37,579
Yeah, the maid doesn't come till Tuesday.
What can I do for you, big man?

99
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,330
Our boy Harold called from the pen,

100
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:42,000
said you're stalling his case
till you see some more green.

101
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,920
- I don't get paid, I don't work.
-We paid you. $5,000.

102
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,380
That's long gone, Eddie.

103
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:50,884
Look, I could tell you that half of it
went to an aerial-photo expert.

104
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,845
He's gonna blow the state's case
by showing that the DEA

105
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:57,599
violated the airspace over Harold's farm
by flying too low.

106
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:01,978
I could also tell you that I gotta fly that guy
in from New York City, get him to testify,

107
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,980
put him up in a hotel
and all that kind of stuff,

108
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:09,110
but you don't need to know that.
All you need to know is that we had a deal.

109
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:11,029
It's time to refill the tank.

110
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:14,699
-What, another five grand?
-Ten.

111
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,368
He wants to fly business,
wants a first-class hotel.

112
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,537
And we want Harold back on the farm.

113
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,706
He's our best farmer,
if you know what I mean.

114
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,584
I don't, and I don't want to.

115
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,880
Now, look, either pay me
or go with a public defender.

116
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,965
He won't know much about airspace, but...

117
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:43,603
-Ain't you gonna count it?
- I just did.

118
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:46,481
Keep that rubber on the road, Eddie.

119
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,984
Let's roll, Earl.

120
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,531
So, this expert flying in from New York,

121
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:56,116
do you want me
to pick him up at the airport?

122
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,160
-There's nobody coming in.
-What?

123
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:04,749
The best camera experts in the world
are right here in Hollywood.

124
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,084
Nice.

125
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,921
You know what?
You would've done all right on the streets.

126
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,841
Shit. Where do you think I am, Earl?

127
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,533
-Louis Roulet?
-Yes.

128
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm Michael Haller.

129
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:45,039
Mr. Haller, I called you
because I need someone.

130
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,541
This whole thing is a setup.

131
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:48,793
I made a mistake with that woman,
and she was setting me up.

132
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:50,795
Keep your voice down. Hear me?

133
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,549
Don't say anything about the case
until I get you out on bail.

134
00:10:55,717 --> 00:11:00,847
-I understand your family lawyer's in court.
-Yes. His name's Cecil Dobbs.

135
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,056
He's here somewhere.

136
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,519
I'll find him.
Tell me about yourself. How old are you?

137
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:07,687
Thirty-two.

138
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,356
Ties to the community?
Did you grow up here?

139
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,861
Yeah, Beverly Hills. I went to USC.
I work for my mother's business.

140
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,739
-How about your father?
-He died when I was two.

141
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:24,204
-How much did you make last year, Louis?
-My taxes said $600,000.

142
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,666
I want a lawyer, too. My name's Corliss,
two "S's". Do you got a card on you?

143
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,252
Listen, buddy,
they'll have a lawyer for you out there.

144
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:34,255
Right now I need you to back away
and give us a little space.

145
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,093
Can you do that, pal?

146
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,346
-I'm backing, boss.
-There we go.

147
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,097
Okay.

148
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:45,600
There we go. There we go.

149
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,687
Listen, they've put some
heavy charges on you, Louis.

150
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,856
The DA's probably going to ask for no bail.

151
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,485
-Wait, no bail?
-I said they're gonna ask for it.

152
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,195
When was the last time you were arrested?

153
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,363
Never.

154
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:02,033
-So, if I checked your record...
-You'd find parking tickets.

155
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:04,369
Are you gonna get me out of here?

156
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:06,454
I'm gonna try, Louis.

157
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:17,840
Are you the prosecutor
who used to have the Roulet case?

158
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:22,345
-Haller! Son of a bitch.
-Rules are rules.

159
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,474
I wanted this one. Okay, okay, I'll go quietly.

160
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:30,228
But after today's hearing,
if you don't object.

161
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:35,942
-It depends. Are you going for no bail?
-That won't change with the prosecutor.

162
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,152
Not after what your guy did.

163
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,780
-If he did it.
-Sure, if.

164
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:44,242
They only picked him up in her home
with blood all over him.

165
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,327
I love it when you get sarcastic.

166
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,456
Can I at least see the arrest report?

167
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,918
You get it from whomever takes over.
No favors on this one.

168
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,797
How's Hayley today?

169
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:03,303
-She's good.
-Good.

170
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:06,097
I'll pick her up the usual time on Saturday.

171
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,518
Because of the seriousness of the offense,
the financial resources of the accused,

172
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,228
the state requests no bail.

173
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:16,399
Your Honor, there's no way the state can
claim that my client is a flight risk. He's not.

174
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,610
With resources like this man has,
flight is always a risk.

175
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,487
-Are there any priors?
-No, Your Honor.

176
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:25,950
Then I'm going to reduce the risk of flight
by ordering him to wear a tracer anklet

177
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,077
and I'm going to set bail at $1 million.

178
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:31,581
-Judge, have you seen the photo?
-Miss McPherson, bail is set.

179
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:33,416
Thank you, Judge.

180
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,254
Mick. Feeling compelled to thank me
and speak well of me,

181
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:39,881
'cause this one's gonna be the money,
I'm telling you.

182
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:43,509
-We'll see, we'll see.
-There's his lawyer right there. Cecil Dobbs.

183
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,970
Hey, Mick, don't forget our deal.

184
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:49,640
A possibility, but...
He's here now. I'll talk to you later.

185
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:52,602
-Cecil Dobbs.
-Mr. Haller.

186
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:57,231
It's depressing to see the boy
caught up in that cattle call.

187
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:59,525
The boy?

188
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,986
I've represented the family for a long time.

189
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:05,239
Listen, my advice is,
let Val fix you up with a bond.

190
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,158
Then you take the boy home.

191
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:10,578
But we were thinking of putting up property,
Mrs. Windsor's beach house.

192
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,080
The mother's name is Windsor?

193
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:14,499
Her second husband's name.
He's dead now.

194
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,626
Assessing the house will take days.

195
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,504
Trust me, you don't want the boy in the clink
for even that long.

196
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:23,508
So tap Val, take Louis to your office.
I'll meet you there at 4:00.

197
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,929
Here, let me give you my business card.

198
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,765
Oh, boy.

199
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:34,852
Media? Yeah, they're already on us.

200
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:38,314
Mrs. Windsor is sensitive about the press,

201
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:41,692
but I guess there's not much
we can do about that.

202
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:45,863
Let me see. Say, bub, come here. Come here.

203
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,616
I saw you filming in there.
What's your name?

204
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:52,578
-The name's Rob Gillon. They call me Sticks.
-Sticks, you freelancing on this?

205
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:55,248
Yeah, your client's got profile.
I figure I'd sell it to local news.

206
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:56,916
-How much?
-How much what?

207
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,960
How much they pay you
for what you shot in there?

208
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,838
That depends. $700, $750.

209
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:05,758
Yeah? How about we take
it off your hands for $8007?

210
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:08,970
No? Too short?

211
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:12,473
-All right, let's make it a grand. Deal?
-It's yours.

212
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,641
Sold.

213
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:17,687
-I can expense this, right?
-Of course. Absolutely.

214
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,148
-Thank you, Sticks.
-Thank you.

215
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:23,860
You know, Mr. Haller,
you weren't my choice.

216
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:27,613
I'll bet I wasn't. A firm like yours
must have some heavy hitters on call.

217
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,782
We do. But Louis insisted.

218
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:35,955
Frankly, I've never heard of you,
but maybe I should have.

219
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:40,668
-Did you say I was Louis' choice?
-Yes. He'd read about a case you handled.

220
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:48,050
I'll need 100 grand up front, working off
$550 an hour. Another 100 if we go to trial,

221
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:51,679
more if we go past a week.
Appeals, we start over.

222
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:58,102
I take it none of that's a problem.

223
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,313
-No.
-See you at 4:00.

224
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:18,456
-Where we headed now?
-We're gonna go meet Sticks at Jim's.

225
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:20,666
That same spot? All right.

226
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,182
There he is.

227
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:40,895
There we go. Eight for me, two for you.
Thank you, Sticks.

228
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:43,564
Anytime. Hey, my tape.

229
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,764
-You don't look good, girl.
-Thanks.

230
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,685
Something new,

231
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:23,479
booked on possession of coke,
plus the usual.

232
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:25,565
I know, it was dumb.

233
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:29,026
This guy paid me with it,
and I had it on me when I went to the next.

234
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,779
-And the next was a cop.
-Yeah.

235
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:37,410
Look, can't you get me into one of those
rehab places that gets you straight?

236
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,455
We did a pretrial rehab last time.
The DA's never gonna go for it again.

237
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:43,916
You may have to do some jail time, Gloria.

238
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,294
-Mickey, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

239
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,462
Yes, you can.

240
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:50,506
Hey.

241
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,886
They have programs in jail, too.
Now, look, you've had a long run.

242
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,932
Maybe after this, you can get out of the life.

243
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:03,185
Yeah. Housewife of the year, that's me.

244
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:08,774
Maybe I can turn some tricks with the PTA.

245
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,776
It's not funny.

246
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,364
I'd like to see that. All right, give it to me.

247
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:19,285
All right, I did a guy at the Travel Inn
on Santa Monica.

248
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:21,412
The guy who paid you with coke
instead of money?

249
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:25,333
Yeah, and he had a shitload of coke in there.
I saw.

250
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,209
Do you know him?

251
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:30,963
No, he reached me through my Web site.
He was...

252
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,133
-He was Mexican or something.
-Did you screen him?

253
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,259
Don't I screen them all?

254
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:37,094
Okay, with what?
He had his driver's license?

255
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:39,889
No, his passport.

256
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,975
Damn, what was his name?

257
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,395
-His name was Hector.
-Hector what?

258
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,648
What's his last name? Think, Gloria, think.

259
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:52,610
Hector "Arrande" Moya
is what you get if you run a trace.

260
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,279
He's a fugitive from a grand jury
down in Florida.

261
00:18:55,363 --> 00:19:00,451
The DA wants him for drug trafficking.
And Leslie? They want him a lot.

262
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,996
-And your girl's looking to trade?
-She'll give you his hotel and room number.

263
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,375
-She'll also have to testify on the coke.
-No, location only.

264
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,798
Your guys take it from there. My investigator
says Hector hasn't checked out yet.

265
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,174
And in exchange?

266
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:18,844
You drop all charges.
All she does is a pretrial rehab.

267
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:22,556
The facility at USC Med would be nice.

268
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,602
Or I can take it to the Feds.
They'll cut this deal in a minute.

269
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:36,028
-All right, you fucking asshole.
-After you.

270
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:40,825
-You'd go head first?
-I'd give it a shot if I was gonna do it.

271
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,952
-Why?
-Style points.

272
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,871
You're so vain.
Nobody cares if you kill yourself.

273
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,498
It'd look cool.

274
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:51,043
What do you think the last thing
to go through your mind would be?

275
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:54,171
-Your asshole.
-Yeah.

276
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:57,216
-Mr. Haller.
-Louis, good morning.

277
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,511
-Thank you.
-It's just a start.

278
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:02,930
This is Frank Levin.
Frank's my investigator.

279
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,432
-Louis Roulet.
-Good to meet you.

280
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:06,267
We're in here.

281
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:10,146
- I got a...
-Tracer anklet.

282
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:13,899
A present from your friend Mr. Valenzuela,
by order of the court.

283
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,360
As if I'd go anyplace
before this thing's over.

284
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:18,279
-Gentlemen, welcome.
-Mr. Dobbs.

285
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:21,282
-Mr. Haller.
-Good to see you. This is Frank Levin.

286
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,368
Mr. Levin is my investigator.
His fees are in addition to mine.

287
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,120
Of course.

288
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:29,415
Gentlemen, this is Mary Windsor.
She's Louis' mother.

289
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,709
-Mr. Haller.
-Mrs. Windsor, pleasure to meet you.

290
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:32,835
How do you do?

291
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:35,379
I'm fine, thank you.
This is Frank Levin, my investigator.

292
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,964
How do you do?

293
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:44,597
The charges against my son are ridiculous,
and so is that woman.

294
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,557
Here's a check for you, Mr. Haller.

295
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:49,935
This is going to have to come
from your son, Mrs. Windsor.

296
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:52,396
You can give him the money,
he can write the check,

297
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,398
but it must come from him.

298
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:58,152
He's my client,
and that has to be clear from the start.

299
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:05,534
I can't thank you enough for being here.

300
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,788
Sincerely, it's good to know
that you're gonna be there.

301
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:12,333
-When we need you.
-But not now, is that it?

302
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,879
No, ma'am. The DA could make you testify
about what you hear.

303
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,340
Attorney privilege does not cover you.

304
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:24,428
I'll see you at home.

305
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:29,391
Mary, I'll call later.

306
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,561
-She's not used to being told what to do.
-I can believe that.

307
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,399
So, how fast can I go to trial?
I want this behind me.

308
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:41,278
Are you sure? You can stretch it out,
enjoy your freedom. Most clients choose...

309
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,364
Guilty clients, you mean.

310
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:48,285
Okay, then I insist
on going to trial right away.

311
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,830
Or perhaps it never goes to trial at all.

312
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:54,708
My firm can bring considerable influence
to bear.

313
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,086
Don't kid yourself, Cecil.

314
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,089
There's no way
the state's dropping these charges.

315
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:03,133
As a matter of fact,
they've already upped them

316
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:04,802
to improve their negotiating position.

317
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:09,515
There won't be any negotiating.
No plea bargain, no nothing.

318
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:13,435
I'm not going to jail for something
I didn't do. I'm innocent.

319
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,773
And if there is a trial, I want to take
the stand and tell the jury that I'm innocent.

320
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,318
Now, if that's a problem,
we can part company right now.

321
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,532
Time to tell me what happened.

322
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:28,534
I was having a drink at the Association.

323
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:29,743
The Association?

324
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:32,955
That's the bar on 6th Street,
the one with a lot of young women?

325
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:36,667
Right. It's good for pick-ups.

326
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,086
What's the file say about the girl, Frank?

327
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,923
Regina Campo, known as "Reggie".

328
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:46,302
Twenty-six years old, part-time actress,
part-time office temp.

329
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,179
And hoping to retire after suing my client.

330
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,849
-Did you know her before last night, Louis?
-No.

331
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:54,351
I'd seen her around, but we'd never spoke.

332
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,939
She was always with another guy.
Last night, too.

333
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:01,692
I got it that she wasn't too into her date.

334
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,698
She brushed by me
on her way to the bathroom.

335
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:10,576
I hope I see you tonight.

336
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,120
And she basically
Just laid her address on me.

337
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:15,789
On a napkin.
She said she could get rid of him by 10:00.

338
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,708
Do you still have it? What she wrote down?

339
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,793
No. I didn't keep the napkin.

340
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,588
Frank, check that file.
See if the police report has any of this.

341
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:26,508
Frank here has already worked us
a little miracle.

342
00:23:26,592 --> 00:23:30,220
He happened to score us a copy
of the discovery file.

343
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,348
Everything the DA has.

344
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:35,309
They would have had to turn it over
eventually, but it would have taken awhile.

345
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:38,854
No, they don't have the other guy.
They don't even have the bar.

346
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:43,108
So, what, all they've got
is Louis shows up at her apartment

347
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:46,612
-and she gets beaten?
-That is such bullshit!

348
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:48,697
Just keep telling me your story.

349
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:55,454
Okay. I got there early
and waited until he came out.

350
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:11,220
-Did you see what he was driving?
-A blue Mustang.

351
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,782
All right, so he comes out, you go in.

352
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:35,202
She saw it was me and opened the door.

353
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,039
The hallway was tight,

354
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:43,002
so I had to walk past her
so she could close the door.

355
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:46,338
So my back was to her,

356
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:49,967
-and that was it.
-What was it?

357
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,468
She hit me with something.

358
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:55,973
I went down, and everything got black fast.

359
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:00,436
-Show me where she hit you.
-Like, right here.

360
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:04,690
It still hurts.

361
00:25:05,774 --> 00:25:07,693
And that blow knocked you out.

362
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,406
Just keep him down!
Can someone get the police?

363
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:15,325
Next I know, two fags are sitting on me
holding me down.

364
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:17,202
Police report has it.

365
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:21,957
-"Homosexual couple from across the hall."
-Like I said, faggots.

366
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,252
I stand corrected.
"Faggot couple from across the hall."

367
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:30,507
-Go on, Louis.
-I was still foggy when the cops came.

368
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:34,136
Ma'am, my name is Officer Maxwell.
I just need to ask you a few questions.

369
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,680
-Can you tell me your full name, please?
-Reggie Campo.

370
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:38,182
Do you know this gentleman?
Have you met him before?

371
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:40,601
-No.
-And that's when I saw she'd set me up.

372
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:44,521
-Set it up how?
-She put blood on my hand. My left hand.

373
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:47,858
He said he was gonna rape me. And kill me.

374
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:49,985
And then he said
he was gonna come back here

375
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:51,695
and rape me again.

376
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,365
You said she left the door open a crack.
Did you happen to see her face?

377
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:58,368
Not all of it. Mainly her eye.

378
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:02,748
-Wait, her left eye?
-Yes.

379
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:07,669
All right, so she already had the injuries
to the right side of her face.

380
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:13,759
She opens the door, conceals that from him,
and as he enters, she clobbers him.

381
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:18,430
So, our case is, what, she beat herself up?

382
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:23,560
If she already had the injuries, she either
did just that or she had her boyfriend do it.

383
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:27,773
Yeah, she must have.
I mean, she saw Louis' Maserati, his watch.

384
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,400
It's known the family has money.

385
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:34,279
I'll wager she'll be filing in civil court
the moment this is over.

386
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:36,615
Let's hear the police report.
How's Reggie tell it?

387
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:41,411
Okay. "According to the victim,
she was at home alone

388
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:44,790
"when the suspect presented himself
at the door as someone she knew.

389
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:47,835
"Upon letting him in,
she was immediately struck.”

390
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,586
Does it say he knocked her down?

391
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:56,051
Yes. "There was a struggle that continued
from the hallway to the stairs."

392
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,429
Come back here!

393
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:08,480
"He held the victim by the neck
and forced her down.

394
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:12,901
"The suspect maintained a position
behind her, holding a knife

395
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:15,195
"against the left side of her throat."

396
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:19,241
-That's not my knife.
-Are his prints on here, Frank?

397
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:23,162
Well, it stands to reason, if she put blood
on his hand, she put his prints on the knife.

398
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:26,540
- I just told you, though, that isn't my knife.
-Keep talking, Frank.

399
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:28,959
"As Miss Campo ran for the stairs,
they fought,

400
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,128
"and she kicked the intruder backwards.

401
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:33,630
"Realizing her attacker had her cornered,
she fought free

402
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,884
"and seized a nearby bottle of vodka."

403
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,428
-And that's when she clonked him.
-That's her story.

404
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:42,514
Those are all lies.

405
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:44,516
Look, if everything she's saying is a lie,

406
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,019
then this is going to be
the easiest case ever.

407
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:51,064
But you swear it's all lies? All of it?

408
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:56,737
Are you sure there's not anything
that you're not telling me?

409
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,530
Nothing.

410
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,451
Why'd he choose you, Mick?

411
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:06,496
Rich kid, spoiled as shit,
never heard the word "no."

412
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,125
Yeah, but the damn thing
is the way he tells the story, Frank.

413
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:12,336
It's just quirky enough to be true.

414
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,464
I don't know, Mick.
This kid feels wrong to me.

415
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:18,383
-But I'll check out his story.
-All of it.

416
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,762
You know the moves.
Start at the Association bar.

417
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,889
And then Miss Regina Campo.

418
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:27,100
The way he said she came on to him,
sounds like a pro.

419
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:30,771
Yeah, run it down. Also, Mr. Mustang.

420
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:33,023
All right, now,
I still don't get how that works.

421
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:35,776
What, he and Reggie got into some
rough trade and then he punched her?

422
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,319
Unless he was in on it.

423
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,281
-Meaning he hit her afterwards?
-Bingo.

424
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:45,827
Jesus, Mick,
are you starting to think Louis is innocent?

425
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:48,038
He just might.

426
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,083
Besides, you know what my father
always said about an innocent client?

427
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,043
No, I've never heard this. Hi.

428
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:56,046
He said, "There's no client as scary
as an innocent man."

429
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:59,174
That's right. Because if you screw up
and he goes to prison,

430
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:01,343
you're never gonna be able
to live with yourself.

431
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:06,807
So there's only one verdict you can put
on the board, baby, and that's an NG.

432
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,976
What do you say, Mags?

433
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,396
Frank, if you let a man drive home
in this condition,

434
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:15,983
I think that I can charge you both.

435
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:19,194
-I'll take him to his house.
-How you gonna get home?

436
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,324
Earl can pick up the car from me
in the morning. I came with friends.

437
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:31,331
-Later.
-Thank you, baby.

438
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,003
No, no, I got this. I insist.

439
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:03,238
What?

440
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:07,075
Moonlight becomes you.

441
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,248
You're not doing me any good, Haller.

442
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,261
Hey, Mick!

443
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:33,935
-Jesus, Frank, what couldn't wait?
-Want to watch a movie?

444
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:36,772
We caught a break.

445
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:41,360
The owner had a camera system
set up last month.

446
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:47,032
I had the security tape transferred to a disk
so I could manipulate.

447
00:30:47,115 --> 00:30:51,703
I know this place.
All right, and there's our boy Louis.

448
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:54,498
And I would like you to meet
Miss Reggie Campo.

449
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:57,918
-And there's Mr. Mustang.
-Are you sure?

450
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,754
I wouldn't have popped a grand for the tape
if I wasn't sure.

451
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:04,299
Now, watch.
Reggie gets up, goes to the ladies' room.

452
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:07,552
Mr. Mustang chats up the bartender,
so that's where he goes.

453
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:12,140
-That gives Reggie her chance. Watch her.
-Wait, that's not how he said it went down.

454
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:15,227
He said she gave him her address
on a napkin.

455
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,938
Okay, hold on, hoss, hold on.
Let her go pee.

456
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:22,401
Okay, here she comes. There's your napkin.

457
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:24,694
Now, watch this.

458
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:28,323
She and Mr. Mustang
decide it's time to split. Look, look.

459
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:32,577
-Look at his hand. Look at his watch.
-It's on his left hand. That's no good.

460
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,831
The facial blows are from the left.
This guy's right-handed.

461
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:39,835
Babe, you haven't been drinking enough.
You said you knew the Association.

462
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:43,880
You would realize this shot
is into the mirror behind the bar.

463
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:47,217
That's where the owner set up the camera
so he could watch his register.

464
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,638
-So everything's backwards.
-And Mr. Mustang punches with his left.

465
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:55,183
-You proud of yourself, Frank?
-I really, really am.

466
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:59,646
But not just about this. That feeling I had
about Reggie, that she was selling it?

467
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:03,817
- I did a little bit of research. She's a hooker.
-You're telling me the cops don't have this?

468
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,653
How can they?
There's only one and it's not a copy.

469
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:08,113
Then make a copy.

470
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:11,867
-Why, you gonna give it to the prosecutor?
-Yeah, a new guy named Ted Minton.

471
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,119
He's gonna hand over the discovery file.

472
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:17,205
Poor bunny.
He's not gonna know what hit him.

473
00:32:17,622 --> 00:32:21,960
-How long till you think your man's back?
-Probably just a few more minutes.

474
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:23,545
-Mr. Haller?
-There he is.

475
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:25,422
Sorry to keep you waiting.

476
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:29,676
-The discovery file.
- I hope this will be worth your while.

477
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,347
It's kind of light.
You got somewhere we can play this?

478
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:47,527
What else do you have?

479
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:49,488
What else do I have?

480
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:54,201
Come on, Minton,
let's cut the bullshit here, all right?

481
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:57,245
Look, not only is your so-called victim
a prostitute,

482
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,873
but I have her soliciting my guy on video.

483
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,793
You think a jury's gonna see this
and think he had to rape her at knifepoint

484
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:08,715
just to have sex with her? No.
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

485
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,219
Yes, and it doesn't change the offer
I'm prepared to make.

486
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:14,888
Offer?

487
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:16,264
You're going forward?

488
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:20,018
We will drop down to assault with a deadly,
attempted sexual battery.

489
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:24,147
Guidelines put that at seven years.
Maybe he'll do four.

490
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,195
What am I missing here?

491
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,080
Yeah, you want it.

492
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,041
Hey, Frank.

493
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:47,504
-What's up?
-Look here.

494
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,339
These files look identical to me.

495
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:53,093
All right? There's something we're missing
and we're not seeing it.

496
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:57,514
Well, here's the discovery file I got
from my clerk in the DA's office.

497
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:01,268
And this is the one I got from Minton.
There's Reggie Campo.

498
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:04,271
Reggie. That's the door chain.

499
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:05,939
No, it's the same.

500
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:11,486
Here we go. Here we go, here we go.
Son of a bitch.

501
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,282
They switched out the files.
This is a different knife.

502
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:18,451
I've been taking care of this guy for 10 years,
and he set me up.

503
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:22,080
-Well, he's off the Christmas list.
-He's on the shit list.

504
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,836
-Good shot, E.
-Nice shot.

505
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,504
-Thank you.
-Very nice.

506
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:31,673
Looks a little short to me.

507
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:47,063
-You guys finish up. I'll see you later.
-You're closed out, anyway.

508
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,190
Louis.

509
00:34:49,274 --> 00:34:52,444
-So what happened? Did you see Minton?
-I saw him.

510
00:34:52,652 --> 00:34:54,237
We need to talk.

511
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,907
You lied to me, Louis.

512
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:02,829
You didn't tell me
you were paying Reggie Campo for sex.

513
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:05,415
Now, don't go looking surprised.

514
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:08,043
You could have easily told me that
in Cecil's office.

515
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:12,088
I didn't want my mother to find out.
Cecil tells her everything.

516
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:15,050
So, you decide to keep from me
the one thing

517
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:20,263
-that could have made this trial go away?
-Is that what Minton said? No more trial?

518
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:23,433
I said "could have."
If that had been the only lie you told me.

519
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,561
-What do you mean?
-Do you recognize that?

520
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:28,229
It's a picture of your knife,

521
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:30,440
the one you had on you
when you went to Reggie's.

522
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:34,444
The one the cops have.
That's why Ted Minton didn't fold his tents,

523
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:37,447
and shit, why should he when he's got
a knife with her blood and your initials?

524
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,867
-That wasn't the knife that was in the file.
-That's right. It wasn't.

525
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,287
The file Frank got us
is what we call a loaded deck.

526
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:45,997
The cops used it to set us up,

527
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:48,166
to make us think they didn't have anything,
when, in fact,

528
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:52,087
they've got enough to put your
golf-playing ass away for 20 years, big boy.

529
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:58,551
Why'd you lie about the knife?
Christ, why would you lie about anything?

530
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:02,472
Everything you tell me is confidential,
attorney-client privilege.

531
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:06,351
All right, I didn't lie.
I said the knife in the picture wasn't mine.

532
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:11,648
- I said it twice and nobody listened to me.
-What are you now, the goddamn lawyer?

533
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:13,316
You said it wasn't yours?

534
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,278
What you should have said was,
"I had a knife, Mick, but this isn't it."

535
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:20,699
You brought a weapon
to a meeting with a prostitute.

536
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:25,245
You tell me, how the hell am I supposed
to make that look like she set you up?

537
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:31,376
I did not do this!

538
00:36:32,669 --> 00:36:35,422
It's custom-made, serrated tip.

539
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:41,511
-It has your initials engraved on the handle.
-I always carry it.

540
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:44,264
We show homes to people we don't know.

541
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:52,313
This one time,
my mother was showing a place.

542
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:55,942
It was in Bel-Air,
so she thought it was okay to go alone.

543
00:36:57,193 --> 00:36:59,904
-But he was there.
-Who was there?

544
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,326
The man who raped her.

545
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,873
When she didn't come back,
I went to the house and found her.

546
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:14,878
That's when she stopped showing property,
and I started carrying a knife.

547
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:15,962
Always.

548
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:20,049
-Your mother will have to testify.
-No, I don't want that.

549
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,052
I don't give a damn what you want.

550
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:27,307
If you want to stay out of the shithouse,
you do exactly as I tell you from now on.

551
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,767
You got it?

552
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,424
-Hey.
-Hey.

553
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:04,344
Success. We had fun.

554
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:09,516
-Got her?
-Yeah.

555
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:19,025
-At least we did one thing right, huh?
-We did a couple. Good night.

556
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:35,542
-Well, look who's come calling.
-Detective Kurlen.

557
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:39,003
Have you been to San Quentin lately?
See our boy Martinez?

558
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:43,842
I asked you something.
How's Martinez doing up there?

559
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,969
He make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me team?

560
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:48,888
-I haven't talked to him.
-Right.

561
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:52,183
I guess once they plead guilty and go down,
you don't have much use for them, huh?

562
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:59,315
But he's away forever, right?

563
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:03,194
-He got life, yeah.
-So, he'll be out in 15. Too bad.

564
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:06,990
Because his victim, Donna Renteria,
she's dead forever.

565
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:14,205
How does someone like you sleep at night,
with all the scum you represent?

566
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:24,007
Sorry.

567
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,221
Hey, Kurlen. Come here a second.

568
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,104
I had a client once,
he decapitated his ex-wife.

569
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:41,441
Kept her head in the refrigerator.

570
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:43,860
Nice. Sweet.

571
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:48,740
The DA got greedy,
tried to pile on two unsolved murders,

572
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,534
trick up the evidence
to make it look like my guy did it.

573
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:55,371
But you got your boy off.
And he's out walking around now, right?

574
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:58,249
-Well, fuck you, Haller.
-No, fuck the DA,

575
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:02,670
and the cops who helped him.
It's called the justice system, Kurlen.

576
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:05,548
That's not the way it's supposed to work.

577
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:16,392
Ernie and Rich.

578
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:18,311
-How are you?
-Monica.

579
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:23,566
-Well, look who's here.
-Hello, kids. Maggie.

580
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,902
Hey, hey, Haller. Do you want a beer?

581
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,862
-I'd love a cold beer. Scotty.
-Yeah, Mick.

582
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:29,656
-We can share this.
-No, I'm good.

583
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,825
Why, why? We've swapped spit before.

584
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:42,502
-Tell me about your buddy Minton.
-Who says he's my buddy?

585
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:46,965
-He sandbagged me but good.
-With that guy Corliss, right?

586
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,926
Yeah. How'd you know?

587
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,887
-You'll take the guy's head off on the stand.
- I hope so.

588
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:56,015
So, what, Ted talked to you about Corliss?

589
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,351
No, no, I sent him to Ted.

590
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:02,689
He thought I was on the case
because I made first appearance.

591
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:07,110
-But I should not be telling you any of this.
-No, I knew.

592
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:11,572
Look, I knew a guy like Minton wasn't above
putting a jailhouse snitch on the stand.

593
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,409
And that's what he is, right?

594
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:19,872
Can we just have a friendly beer
and not talk about work, please?

595
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:24,627
Let's get a table out back,
grab something to eat.

596
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:29,382
-We can talk about our daughter.
-Okay. Yeah.

597
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:44,105
I bet you didn't know 3-D movies
could be so much fun.

598
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:46,149
The fun is watching her.

599
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,694
-Join the club.
-Right?

600
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:50,903
Yeah.

601
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:58,745
Hey, you didn't know Minton had Corliss
till I blabbed, did you?

602
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:01,748
I knew he was hiding something.

603
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:05,334
Screw it. I'm not going to defend Minton.
He fights too dirty.

604
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,336
This from Maggie McFierce?

605
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:12,008
You know there are lines I won't cross.

606
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:14,093
Don't you?

607
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,182
Can you give me a lift?

608
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,338
She's going to wake up
and she's going to see us here. It's not fair.

609
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:36,592
-How'd she get in here?
-She comes in when she has nightmares.

610
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:39,095
How often does she have nightmares?

611
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:47,687
Don't start. You don't know what it's like
to raise a child alone.

612
00:43:55,278 --> 00:43:58,823
I'll leave, come back in an hour,
we'll go together to pick up your car

613
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,449
and then I can take Hayley to school.

614
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:04,203
Just like that,
you're going to start taking her to school?

615
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:08,040
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

616
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:10,042
Yes, I remember
what we talked about last night,

617
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:14,213
but I thought you were just trying to get
my head into your case or get me in bed.

618
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:16,966
I can't win with you, can I?

619
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:19,302
No, you can't.
Not when you're being a defense lawyer.

620
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:21,596
Not when I'm trying
to keep dirtbags off the street

621
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,893
-and you keep putting them there.
-I've heard it all before, Mag.

622
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:58,007
Donna Renteria.

623
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:52,937
Man, they had my picture everywhere, man.

624
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,398
They were gonna bring me in anyways,
so I'm like, "Fuck."

625
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:58,651
Yeah, but you told Kurlen you were in
her apartment, all right? He didn't have that.

626
00:45:58,734 --> 00:45:59,819
-No, no...
-He didn't have it.

627
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:01,237
He didn't even have any prints.

628
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,324
No, but that shit I said was true.
I saw her at La Zona Rosa,

629
00:46:05,408 --> 00:46:07,910
and she said if I paid her more money
than the other guy,

630
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:09,578
then we can go to her place.

631
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:12,540
-Nobody saw any other guy.
-There was another guy!

632
00:46:12,623 --> 00:46:15,543
It was a white guy! He was right by the bar.

633
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:18,170
The coroner says her vagina
was brutalized.

634
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:20,715
-Are you my lawyer, man?
-I'm trying to be.

635
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,842
Look, when I left, that chick was fine.

636
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:26,429
Look, I slept with her, okay, I did,
but I didn't hurt her, I promise.

637
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:30,224
Three people saw you throw a knife
into the LA River. Help me.

638
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:33,144
I had that knife in my car.
I knew they were gonna find it, man.

639
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:34,603
They were gonna pin it on me, I know!

640
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:38,441
Look, if all you did was have sex with her,
then why didn't you leave any prints?

641
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:41,777
-I mean, the place was wiped down clean.
- I didn't wipe it down, though.

642
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:45,614
You left semen on the towel. Do you
remember that? Did you forget the towel?

643
00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:50,328
No! I didn't forget anything, man.
I just used that towel, I paid her, and I left.

644
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:53,706
-That defense isn't gonna make.
-Don't say that!

645
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:57,293
It won't make, man. There's not a chance
in hell with that defense.

646
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:59,462
-You know what they're asking for?
-What?

647
00:47:00,713 --> 00:47:02,381
They want the death penalty, man.

648
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:05,593
They want to take your ass down.
They want to burn you, man.

649
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:06,677
Listen,

650
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:11,849
I can see to it that that never happens,
but not if we don't plead.

651
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:14,018
You want me to say I did it?

652
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:18,314
There's a deal to be made here,
and I can do it.

653
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:22,735
I can get you life.
Life means you're paroled in 15.

654
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:29,408
It keeps the needle out of your arm, man.
It's our only play, man.

655
00:47:29,492 --> 00:47:31,577
I'm innocent, bro.
Do you know what that means?

656
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:34,622
-That means I didn't do it!
-It's the best I can get for you, man.

657
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:37,458
I don't want to go to jail
for something I didn't do, man!

658
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,877
You know what that's gonna do
to my mom, bro?

659
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:45,257
I ain't going to jail
for something I didn't do, bro!

660
00:47:47,843 --> 00:47:49,553
Come on, man.

661
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,936
Please, help me, bro. Please, help me.

662
00:48:45,985 --> 00:48:48,904
I'm not gonna ask how you are,
'cause I know.

663
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:52,116
No, bro. You don't know.

664
00:48:53,826 --> 00:48:58,038
-I need to ask you some questions, Jesus.
-Questions?

665
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:01,709
Now?

666
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:05,588
You know what? You didn't ask me
a lot of questions back then.

667
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:10,509
-You never asked me, "Did you kill her?" No.
-Please.

668
00:49:12,178 --> 00:49:14,472
I am trying to make this right.

669
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:19,143
I need you to tell me what happened
at the La Zona Rosa bar that night.

670
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:21,520
One more time.

671
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:22,897
Please.

672
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:29,361
She was working.

673
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:36,869
I liked her. Right off the bat, I liked her.
I knew she was the one.

674
00:49:37,536 --> 00:49:39,205
You know, she caught my eye.

675
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:46,462
They were going around in a little circle.
She was acting all cute and shit.

676
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:52,593
Listen, I don't know how this works.
I don't know...

677
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:56,013
-It's fine. You want a dance?
-Yeah, I want a dance.

678
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,640
I can give you a private dance.

679
00:49:57,723 --> 00:50:01,310
I picked her. I asked her to dance for me.

680
00:50:02,895 --> 00:50:07,066
Then we started talking. You know
what she said? I could take her home.

681
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:11,237
-So, how much for me to come over?
-Usually, I charge $1,000.

682
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,573
But for you, $300, 'cause you're sexy.

683
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:18,118
And she was good, man. Yeah, so I did.

684
00:50:18,202 --> 00:50:19,703
But I didn't kill her.

685
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,707
Okay, but you said
there was another guy, right?

686
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:26,001
Yeah. She was talking to him.

687
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:40,516
And then she came back to me.

688
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:41,725
Okay.

689
00:50:45,563 --> 00:50:49,024
I have some pictures, all right?
Some mug shots.

690
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:53,112
I want you to see if you can ID
that other guy at the club.

691
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:58,075
-Tell me if you recognize him.
-No.

692
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:02,037
How about this guy? Jesus?

693
00:51:04,123 --> 00:51:07,459
You recognize him? Okay, take your time.

694
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:15,050
Yeah, how about this guy?
Is this the other guy?

695
00:51:15,134 --> 00:51:17,928
-Was this guy in the club that night?
-Guard!

696
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:21,015
-Jesus? Is this the other guy?
-You know what?

697
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,434
You played me, bro.
Why are you bothering me with this?

698
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:26,687
-Jesus, is that the guy from the club?
-What does it matter, man? I'm right here.

699
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,398
-Right where you wanted me, bro!
-This is the guy.

700
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:32,443
-You know what? I don't trust you, dawg!
-I'm trying to make it right!

701
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,903
-And I never will!
-Interview's over!

702
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:39,408
Okay, Ahab. That's my boy. That's my boy.
Get out of here.

703
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,415
Hey. You okay? Where you been today?
I've been trying to call you.

704
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:49,752
I've been to San Quentin.

705
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,837
To see Jesus Martinez.

706
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:58,594
About what happened
after he left Donna Renteria's apartment.

707
00:51:58,677 --> 00:52:01,930
-After he killed her.
-He didn't kill her, Frank.

708
00:52:02,014 --> 00:52:06,018
He went there, had sex,
flushed the condom down the toilet,

709
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:08,604
wiped his prick on a pink towel,
and then he went home,

710
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:09,688
but he didn't kill her.

711
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:12,733
Come on, Mick,
we've been through this 100 times.

712
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:16,612
The real killer, she lets him in.

713
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:20,199
Maybe he fakes like he's Martinez
and he forgot something.

714
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:21,950
Maybe he had an appointment.

715
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:24,912
-Like the guy in the bar?
-Right.

716
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:28,791
He comes in.
He punches her a few times to soften her up.

717
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:31,251
But she's not gonna be lucky
like Reggie Campo is,

718
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:34,630
'cause this son of a bitch pulls a knife,
takes her and bends her over the table,

719
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:36,757
puts on a condom and rapes her,

720
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,802
and when he's done,
he stabs her over and over,

721
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:41,136
52 times,

722
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,140
while he works something out
in his sick goddamn mind.

723
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:47,559
Do I have to tell you
what kind of knife it was?

724
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:52,064
-A short-blade folding knife?
-Just like Roulet's.

725
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:55,567
Okay, okay,
let's take it a little bit easier on that, okay?

726
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:58,237
Why, Frank? Why didn't I listen?

727
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,989
Listen, I got a baseball bat
if you really want to beat yourself up.

728
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:04,576
No, I'm not beating myself up.
The son of a bitch told me he didn't do it.

729
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:08,330
All right? There was the DNA
and there was the knife that he ditched,

730
00:53:08,414 --> 00:53:10,499
but there was no way
I was gonna listen to him.

731
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:14,545
There was no way I would believe
that he didn't do it. I couldn't believe him!

732
00:53:14,837 --> 00:53:20,217
I couldn't believe that I actually
was representing an innocent man.

733
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,927
Just like my father warned me about.

734
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,847
Mick, come on. They all say they didn't do it.
You know that.

735
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,349
Yeah, so what do I do? I get him to plead.

736
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:31,520
I get his sister to beg him to plead.
"Cause he's got no case.

737
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,065
So I get him the best deal I can,
and I feel pretty goddamn good about I,

738
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:36,984
'cause, hey,
I got the son of a bitch off death row.

739
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:40,863
I got him 15 years
instead of the needle. Yeah.

740
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:54,001
I showed him Roulet's picture.

741
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:57,713
Okay.

742
00:53:57,796 --> 00:54:01,008
Roulet is using Martinez
as the other guy in the bar?

743
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:04,136
Like Mr. Mustang in this case?

744
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:07,306
So, he's not just getting off
on killing women.

745
00:54:07,473 --> 00:54:12,019
It's seeing somebody else do the time.
That's his MO.

746
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:14,730
-What did Martinez say?
-Enough.

747
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:18,734
Enough for me to know
I gotta find another way.

748
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:22,070
What you have to do is find a way
to put Roulet in Renteria's apartment

749
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:23,322
the night she was murdered.
That's what you...

750
00:54:23,405 --> 00:54:25,908
I have to find a way to make it right, Frank.
I gotta make it right.

751
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:30,662
Well, you can't bring it to the cops,
'cause he's your client.

752
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,332
And you can't take it to the DA,
'cause you'd lose your license.

753
00:54:33,415 --> 00:54:34,708
Worse.

754
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:40,589
Any evidence we found would
be inadmissible. Attorney-client privilege.

755
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:44,176
It would ruin any case
they could ever have against him.

756
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:49,515
That's why that son of a bitch hired me.

757
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,354
He's got me in his trick bag.

758
00:54:55,979 --> 00:55:00,108
You got one client in jail
for what your other client did.

759
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:07,157
What you gonna do, Mick?

760
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:43,902
Hey, Mick, you okay, buddy?

761
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:46,071
-Frank, Frank, listen to me. I got it.
-What?

762
00:55:46,154 --> 00:55:49,533
You know how Roulet said all we'd find
on him was parking tickets, right?

763
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:50,659
Right.

764
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:52,744
Listen, I don't buy that anymore.
No, there were others.

765
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:55,914
Other girls he did. Renteria and Campo.

766
00:55:55,998 --> 00:55:58,417
I mean, they look too much alike.
It's like they're sisters.

767
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,670
And the injuries to the right side
of their faces are too similar, man.

768
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:03,839
This guy's got a type, Frank.

769
00:56:03,922 --> 00:56:06,508
There's other cases out there,
and you can find them.

770
00:56:06,592 --> 00:56:10,262
-You gotta do this. I can't. I'm his lawyer.
-Okay. Okay, I'm on it.

771
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:13,682
All right, I gotta take this. Maggie, hey.

772
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:15,517
Hey, did you get my voicemail?

773
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:18,979
I've been up to San Quentin
to see an old client. How's Hayley?

774
00:56:19,104 --> 00:56:22,524
She's good.
You know, she has soccer this weekend.

775
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:24,943
Saturday, right?

776
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:28,113
-I look forward to it.
-Great, we'll talk later.

777
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:06,568
If you're wondering how I got in,
I'm in real estate,

778
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:10,822
-so if I want to get into a friend's house...
-No, we're not friends.

779
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:13,450
You're my client.

780
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:17,371
-I'm your lawyer.
-My lawyer.

781
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:21,458
See, that's exactly
what I wanted to remind you of.

782
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:26,672
I'm about to go on trial,
and yet I couldn't reach you.

783
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:32,386
Now I find out where you were all day.
Heard you tell Maggie.

784
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:36,598
-You shit.
-You went to see Jesus Martinez.

785
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:40,519
And I know what you talked about.

786
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:42,396
Donna Renteria.

787
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:45,190
You're right, Mick.

788
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,860
I killed her.

789
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:54,491
There. No reason I shouldn't tell
my own lawyer, since it's all confidential.

790
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:59,454
Attorney-client privilege.
Isn't that what you told me?

791
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:04,376
It's time for you to go, Louis.

792
00:58:07,004 --> 00:58:09,339
All right.

793
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:21,643
That's a cute picture
of your daughter Hayley.

794
00:58:21,727 --> 00:58:25,605
She's very pretty.
She's got soccer practice tomorrow, right?

795
00:58:25,689 --> 00:58:26,857
Don't.

796
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:29,693
Don't what?

797
00:58:30,068 --> 00:58:33,905
You think you're the first client
to ever threaten me or my family?

798
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:36,116
All I said was she's pretty.

799
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,370
Are you scared, Louis?

800
00:58:41,246 --> 00:58:43,582
"Cause where you are right now,

801
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:48,587
you're in a very dangerous place.

802
00:59:10,942 --> 00:59:14,696
And so, in conclusion,
what this case is about,

803
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:19,993
what this case is all about, is a predator.

804
00:59:20,077 --> 00:59:24,956
On that night of March 6th,
Louis Roulet was out stalking his prey.

805
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:28,543
Now, you are gonna hear
from the victim herself about her lifestyle,

806
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:31,588
one that we would not condone.

807
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:35,217
But remember, anyone,

808
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,470
anyone can be the victim of a violent crime.

809
00:59:39,137 --> 00:59:43,308
This case is clear. It's straightforward.

810
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:49,147
A man attacked a woman in her home
in order to rape and kill her,

811
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:54,402
and it is only by the grace of God
that she's here to tell her story.

812
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:55,487
Ladies and gentlemen,

813
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,366
my name is Michael Haller,
and I'm representing Louis Roulet.

814
01:00:01,618 --> 01:00:06,498
Now, Mr. Minton doesn't want
to use the word "prostitute"

815
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:10,544
for the woman
who is supposed to be Louis' victim.

816
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:13,213
He needn't worry,

817
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:17,384
'cause this case isn't about
how she makes her money.

818
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,761
This case is about her actions.

819
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,765
How she saw a young man
with signs of wealth

820
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:27,853
as a ticket out of the life she was in,
and chose to target him.

821
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,109
Now what she didn't count on was you.

822
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:39,114
How you'd put two and two together
and let your common sense tell you

823
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:41,700
who the real predator is in this case.

824
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:46,538
Thank you for your time.

825
01:00:46,621 --> 01:00:50,167
Court will adjourn until Monday,
when the state will call its first witness.

826
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:54,963
-Go, Hayley, go! Turn it, turn it, turn it! Go!
-Nice, baby, nice shot!

827
01:00:55,046 --> 01:00:58,300
-Left foot! Left foot!
-Take it away, take it away!

828
01:00:58,383 --> 01:01:01,553
Go, Hayley! Stay on it!

829
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:04,097
Get on it.

830
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:05,348
Hey, Mick.

831
01:01:08,894 --> 01:01:10,312
Hey, Maggie.

832
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:13,398
-What are you doing here?
-I'm going to take Hayley home.

833
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:15,442
You've got some place to be.

834
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:18,904
What are you talking about?
What happened?

835
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:33,418
-Hey, hey, sir, stop, please.
-Ma'am, I'm family, okay? I'm family.

836
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:45,597
-This is a closed crime scene.
-Sir, the name's Mick Haller... Sobel!

837
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,433
-Sobel!
-Yeah, but, listen, slow down a second.

838
01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:49,768
-Slow down.
-Talk to me. What happened?

839
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,811
Somebody shot him
in the chest and the head,

840
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:56,858
and then they shot the dog, too.
His body is right in front of the door.

841
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,946
Great, this is just what we need.

842
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:20,215
Okay, so you've been here before.
You can tell us if anything is unusual.

843
01:02:21,132 --> 01:02:22,175
Anything weird?

844
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:27,222
Like, throughout this whole house,
why is it that all I see are pictures

845
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:29,015
of this guy?

846
01:02:31,268 --> 01:02:33,728
My partner's asking if Frank Levin was gay.

847
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:36,856
-Is that relevant?
-Yeah, it's all relevant.

848
01:02:37,232 --> 01:02:41,111
He was an ex-cop.
Crimes against persons, in Chicago.

849
01:02:41,194 --> 01:02:43,280
Is that butch enough for you, Lankford?

850
01:02:44,823 --> 01:02:48,326
- I don't see anything that can help you here.
-All right. Hey, Haller.

851
01:02:49,202 --> 01:02:53,665
I don't need to tell you to stick around town
where I can find you, do I?

852
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,208
Am I a suspect?

853
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:02,799
When do you retire, Lankford?

854
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:04,342
-When do I retire?
-Yeah.

855
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:06,928
Eighteen months. Why?

856
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:11,266
I want to make sure I show up
the next morning so I can kick your ass.

857
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:56,061
Val!

858
01:04:00,648 --> 01:04:01,649
Hey, Mick!

859
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:04,986
What the hell are you banging on the door
like that for, man? Are you nuts?

860
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:09,491
-Dude, dude, you look terrible.
-Frank Levin was murdered.

861
01:04:09,574 --> 01:04:13,661
-Man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that.
-Roulet did it.

862
01:04:13,745 --> 01:04:15,955
Roulet? I thought you and Frank
were defending him.

863
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:18,249
Why would he take Frank out?
That makes no sense.

864
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,088
You know, Val, I figure
you know exactly how it went down.

865
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:24,881
How do I know about it?
What are you talking about?

866
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:28,593
"Cause you lied to me.
You didn't send me the Roulet case.

867
01:04:28,676 --> 01:04:31,554
-He asked for me.
-Okay, okay, that's true, man. That's true.

868
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:33,848
But you know what?
I said, "Haller's your man. Go for Haller."

869
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:37,185
- I did that for you.
-You lied to me once.

870
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:39,813
So, what, you think I'm gonna lie
about this? Give me a little respect.

871
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:42,190
Give me a little credit.
I'm not gonna lie about this kind of shit.

872
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:44,526
The police tracked the tracer
that you put on Roulet.

873
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:47,237
-It said he was nowhere near Frank's house.
-So maybe it wasn't him, Mick.

874
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,656
So maybe it wasn't him.
Nobody can beat the tracer, huh?

875
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:53,743
-It was him. Roulet killed Frank, Val.
- I don't like the way you're following me.

876
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:55,078
I don't like the way
you're cornering me, man.

877
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:58,039
- I don't like the way you're talking to me.
-Roulet killed Frank, Val.

878
01:04:58,123 --> 01:05:00,208
Do you think I cut the kid loose
so he could murder Frank?

879
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:01,584
Did Roulet kill Frank?

880
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:04,045
Mick, I'm sorry about Frank,
but I didn't do it, man.

881
01:05:04,129 --> 01:05:08,299
You're the only one
that could've taken it off him.

882
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:49,799
Being married to you sucked,
but it beat being your car service.

883
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:56,264
-Maggie.
-Yeah?

884
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:59,601
You know what I used
to be afraid of, Maggie?

885
01:05:59,684 --> 01:06:03,688
-Yeah. Me.
-That I wouldn't recognize innocence.

886
01:06:05,523 --> 01:06:08,651
That it would be right there in front of me
and I just wouldn't see it.

887
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:11,070
Yeah.

888
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:13,114
I'm not talking about

889
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:17,535
guilty or not guilty,
just innocence, you know?

890
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:21,706
You know what I'm afraid of now?

891
01:06:22,373 --> 01:06:23,500
Evil.

892
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,794
Pure evil.

893
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:31,508
Maggie.

894
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:34,177
Did I get Frank Levin killed?

895
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,554
Mickey, no.

896
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,562
Go to sleep, honey.

897
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:10,672
New message, yesterday, 11:07 a.m.

898
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:14,342
Mick, it's me. I tried you on your cell.
Sorry to interrupt your day with Hayley,

899
01:07:14,425 --> 01:07:16,844
but you asked me
to do some digging on Roulet.

900
01:07:16,928 --> 01:07:22,225
Well, I might have found Martinez's ticket,
Mick, his ticket out of Quentin.

901
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:26,646
Someone's at the door. Look, you go
and you have a good time with Hayley,

902
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:29,274
and I'll fill you in when I know it's for sure.
I gotta go.

903
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:39,951
-Detective Sobel.
-Sobel, Mick Haller here.

904
01:07:40,034 --> 01:07:41,828
Listen, I just checked my messages.

905
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:44,789
It turns out Frank called me
just before he was killed.

906
01:07:44,872 --> 01:07:48,209
The message came in at 11:07.
He said he found something,

907
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:50,962
something that could help
an old client of ours get out of prison.

908
01:07:51,045 --> 01:07:54,716
-Okay, who is the client?
-Jesus Martinez. He's in San Quentin.

909
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,595
-Okay, did he say anything else?
-Yeah, he made a joke. He said something

910
01:07:58,678 --> 01:08:01,139
about finding Martinez's ticket out of the Q,

911
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:04,142
and then someone came to the door.
That's when he hung up.

912
01:08:04,225 --> 01:08:06,978
All right, listen. Whoever came to the door,
that's who killed him.

913
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:09,689
-Okay, you get me a copy of the tape.
-I'll get it to you right away.

914
01:08:10,398 --> 01:08:12,025
How's it going on the case?
You getting somewhere?

915
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:14,068
Yeah. We did catch a break.

916
01:08:14,152 --> 01:08:16,487
We found a bullet casing
in the room from a .22.

917
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:19,699
That's good. Frank Levin owned a .22.
You'll find it registered to him.

918
01:08:19,782 --> 01:08:22,452
Yeah, we did.
Yeah, but it wasn't a Woodsman.

919
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:26,331
-A what?
-A Colt Woodsman. It's an old antique job.

920
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:28,875
That's the gun that killed him.

921
01:08:58,363 --> 01:08:59,447
Fuck!

922
01:09:21,052 --> 01:09:22,553
Morning, Mick.

923
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,892
It's too bad about Frank Levin.
Got any idea who did it?

924
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:29,894
Yeah, I'm pretty certain I do.

925
01:09:35,233 --> 01:09:39,487
Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss Campo
on the night of March 6th.

926
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:43,658
Yep. We went on a date to the Association.

927
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:46,577
Then I took her back to her place
for another date.

928
01:09:46,744 --> 01:09:50,373
-And did you have sexual relations?
-About 400 bucks worth.

929
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,751
And she earned every single cent.

930
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:56,504
What time did you leave her apartment?

931
01:09:56,587 --> 01:09:59,507
I don't know.
About five minutes before 10:00.

932
01:09:59,716 --> 01:10:02,009
Did she say
whether she had another appointment?

933
01:10:02,385 --> 01:10:04,846
Oh, no, no.
She acted like she was done for the night.

934
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:06,013
Objection, Your Honor.

935
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:10,017
I don't think Mr. Talbot's qualified
to interpret Miss Campo's thinking or plans.

936
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:14,105
-I mean she acted satisfied.
-Sustained. Go on, Mr. Minton.

937
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:18,776
When you left, Mr. Talbot,
what condition was she in? Was she hurt?

938
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,862
No. She was fine.

939
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,073
She did not look like this?

940
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:28,661
Man, what kind of sick bastard
does something like that?

941
01:10:29,036 --> 01:10:30,621
Answer the question.

942
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:33,833
No.

943
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:37,211
No, we made pleasurable
and consensual love.

944
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:42,216
I mean, that's what life's all about, right?
Then I paid her.

945
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:46,637
Mr. Talbot,
are you right-handed or left-handed?

946
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:47,722
Left.

947
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:49,682
-Left?
-Yeah.

948
01:10:49,766 --> 01:10:52,560
Isn't it true that before you left
Miss Campo's apartment,

949
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:56,314
she asked you to repeatedly strike her
in the face with your left fist?

950
01:10:56,397 --> 01:11:00,067
Your Honor, Mr. Haller is just muddying
the waters with outrageous statements.

951
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:04,906
-It's part of the defense theory, Your Honor.
-The witness can answer.

952
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:07,492
I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?

953
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:12,997
This is by your hand, isn't it, Mr. Talbot?
Admit it. This whole thing is a setup

954
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,667
by you and Miss Campo,
framing my client, Louis Roulet, isn't it?

955
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:19,420
I never hit her or any other woman,
you understand?

956
01:11:19,504 --> 01:11:21,923
Do you know a prostitute
named Shaquille Barton?

957
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:27,804
-Work name is Shaquilla Shackles?
-Yeah, yeah, I seen her once.

958
01:11:28,095 --> 01:11:29,931
And if I brought her in here and she said,

959
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:34,936
"Yes, Mr. Talbot, he did strike me
with his left fist in my face."

960
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:39,857
She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla once,
but I'm not into that rough stuff.

961
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:41,692
I'm a missionary man.

962
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:47,198
-With a strong left.
-Am I on trial here?

963
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:50,034
Not yet.

964
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,050
Good afternoon, detectives.
What can I do for you?

965
01:12:11,848 --> 01:12:16,561
-This warrant's bullshit.
-It's good enough to search your house.

966
01:12:16,644 --> 01:12:19,564
It would have been smart if you had told me
that you had a Woodsman.

967
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:24,944
-There's one registered to you.
-Let's go for a drive.

968
01:12:37,915 --> 01:12:43,212
-All right. Let's bag the box.
-You can't do ballistics on a box, can you?

969
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:48,426
-Modern technology.
-So, why didn't you report this stolen?

970
01:12:48,676 --> 01:12:52,847
-I don't know. But maybe I should have.
-You think?

971
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,182
Still and all, we're gonna have a look
around the place, huh?

972
01:12:55,266 --> 01:13:00,521
-Go crazy. You got the warrant.
-All right. Let's start with the couch.

973
01:13:00,605 --> 01:13:01,981
Sir, stand up.

974
01:13:04,108 --> 01:13:06,360
You know, we got a history on the piece.

975
01:13:06,444 --> 01:13:09,906
It turns out it once belonged
to Mickey Cohen, the gangster from the '40s.

976
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:12,909
I know. My father, he represented him.

977
01:13:13,075 --> 01:13:17,455
Got him off for using it in self-defense,
so Mickey made him a present of it.

978
01:13:17,538 --> 01:13:18,706
It's a nice present.

979
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:21,876
-Pearl handle, collector's piece.
-How sweet.

980
01:13:21,959 --> 01:13:26,380
You know, that Mickey Cohen shooting
is pretty famous.

981
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:30,635
It turns out that the county still has
the evidence in storage. The bullet.

982
01:13:30,718 --> 01:13:34,221
You can match the casings from a slug
that's 50 years old?

983
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:37,850
Well, I mean, it would be easier
with the gun, but, yeah.

984
01:13:40,603 --> 01:13:42,146
How long will ballistics take?

985
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:57,286
Hey, Mick, I got something for you.

986
01:13:58,746 --> 01:14:01,582
-You asked me to run that witness' name.
-Is that Corliss?

987
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:05,753
Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, right.
He's this lowlife type, not much came up,

988
01:14:05,836 --> 01:14:09,131
but sometimes he goes by DJ,
no punctuation,

989
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:11,968
-and when you run it that way...
-Tell me.

990
01:14:12,134 --> 01:14:15,596
He's played the courtroom snitch a lot.
Here and in Arizona.

991
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,351
-Both times, it got him early release.
-All right, this could be good.

992
01:14:20,434 --> 01:14:22,186
All I gotta do is find him.

993
01:14:22,269 --> 01:14:24,438
They put him in pretrial rehab at USC.

994
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,905
I just got lucky.

995
01:14:38,869 --> 01:14:42,999
There she is. How are you, sweetie?

996
01:14:43,082 --> 01:14:44,208
-You all right?
-Yeah.

997
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:48,254
All right, listen.
I'm actually not even here about you today.

998
01:14:48,337 --> 01:14:50,214
I need you to do something for me.

999
01:14:50,715 --> 01:14:53,050
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

1000
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:58,639
Stay on the wall all the way down.
Nuts to butts, boys. Let's go.

1001
01:14:58,723 --> 01:15:00,224
Shut up.

1002
01:15:02,768 --> 01:15:06,022
-That's it. Stay on the line.
-Corliss, right?

1003
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:12,737
I'm gonna say this real quiet.

1004
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,740
Trustee, away from the line!

1005
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:22,163
You don't know me, but I talked to the DA,
and he gave me a way to get us both out.

1006
01:15:32,214 --> 01:15:35,509
So, Haller, I hear you had
interesting visitors last night.

1007
01:15:35,593 --> 01:15:37,595
Worry about yourself, Ted.

1008
01:15:37,678 --> 01:15:42,516
You're dying the death of a thousand razors
up there and you don't even know it.

1009
01:15:52,943 --> 01:15:56,447
One last witness, Your Honor.
The prosecution calls Regina Campo.

1010
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:00,076
It's true that I lied to the police.

1011
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,203
I knew the defendant
when he came to the door.

1012
01:16:02,286 --> 01:16:05,206
Miss Campo, why did you lie?

1013
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:09,126
Because I was scared.

1014
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:12,880
I didn't think the police would believe me,
and I wanted to make sure they arrested him.

1015
01:16:12,963 --> 01:16:17,134
-'Cause he's an animal.
-Do you regret your decision now?

1016
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:20,596
Yes. If it helps him get free
and do this to somebody else.

1017
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:24,809
-Objection. It's prejudicial, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

1018
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:29,605
-I have no further questions for Miss Campo.
-Your witness, Mr. Haller.

1019
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,943
Miss Campo, have you engaged an attorney

1020
01:16:34,026 --> 01:16:38,322
to sue Louis Roulet for the events
that happened on the eve of March the 6th?

1021
01:16:38,864 --> 01:16:41,492
-No, I haven't.
-Have you talked to an attorney?

1022
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:45,412
- I haven't hired anyone.
-No, have you talked to one?

1023
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:47,164
About a possible lawsuit?

1024
01:16:47,248 --> 01:16:50,292
It was nothing more than talk.

1025
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:53,337
Did you ask
if you could sue him for damages?

1026
01:16:55,339 --> 01:16:57,508
I thought what you say to a lawyer is private.

1027
01:16:57,842 --> 01:16:59,927
If you wish, you can tell the jurors.

1028
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:06,851
- I think I'd like to keep it private.
-Okay.

1029
01:17:08,811 --> 01:17:11,772
Let's talk about the night
at the Association bar.

1030
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:14,275
Had you ever seen Louis Roulet
before that night?

1031
01:17:14,984 --> 01:17:19,238
-Yes. There and other places.
-Ever notice that he wore a Rolex watch?

1032
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:20,739
No.

1033
01:17:20,823 --> 01:17:24,702
Or that he drove one of two vehicles,
a Maserati and a Range Rover?

1034
01:17:25,494 --> 01:17:28,789
-I never saw him driving.
-And what made you approach him?

1035
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:34,086
-I saw him leave with girls who do what I do.
-With prostitutes?

1036
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:37,339
They go to a hotel
or one of their apartments, right?

1037
01:17:37,673 --> 01:17:39,008
I don't know where.

1038
01:17:39,091 --> 01:17:41,969
Well, how do you know they left?
Maybe they just went out for a smoke.

1039
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:44,805
Because I saw them get in his car
and drive away.

1040
01:17:44,889 --> 01:17:49,268
Now, wait a minute. You just testified
that you had never seen Mr. Roulet drive.

1041
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,938
Now you are saying that, yes,
you did see Mr. Roulet get in his car

1042
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:56,734
and leave with a prostitute like yourself.
Which one is it?

1043
01:17:56,942 --> 01:18:00,696
I saw him get in his car,
but I didn't know what kind of car it was.

1044
01:18:00,863 --> 01:18:03,282
Do you know the difference
between a Maserati and a Range Rover?

1045
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:07,244
-One is small and one is big, I guess.
-Okay.

1046
01:18:11,248 --> 01:18:13,667
The other women

1047
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:17,296
that left with Louis,
when you saw them again,

1048
01:18:17,379 --> 01:18:20,466
did any of them have injuries
or were any of them beaten?

1049
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:22,092
I don't know. I didn't ask.

1050
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:27,139
But girls in your profession, you do talk
to each other about customers, right?

1051
01:18:27,223 --> 01:18:30,476
You warn each other
if someone's a freak or something?

1052
01:18:30,559 --> 01:18:32,311
Yeah, usually.

1053
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:36,148
And did any of them ever warn you or have
one bad thing to say about Louis Roulet?

1054
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:39,485
No. No one.

1055
01:18:39,568 --> 01:18:41,820
So you believed you'd be safe?

1056
01:18:42,112 --> 01:18:45,407
I thought he was a known quantity,
and I needed the money, so...

1057
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:48,744
So you thought
he could solve your problems with money.

1058
01:18:48,827 --> 01:18:52,039
-No!
-No? Isn't that why you're sitting here?

1059
01:18:52,122 --> 01:18:53,832
Because you zeroed in on him?

1060
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:57,836
No! I mean, yes, but it wasn't like that.

1061
01:18:59,838 --> 01:19:02,800
He attacked me, I swear!

1062
01:19:07,763 --> 01:19:10,307
And... All right, let's pause that right there.

1063
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:17,106
Just to confirm, this is you,
right, Miss Campo?

1064
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:20,609
-Yes.
-What was on the napkin?

1065
01:19:21,485 --> 01:19:23,445
My name and address.

1066
01:19:23,946 --> 01:19:27,700
-And your price?
-Yes. $400.

1067
01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:32,162
-It's a hard line of work.
-Yes, and dangerous.

1068
01:19:32,496 --> 01:19:34,665
In fact,
haven't you told your friends many times

1069
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,500
that you were looking for a way out?

1070
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:40,796
-I'm not proud of what I do.
- I know.

1071
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:46,051
And isn't it true,
and nothing would be easier to understand,

1072
01:19:46,135 --> 01:19:49,305
that you saw Louis Roulet
and his money as that way out?

1073
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:51,849
No, that's not what this is about!

1074
01:19:53,809 --> 01:19:55,436
Are you not listening to me?

1075
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,688
No further questions, Your Honor.

1076
01:19:57,771 --> 01:20:01,025
Mr. Minton,
do you have another witness for us?

1077
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:06,405
He really looks worried.

1078
01:20:06,488 --> 01:20:08,198
Not worried enough.

1079
01:20:11,201 --> 01:20:13,746
No. The state rests, Your Honor.

1080
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,625
Then the defense will call its first witness
after lunch.

1081
01:20:19,084 --> 01:20:21,420
Yes, I recognize this knife.

1082
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:24,965
It's the one that my son
has carried with him for protection

1083
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:30,637
-for the last four years, almost exactly.
-Why would he need protection?

1084
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:35,100
Realtors alone in a house
are sometimes robbed

1085
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:37,603
or hurt, even raped or murdered.

1086
01:20:39,188 --> 01:20:41,857
But has Louis ever been the subject
of such a crime?

1087
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:43,776
No.

1088
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:48,155
But he knew someone
who was raped and robbed by a man.

1089
01:20:48,906 --> 01:20:52,826
Louis found her. It was terrible.

1090
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:56,121
So the first thing he did afterwards
was get himself a knife,

1091
01:20:56,455 --> 01:21:00,793
-to carry with him at all times.
-Thank you, Mrs. Windsor.

1092
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:03,003
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

1093
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:06,590
-Your witness, Mr. Minton.
-Miss Windsor,

1094
01:21:07,049 --> 01:21:12,012
you seem pretty exact about when it was
your son started carrying around this...

1095
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:15,724
This weapon. A five-inch folding knife.

1096
01:21:15,808 --> 01:21:17,101
Yes, I am.

1097
01:21:17,476 --> 01:21:21,855
The incident took place
on June the 9th, 2007.

1098
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:25,484
-Was it in the newspapers?
-No.

1099
01:21:26,276 --> 01:21:30,489
Do you somehow remember it
because the police came to talk to Louis?

1100
01:21:30,572 --> 01:21:32,950
No, there was no police investigation.

1101
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:35,452
Then how do you remember the exact date?

1102
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:38,580
Were you given it
before your testimony here today?

1103
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:43,377
I remember the date because
I'll never forget the day I was attacked.

1104
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:48,215
And Louis won't forget it, either.
He found me in the house, tied up.

1105
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:50,926
My clothes were ripped.

1106
01:21:54,263 --> 01:21:56,974
It was traumatic for him.

1107
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:06,108
Mr. Minton,
is there anything else you wish to ask?

1108
01:22:09,153 --> 01:22:11,321
No, Your Honor.

1109
01:22:21,165 --> 01:22:24,334
So, I've been thinking about
those thousand razors.

1110
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:37,264
We've had an offer.
You can spend six months in a county jail.

1111
01:22:37,347 --> 01:22:41,602
Like I told you from the beginning,
no deals, no bargaining, I'm innocent.

1112
01:22:41,685 --> 01:22:44,897
Save it. You make the call.
I don't give a shit.

1113
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:48,734
-You got my answer.
-Yes, I do. I'll pass it along.

1114
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:51,320
-You do that.
-Louis,

1115
01:22:53,322 --> 01:22:54,573
tomorrow,

1116
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:58,994
I'm putting you on the stand.

1117
01:22:59,077 --> 01:23:01,663
-I'm ready.
-You better be.

1118
01:23:12,674 --> 01:23:14,885
Hey, Earl.

1119
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:19,556
There's something I need you to get for me.

1120
01:23:22,559 --> 01:23:26,688
Your Honor,
the defense calls Louis Ross Roulet.

1121
01:23:26,772 --> 01:23:27,773
I knocked.

1122
01:23:28,357 --> 01:23:32,277
She looked through a side window
and saw that it was me and opened the door.

1123
01:23:32,361 --> 01:23:36,198
Then I walked past her
toward the living room.

1124
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:39,451
-What happened next?
-Something hit me from behind.

1125
01:23:39,535 --> 01:23:43,080
I blacked out. I have no idea for how long.

1126
01:23:43,163 --> 01:23:44,456
Is that all?

1127
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,376
When I woke up,
two guys were sitting on me,

1128
01:23:47,918 --> 01:23:53,090
telling me not to move.
I couldn't anyway. I was scared.

1129
01:23:54,132 --> 01:23:57,803
But you had blood on your sweater.
And on your left hand.

1130
01:23:58,136 --> 01:24:00,180
Someone put it there because I didn't.

1131
01:24:00,264 --> 01:24:02,516
You didn't strike Miss Campo
with your left fist?

1132
01:24:02,599 --> 01:24:05,018
-No.
-Threaten to rape her? Threaten to kill her?

1133
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:06,979
No, I am not that guy!

1134
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:12,859
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be accused of something like this?

1135
01:24:12,943 --> 01:24:16,572
To sit there and listen to people
tell lies about you,

1136
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:20,659
about your having done something
this sick and depraved,

1137
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:25,205
call you an animal, talk about your sex life,
humiliate you?

1138
01:24:25,789 --> 01:24:27,457
Listen, I understand the process.

1139
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:31,837
I know I had to sit there
and be quiet and wait my chance,

1140
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,092
but if guilty people have rights,
then what about innocent people?

1141
01:24:37,342 --> 01:24:38,844
I am innocent!

1142
01:24:41,763 --> 01:24:45,017
I'm innocent and I want this behind me!

1143
01:24:46,685 --> 01:24:49,688
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1144
01:24:49,771 --> 01:24:55,569
According to you,
Miss Campo punched herself,

1145
01:24:55,694 --> 01:24:58,155
or she had someone she had never met

1146
01:24:58,572 --> 01:25:02,534
violently and viciously beat her
as a part of a setup?

1147
01:25:02,618 --> 01:25:07,497
-All I know is that I didn't.
-And this knife that you always carry.

1148
01:25:07,831 --> 01:25:10,042
How did she know she'd find it on you
as part of the setup?

1149
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:15,255
I guess she couldn't, could she?
I never take it out, I never show it to anyone,

1150
01:25:15,339 --> 01:25:19,259
so she must have just found it
in my pocket after she,

1151
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:22,179
or whoever, knocked me out.
Isn't that right?

1152
01:25:22,346 --> 01:25:26,141
- Would prefer if I asked the questions.
-Okay.

1153
01:25:27,517 --> 01:25:32,898
Mr. Roulet, I'd like you to take a...
Take a look at this photo.

1154
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:33,982
Tell me again.

1155
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:40,530
Do you think Regina Campo would or could
have done this to herself?

1156
01:25:41,573 --> 01:25:46,662
I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me.
Nobody deserves that to happen.

1157
01:25:46,745 --> 01:25:49,331
What do you mean by "deserves"?

1158
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:54,086
Do you mean crimes of violence

1159
01:25:54,169 --> 01:25:57,506
only come down to a woman
getting what she deserves?

1160
01:25:57,589 --> 01:26:01,259
I mean, no matter what she does,
or who she is,

1161
01:26:02,678 --> 01:26:04,513
no woman deserves that.

1162
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:09,267
I have nothing further, Your Honor.

1163
01:26:10,143 --> 01:26:14,106
-Mr. Roulet, you are excused.
-Thank you.

1164
01:26:15,107 --> 01:26:17,567
The defense rests, Your Honor.

1165
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:34,918
Before deciding to rest its case, the state
would like to take the night, Your Honor.

1166
01:26:35,502 --> 01:26:38,922
-For what purpose?
-To consider a rebuttal witness.

1167
01:26:40,382 --> 01:26:43,927
-What witness is he talking about?
-I have no idea.

1168
01:26:44,761 --> 01:26:49,266
The court will adjourn until 10:00 tomorrow.

1169
01:27:07,784 --> 01:27:09,453
-Morning, Bill.
-Morning.

1170
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:11,580
I want to go grab some coffee.
You want some?

1171
01:27:11,663 --> 01:27:15,083
-No, man. I'm off caffeine.
-Right. Say, is that the custody list?

1172
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:16,168
Yeah.

1173
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:18,086
Let me see if any of my no-good clients
are on there.

1174
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,296
Sure.

1175
01:27:25,051 --> 01:27:27,012
Lorna.

1176
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:29,890
Okay, Minton's putting Corliss on.
He's already in lockup.

1177
01:27:29,973 --> 01:27:31,308
-That's great.
-Yeah, it's good.

1178
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:33,185
How'd it go with you?
Did you serve Kurlen?

1179
01:27:33,393 --> 01:27:36,730
-Yes, I did.
-Okay. I'm going back to the courtroom.

1180
01:27:36,813 --> 01:27:37,898
Stand by.

1181
01:27:37,981 --> 01:27:39,232
Okay.

1182
01:27:41,818 --> 01:27:46,072
Hey, Haller, what is this bullshit?
I have nothing to do with this case.

1183
01:27:46,156 --> 01:27:49,075
"Subpoena to appear as a witness."

1184
01:27:49,159 --> 01:27:53,330
You'll just have to wait and see.
It's a legal document, Detective.

1185
01:28:10,972 --> 01:28:14,100
-Hey. Glad you made it.
-Working your magic?

1186
01:28:14,184 --> 01:28:17,854
- I got a little something up my sleeve.
-See you later.

1187
01:28:24,194 --> 01:28:26,947
Mr. Minton,
does the state have any rebuttal?

1188
01:28:29,866 --> 01:28:32,786
The state intends to call
Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss

1189
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:34,162
as a rebuttal witness, Your Honor.

1190
01:28:34,246 --> 01:28:38,500
Judge, who is this witness?
And why wasn't I told about him until now?

1191
01:28:39,084 --> 01:28:40,836
Bailiff, remove the jury.

1192
01:28:48,051 --> 01:28:50,512
A fair question. Mr. Minton.

1193
01:28:50,595 --> 01:28:53,765
Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness
who spoke with Mr. Roulet

1194
01:28:53,849 --> 01:28:55,225
in custody following his arrest.

1195
01:28:55,308 --> 01:28:58,395
-That's a lie! I didn't speak to anyone!
-Be quiet, Mr. Roulet!

1196
01:28:58,603 --> 01:29:01,731
-Mr. Haller, control your client.
-Good. Let me take it from here.

1197
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:04,568
Judge, I share my client's outrage.

1198
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:07,487
And how long has the state
been sitting on this testimony?

1199
01:29:07,571 --> 01:29:09,364
Mr. Corliss just came forward yesterday,
Your Honor.

1200
01:29:09,447 --> 01:29:12,534
Yesterday? This is incredible.

1201
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:16,454
Do you want to go back and talk to him?
Given the timing, I'd allow it.

1202
01:29:16,538 --> 01:29:20,083
No. Thank you, though, Judge.
I think we all know what this is.

1203
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:23,003
Mr. Minton's putting a jailhouse snitch
on the stand,

1204
01:29:23,086 --> 01:29:24,713
and everything he says will be a lie.

1205
01:29:24,921 --> 01:29:28,341
-That's groundless, Your Honor.
- want my objection noted.

1206
01:29:28,425 --> 01:29:33,054
Then I'm going to rule. He can testify.
Call the jury in.

1207
01:29:33,388 --> 01:29:35,724
May I ask one indulgence, Your Honor?

1208
01:29:35,807 --> 01:29:38,602
May I step into the hallway
and make a call to an investigator

1209
01:29:38,727 --> 01:29:41,479
for whatever good it may do
at this late date?

1210
01:29:41,563 --> 01:29:43,857
Thank you, Your Honor.

1211
01:29:51,281 --> 01:29:52,616
Yep, I'm here.

1212
01:29:53,116 --> 01:29:56,786
Come to the courthouse at exactly 10:15
with the printouts.

1213
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:04,502
Mr. Corliss,
are you incarcerated at this time?

1214
01:30:07,464 --> 01:30:08,965
No, now I'm just in a courtroom.

1215
01:30:11,259 --> 01:30:16,598
But you are currently being held
in the jail ward at USC hospital, correct?

1216
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:21,937
-Yeah. Since I got arrested.
-For burglary and drug possession?

1217
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:25,273
-That's right.
-Now,

1218
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,277
do you know the defendant?

1219
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:36,034
Yeah. I met him in lockup.
We was bused over from jail.

1220
01:30:36,117 --> 01:30:39,204
Then we were together in the tank
when we came for first appearances.

1221
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:42,082
-Did you talk at that time?
-Yeah.

1222
01:30:42,165 --> 01:30:44,626
Talked about how bad we needed cigarettes.

1223
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:45,752
Anything else?

1224
01:30:45,835 --> 01:30:49,839
You know, "What are you in for?" Like that.

1225
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:53,093
And did he say what he was in for?

1226
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:57,430
He said, "For giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved."

1227
01:30:57,514 --> 01:30:58,765
Those were his words.

1228
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:03,228
"For giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved."

1229
01:31:04,688 --> 01:31:07,190
Now, have I or anyone else promised you

1230
01:31:07,273 --> 01:31:09,067
anything in exchange
for your testimony today?

1231
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:14,280
-No. It's just the right thing to do.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

1232
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:33,883
How many times have you been arrested,
Mr. Corliss?

1233
01:31:35,343 --> 01:31:37,679
About seven times in LA.

1234
01:31:37,762 --> 01:31:40,640
A couple more in Phoenix and New York,
if you want to count those.

1235
01:31:40,724 --> 01:31:43,560
Yeah, so you know
how the system works, yeah?

1236
01:31:43,643 --> 01:31:45,562
- I try to survive.
-Right.

1237
01:31:45,729 --> 01:31:48,106
Does that sometimes mean
ratting out fellow inmates?

1238
01:31:48,189 --> 01:31:49,941
Your Honor, I object.

1239
01:31:50,025 --> 01:31:53,278
Take a seat, Mr. Minton.
I gave you leeway bringing this witness in.

1240
01:31:53,653 --> 01:31:56,281
Thank you, Your Honor, but I'll rephrase.

1241
01:31:56,364 --> 01:32:00,326
What I'm asking you is how many times
have you snitched on a fellow inmate?

1242
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:02,704
-This makes my fourth.
-This makes your fourth time.

1243
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:08,043
Four times you've testified
for the prosecution against a fellow inmate.

1244
01:32:08,585 --> 01:32:10,545
It makes you a popular man, Mr. Corliss.

1245
01:32:10,628 --> 01:32:14,007
It sounds like people just come up to you,
tell you the crimes that they've committed,

1246
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,634
SO you can come in here
and testify against them.

1247
01:32:16,718 --> 01:32:18,553
People talk to me. I'm a friendly guy.

1248
01:32:18,636 --> 01:32:22,432
You're a friendly guy? And you're saying
you and my client were friends?

1249
01:32:22,515 --> 01:32:24,017
We was friendly.

1250
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,604
So, he just said to you what you just told us
and told the jury,

1251
01:32:27,687 --> 01:32:30,940
that he gave a woman "what she deserved"?

1252
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:33,860
And then the two of you
went back to talking about cigarettes?

1253
01:32:33,943 --> 01:32:36,613
Not exactly. It's like he was bragging.

1254
01:32:38,364 --> 01:32:42,577
He told me he did it before.
Said the other time he killed the bitch.

1255
01:32:42,786 --> 01:32:46,081
He got away with it then,
he'd get away with it now.

1256
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,627
Mr. Haller.

1257
01:32:56,299 --> 01:33:00,011
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1258
01:33:00,095 --> 01:33:01,429
Redirect, Your Honor.

1259
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,061
What the hell is this?

1260
01:33:08,144 --> 01:33:09,354
You tell me.

1261
01:33:09,437 --> 01:33:14,067
-What the hell did you say to this guy, huh?
-Nothing. This is a setup. You're doing this.

1262
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:17,112
How? How am I doing this?

1263
01:33:20,365 --> 01:33:23,409
You say he was bragging. How?

1264
01:33:23,493 --> 01:33:27,956
Well, like, he told me the details.
Of the other one, that he killed.

1265
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:33,378
She was a dancer at some club,

1266
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:38,174
and she had a sexy snake tattoo
wrapped around her body.

1267
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:45,014
-Did he say anything else?
-No.

1268
01:33:47,976 --> 01:33:50,103
The snake girl stuff was it.

1269
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:56,151
-How does he know this, Louis?
-Do you think I know?

1270
01:33:56,234 --> 01:34:00,155
No. If you didn't tell him this shit,
somebody did.

1271
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:02,407
I'd start thinking about who that could be.

1272
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,534
Then I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

1273
01:34:06,327 --> 01:34:08,538
Any recross from the defense?

1274
01:34:13,835 --> 01:34:17,797
-A moment with my staff, Your Honor?
-Be quick.

1275
01:34:17,881 --> 01:34:19,591
-Is it all here?
-Yeah.

1276
01:34:19,674 --> 01:34:22,844
Okay, good. Now listen, you go now.
Leave the building.

1277
01:34:22,927 --> 01:34:23,970
I don't want anyone asking you questions,

1278
01:34:24,053 --> 01:34:25,013
-you got it?
-Okay.

1279
01:34:25,096 --> 01:34:26,097
All right.

1280
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:33,229
-Dwayne. Mind if I call you that?
-Sure, man. Wow on the assistant.

1281
01:34:35,231 --> 01:34:38,735
You're a funny guy, DJ.

1282
01:34:38,818 --> 01:34:40,195
"DJ."

1283
01:34:40,278 --> 01:34:43,865
Isn't that what they call you, for example,
down in Phoenix?

1284
01:34:44,574 --> 01:34:45,533
Maybe.

1285
01:34:45,617 --> 01:34:48,494
Well, my assistant,
the one whose number you want,

1286
01:34:48,578 --> 01:34:52,957
she was reading on the Internet
about a DJ Corliss,

1287
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:57,337
arrested in 1989 on drug charges,
hometown of Mesa, Arizona.

1288
01:34:58,087 --> 01:35:00,798
-Yeah, that'd be me.
-You do remember Fred Bentley, right?

1289
01:35:02,425 --> 01:35:05,053
Your Honor,
where is the defense going with this?

1290
01:35:05,136 --> 01:35:09,140
Make a connection soon, Mr. Haller.
But the witness will answer.

1291
01:35:10,099 --> 01:35:12,352
- I don't remember any Bentley.
-Sure you do.

1292
01:35:12,435 --> 01:35:16,981
You testified that he confessed to you
the crime that he was charged with.

1293
01:35:17,065 --> 01:35:21,444
Raping a 10-year-old girl.
But he denied it in court.

1294
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:24,739
Am I ringing any bells, DJ?

1295
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,618
In 1989, I was high a lot. I don't...
Not much I recall.

1296
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:31,162
Then I'd like you to read this for us.

1297
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:35,041
Your Honor, this is a news report
from the Arizona Star, 1997,

1298
01:35:35,124 --> 01:35:39,963
eight years after Mr. Bentley was convicted.
I ask that it be admitted into evidence.

1299
01:35:41,464 --> 01:35:44,717
Your Honor, a news report?

1300
01:35:45,718 --> 01:35:48,721
Let's see where it takes us.
The state can object later.

1301
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:51,975
Thank you, Your Honor.

1302
01:35:52,141 --> 01:35:54,686
If you could read this for us, Mr. Corliss.

1303
01:35:54,769 --> 01:35:57,355
I've highlighted the part
I'd like for you to read.

1304
01:35:57,438 --> 01:36:00,024
-I'm not good at reading.
-That's okay. You can take your time.

1305
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:02,110
We'll make it through it.

1306
01:36:04,028 --> 01:36:07,240
"A man, Frederick Bentley,

1307
01:36:09,117 --> 01:36:12,412
"wrongly convicted of rape,
was released Saturday

1308
01:36:12,495 --> 01:36:16,291
"after conclusive DNA results
cleared him of the crime.

1309
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:21,587
"The case was bolstered at trial
by testimony from an informant,

1310
01:36:21,671 --> 01:36:25,300
"DJ Corliss of Mesa,
who claimed Bentley had bragged to him

1311
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:27,302
"about the rape
while together in the holding cell."

1312
01:36:27,385 --> 01:36:30,346
That's enough. Thank you, Mr. Corliss.

1313
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:34,767
Were you charged with perjury
in this incident, DJ?

1314
01:36:34,851 --> 01:36:36,185
No, I was not.

1315
01:36:36,311 --> 01:36:39,439
Is that because the prosecution
was complicit in your confession?

1316
01:36:39,522 --> 01:36:40,565
Judge!

1317
01:36:40,732 --> 01:36:43,443
Were you promised the same thing here,
Mr. Corliss,

1318
01:36:43,526 --> 01:36:46,279
to say that Louis Roulet bragged to you
in the holding cell?

1319
01:36:46,362 --> 01:36:48,865
Isn't that what happened?
You lied then and you're lying now!

1320
01:36:48,948 --> 01:36:52,660
-All right, Mr. Haller! That will do!
-Objection, Your Honor!

1321
01:36:52,744 --> 01:36:55,705
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I have no more questions.

1322
01:36:56,748 --> 01:37:00,752
I'm excusing the jury for an early lunch.
Bailiff, see them out.

1323
01:37:07,717 --> 01:37:10,678
Mr. Minton,
do you know what you have done?

1324
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:14,807
You've put a documented liar on the stand,

1325
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:18,061
a man with a record
of putting innocent people in prison...

1326
01:37:18,186 --> 01:37:20,396
-Your Honor.
-Shut the hell up when I'm talking to you!

1327
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:27,528
I can think of nothing
more prejudicial or corrupt

1328
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:30,948
than what I just saw out there.

1329
01:37:31,115 --> 01:37:33,743
Do you realize what you've done to my trial?

1330
01:37:51,302 --> 01:37:54,055
He's going to talk to his boss
to decide what they want to do

1331
01:37:54,138 --> 01:37:56,808
before the judge comes down
with a directed verdict.

1332
01:37:56,891 --> 01:37:58,684
What's a directed verdict?

1333
01:37:58,768 --> 01:38:02,897
It's where the judge takes the case
from the jury's hands, declares an acquittal.

1334
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:04,357
Oh, my God.

1335
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:08,486
We'll know more in a few minutes.

1336
01:38:16,077 --> 01:38:20,373
I want to know
how Corliss got that shit he's saying!

1337
01:38:20,456 --> 01:38:23,209
Maybe Frank Levin told him.

1338
01:38:23,292 --> 01:38:28,464
Maybe he found something and gave it
to Corliss, and that's why you killed him.

1339
01:38:45,857 --> 01:38:47,817
Court's back in session.

1340
01:38:51,487 --> 01:38:54,031
Your Honor,
I spoke with the district attorney.

1341
01:38:54,115 --> 01:38:58,244
The state wishes to dismiss all charges.
You have the motion in front of you.

1342
01:38:58,327 --> 01:39:00,329
This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice.

1343
01:39:00,872 --> 01:39:03,332
-Case closed.
-Yes, Your Honor.

1344
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:06,919
Mr. Roulet, you're free to go.
Court's adjourned.

1345
01:39:09,505 --> 01:39:13,926
-Mr. Haller, thank you so much for my son.
-You're welcome.

1346
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,304
-You were splendid.
-Thank you.

1347
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:24,604
-I want the gun.
-Of course you do.

1348
01:39:26,314 --> 01:39:27,315
I want to talk.

1349
01:39:27,857 --> 01:39:28,858
Mr. Haller,

1350
01:39:29,484 --> 01:39:32,862
I insist you join us for dinner tonight
for a celebration.

1351
01:39:32,945 --> 01:39:35,781
-I don't think so.
-Louis Roulet,

1352
01:39:35,865 --> 01:39:38,618
-you're under arrest.
-What do you think you're doing?

1353
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:40,453
-Be quiet, Mother.
-Hands behind your back!

1354
01:39:40,536 --> 01:39:41,537
What's the charge?

1355
01:39:41,621 --> 01:39:44,624
He's under arrest
for the murder of Donna Renteria.

1356
01:39:44,707 --> 01:39:48,294
-Everything that man said was a lie!
-You have the right to remain silent.

1357
01:39:48,377 --> 01:39:50,796
You have the right to have
an attorney present during questioning.

1358
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,965
If you give up that right, anything you say

1359
01:39:53,049 --> 01:39:55,134
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1360
01:39:55,218 --> 01:39:57,220
Do you understand your rights
as I've read them to you?

1361
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,015
Hey! Look at me!
Do you understand your rights?

1362
01:40:01,098 --> 01:40:03,726
Detective, can I have a word with him?

1363
01:40:08,397 --> 01:40:12,109
Well, that's it, Louis. I got you off.

1364
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:16,697
Time to find yourself a new lawyer.

1365
01:40:16,781 --> 01:40:19,408
I've still got your gun.

1366
01:40:20,743 --> 01:40:23,871
And you're gonna have to explain
how you got it.

1367
01:40:28,793 --> 01:40:31,504
-Thank you, Detective.
-Come on, Louis.

1368
01:40:39,303 --> 01:40:42,557
-Mary...
-Not a word. You get my kid out of jail.

1369
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,935
Haller, you are one
messed-up son of a bitch.

1370
01:40:46,435 --> 01:40:51,524
First you get your client off for assault,
only to burn him for murder.

1371
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:56,696
You don't have enough to charge him
with the Renteria murder, do you?

1372
01:40:56,779 --> 01:40:58,447
They've got enough to screw with him.

1373
01:40:58,948 --> 01:41:01,826
There's no way the DA
was letting Roulet walk out of here,

1374
01:41:01,909 --> 01:41:04,120
not after what just happened.

1375
01:41:06,163 --> 01:41:10,126
I don't get you, Haller.
Whose side are you on, anyway?

1376
01:41:28,144 --> 01:41:29,562
God damn it!

1377
01:41:32,898 --> 01:41:33,983
Earl!

1378
01:41:36,819 --> 01:41:37,820
Dude.

1379
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:41,741
Hey, I'm sorry, boss. Look, I stepped away
for half a minute, all right?

1380
01:41:41,824 --> 01:41:44,702
-All right. All right, all right.
-You can take the ticket out of my pay.

1381
01:41:44,785 --> 01:41:47,288
You don't make enough. This one's on me.
Let's roll.

1382
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:48,372
All right.

1383
01:41:50,458 --> 01:41:53,669
All right, let's go to the house, Earl.

1384
01:41:54,712 --> 01:41:57,965
Hey, boss.
You know that favor you asked me?

1385
01:42:02,345 --> 01:42:05,848
A guy I know, he picked it up on the street.
Real clean.

1386
01:42:58,275 --> 01:43:01,362
-Hey, boss, be careful, all right?
-Yes, Sir.

1387
01:43:31,475 --> 01:43:34,895
Mick, it's me. I tried you on your cell.
Sorry to interrupt your day with Hayley,

1388
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:37,064
but you asked me to dig on Roulet.

1389
01:43:37,148 --> 01:43:40,651
Remember? You said you didn't buy it
that all he had was parking tickets?

1390
01:43:40,735 --> 01:43:43,320
Well, I might have found...

1391
01:43:43,529 --> 01:43:45,030
Maggie, I got it.

1392
01:43:45,114 --> 01:43:47,074
- I think I know why Frank Levin got killed.
-Yeah?

1393
01:43:47,158 --> 01:43:49,577
All right, call Lankford.
Have him pull up Roulet's driving record,

1394
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,162
every ticket he ever got.

1395
01:43:51,245 --> 01:43:54,707
That's what Frank did. He said
he found Martinez's ticket out of the Q.

1396
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:55,958
I just never knew what he meant.

1397
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:57,710
Okay, done,
but I have to tell you something.

1398
01:43:57,877 --> 01:44:01,922
They let Roulet go. They didn't have
enough to hold him. You were right.

1399
01:44:02,006 --> 01:44:03,507
I guess the family got involved.

1400
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:06,218
-Maggie, is Hayley with you?
-She's at my sister's. Why?

1401
01:44:06,302 --> 01:44:09,889
Go to your sister's, stay with Hayley,
and wait for my call. You got it?

1402
01:44:09,972 --> 01:44:11,348
Okay.

1403
01:44:16,395 --> 01:44:19,148
-Val, it's Mick Haller.
-Hey, Mick, haven't heard from you

1404
01:44:19,231 --> 01:44:22,860
since you busted into my office and accused
me of conspiracy to commit murder, huh?

1405
01:44:22,943 --> 01:44:25,196
If I had any self-respect,
I'd hang up on you right now.

1406
01:44:25,488 --> 01:44:27,531
It was Frank dying, all right?
I was out of my head.

1407
01:44:27,615 --> 01:44:30,117
- Need you to do me a favor.
-You need a favor? Okay.

1408
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:33,579
You got more balls than a Chinese
ping-pong tournament. I'll give you that.

1409
01:44:33,662 --> 01:44:36,791
Listen, man, you can kick my ass later,
all right? It's important.

1410
01:44:36,874 --> 01:44:39,710
-Is Roulet still wearing the tracer?
-Yeah, yeah, he is, yeah.

1411
01:44:39,794 --> 01:44:43,172
I got a call. He's coming in the morning
to get it off. I guess they kicked him, huh?

1412
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:46,300
-Yeah. I need you to track him for me.
-Man, I can't.

1413
01:44:46,675 --> 01:44:48,677
I can't.
I got a little biddy coming in a few minutes.

1414
01:44:48,803 --> 01:44:50,262
Val, Val! Stop whatever you're doing.

1415
01:44:50,346 --> 01:44:54,183
I need it, man. I need you to do it now.
It's about my family.

1416
01:44:58,187 --> 01:44:59,188
Yeah?

1417
01:44:59,855 --> 01:45:02,858
It's me.
He's headed up north on San Fernando.

1418
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,445
Mick, I think he's headed for your house.
Do you want me to call the cops for you?

1419
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:07,530
Bullshit.

1420
01:45:07,863 --> 01:45:10,866
I'm telling you,
he just passed Dodger Stadium.

1421
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:13,619
No, no, no, he's not going to my house, Val.

1422
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,247
You're right, you're right, Mick.

1423
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:18,749
He just shot past your street.
He's not headed for your house.

1424
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,210
I know where he's going.

1425
01:45:23,087 --> 01:45:27,049
Hello? You're welcome. No, it's all right.
Don't worry about it.

1426
01:46:13,053 --> 01:46:16,599
Hello, Louis. My family's here.

1427
01:46:17,892 --> 01:46:20,102
- I know.
-You bring your knife?

1428
01:46:21,228 --> 01:46:22,479
And my gun?

1429
01:46:23,814 --> 01:46:26,191
-Maybe.
-Good.

1430
01:46:30,279 --> 01:46:33,699
"Cause I brought this.

1431
01:46:33,782 --> 01:46:37,036
You got one chance
to turn around and leave.

1432
01:46:39,955 --> 01:46:41,457
And then what?

1433
01:46:43,459 --> 01:46:47,421
You gonna keep coming back every night?
Every day?

1434
01:46:49,965 --> 01:46:54,011
Or just try to get me sent up to San Quentin
like Jesus Martinez?

1435
01:46:54,303 --> 01:46:56,388
No.

1436
01:46:56,472 --> 01:47:00,559
I'm not quitting until Martinez is free
and you're convicted of murder.

1437
01:47:00,935 --> 01:47:03,771
And when that needle goes in your arm,

1438
01:47:06,315 --> 01:47:08,525
that will be me.

1439
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:12,529
Well, why don't you
just shoot me right now?

1440
01:47:15,366 --> 01:47:17,868
I don't think I'll have to.

1441
01:47:19,161 --> 01:47:20,245
Hey!

1442
01:47:22,998 --> 01:47:25,334
That's my car! What are you doing?

1443
01:47:31,465 --> 01:47:33,842
Come on, now, get him up. Get up!

1444
01:47:35,844 --> 01:47:37,346
Hospital, not the morgue.

1445
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:05,165
-Hey, Mags.
-You were right, Mick. Roulet got a ticket

1446
01:48:05,249 --> 01:48:08,961
outside of Renteria's apartment
on the night that she was murdered.

1447
01:48:09,044 --> 01:48:11,171
It's all gonna be on the DA's desk
in the morning.

1448
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:14,800
-Where are you?
-Just about home.

1449
01:48:14,883 --> 01:48:17,469
What do you say I come pick up
you and Hayley at your sister's place

1450
01:48:17,553 --> 01:48:19,805
in an hour
and we go out for a nice dinner, huh?

1451
01:48:19,888 --> 01:48:23,183
Great. Yeah. See you in an hour.

1452
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:47,249
Breaking and entering, huh?

1453
01:48:47,916 --> 01:48:50,794
Just like your son.

1454
01:48:50,878 --> 01:48:52,588
You knew, Mr. Haller.

1455
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:54,840
You need to get the hell out of my house,
Mrs. Windsor.

1456
01:48:55,215 --> 01:48:56,884
You knew. You set him up.

1457
01:48:56,967 --> 01:49:01,138
The only person who was set up here
was me.

1458
01:49:01,221 --> 01:49:04,600
-And how'd that turn out for you?
-You have no idea who we are.

1459
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:08,187
I know that your son Louis is going down
for the murder of Donna Renteria.

1460
01:49:08,645 --> 01:49:11,857
I also know that I'm gonna burn his ass
for killing my friend, Frank Levin.

1461
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,609
-He didn't kill him.
-Yes, he did.

1462
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:17,863
He beat the tracer and he killed him.
Look, I'm not gonna talk about it with you.

1463
01:49:17,946 --> 01:49:20,574
Now, for the last time,
get the hell out of my house.

1464
01:49:20,657 --> 01:49:24,203
-You're not listening to me.
-No, you're not listening to me.

1465
01:49:24,286 --> 01:49:26,622
Mrs. Windsor, get the hell out of my house.

1466
01:49:27,956 --> 01:49:30,793
I told you my son didn't kill Frank Levin.

1467
01:49:32,127 --> 01:49:33,128
I did.

1468
01:49:58,195 --> 01:50:00,030
911, what's your emergency?

1469
01:50:28,684 --> 01:50:31,436
I thought I told you to be careful, man.

1470
01:50:33,355 --> 01:50:38,026
-Yeah, that's enough.
-Nobody till somebody shoots you.

1471
01:50:43,073 --> 01:50:47,369
-Hey, boss, feeling all right?
-Yeah, Earl. Solid.

1472
01:50:48,537 --> 01:50:51,540
Yeah, I heard down at the courthouse
that Martinez is out. Is that right?

1473
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,960
Yeah, it is.

1474
01:50:55,043 --> 01:50:59,423
And Roulet,
they're going for the death penalty on him?

1475
01:50:59,506 --> 01:51:01,133
Martinez is free.

1476
01:51:12,352 --> 01:51:16,023
-Boss, we got company.
-Yeah, I see that.

1477
01:51:16,106 --> 01:51:18,901
Pull over up here to the left, say hello.

1478
01:51:48,388 --> 01:51:50,390
What do you say, Eddie?

1479
01:51:50,474 --> 01:51:53,810
-You took one for the team, huh?
-Yeah.

1480
01:51:53,894 --> 01:51:58,273
-Did you really shoot your client's mother?
-Damn right I did. She shot me first.

1481
01:52:00,943 --> 01:52:03,278
Well, I'm glad you're better,

1482
01:52:03,779 --> 01:52:07,699
'cause my boy Harold, old hard case...

1483
01:52:07,783 --> 01:52:08,951
Don't tell me.

1484
01:52:09,034 --> 01:52:12,871
Yeah, he got caught with 50 kilos
in his girlfriend's minivan.

1485
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:15,457
The girlfriend's some cop's wife.

1486
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,876
-That doesn't help.
-No.

1487
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:20,921
You're the only help he's got, Counselor.

1488
01:52:22,464 --> 01:52:24,841
All right. Call me with the details.

1489
01:52:24,925 --> 01:52:27,386
I gotta say, though,
the way things went down,

1490
01:52:27,469 --> 01:52:32,349
I think we earned a little discount.
Say, half your fee.

1491
01:52:37,062 --> 01:52:40,232
I tell you what, Eddie.

1492
01:52:40,315 --> 01:52:42,651
How about I do this one for free?

1493
01:52:49,866 --> 01:52:54,746
-Are you sure you're feeling all right?
-Repeat customers, Earl.

1494
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,581
We'll stick it to them next time.
