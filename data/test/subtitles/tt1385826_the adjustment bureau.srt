1
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,430
Let's welcome
our favorite alumnus,

2
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:56,558
and the next senator
from the state of New York,

3
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,477
David Norris!

4
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,897
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,649
Well, hi, there.

6
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,359
My name is David Norris,

7
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,654
and I'd like to be the next senator
from the great state of New York.

8
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,116
Look at you. What's your name?

9
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,617
I'm going to go through Yonkers,
door to door...

10
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,745
- And take the city that way.
- We love you.

11
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,538
The recent endorsement
by the fire fighter's union

12
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,914
is another boost to Norris

13
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:23,251
who already had a six-point lead
over his opponent, Roger Linfield.

14
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,213
Whenever I see you on C-Span,
and you stand,

15
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,758
I always think you're about to go, Chug!

16
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,343
Congressman, you certainly started
your career off,

17
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,722
eight years ago, with a bang
or should I say, a bust.

18
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,950
For the last eight years,

19
00:01:56,034 --> 00:02:00,789
David Norris has represented
Brooklyn, New York City and America.

20
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,916
This is my campaign chairman,
Charlie Traynor.

21
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,042
These are voters.

22
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,835
Latest polls have you up 10 points.

23
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,670
We're 10 points up?

24
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,672
This is not going to be easy getting there.

25
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,174
I have some real opposition,

26
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:14,594
and what they're saying about me is
that I'm too young to hold this office.

27
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,305
- Win big, but run like you're 20 down.
- Okay, you got it.

28
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,556
Thank you, Gary.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,642
But that's okay because
these are the same people

30
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,602
who say that young people don't vote,

31
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,063
young people don't care about politics,

32
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:29,651
but I'm here to tell you, your future
is about your choices, not theirs.

33
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,820
So, today I'd like to put them on notice

34
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,739
because come November,
I want them to know

35
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:38,827
that it was young people like you,
who kicked their asses.

36
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,582
David! David!

37
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,631
Thank you.

38
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,593
- Charlie.
- What's wrong?

39
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,283
- Yeah?
- Any ideas?

40
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,910
I'm working on it.

41
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,704
Keep me posted.

42
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,997
Yeah.

43
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:54,527
David Norris, until recently,
he was way ahead in the polls.

44
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,657
Mary Matalin and James Carville are here.
Mary, this is a surprise.

45
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,743
It is a surprise. Such political promise.

46
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,412
This compelling story, he grew up
in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.

47
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:08,416
He overcame the loss of his entire family,
his mom and his brother when he was 10,

48
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:12,462
his father before he got to high school,
he got over that. He had such promise.

49
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:16,925
And he was the youngest person ever
elected to the House of Representatives.

50
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,677
Yeah, he was elected
when he was actually 24,

51
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,764
but he gets in a bar room fight
the night that he's elected.

52
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,349
I like this, all right.

53
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,935
Then you have this photo
coming out of the New York Post.

54
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:31,439
I think the accretion of this stuff
was just too much for the voters.

55
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,777
It reeked of some level of immaturity here,
of impulsiveness.

56
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,030
People want maturity,
they want adults in Congress.

57
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,544
Big night for us, gentlemen.

58
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,505
Everybody ready?

59
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,635
You look exhausted.

60
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,179
You should take a vacation
when all this is finished.

61
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,430
You've earned it.

62
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,892
I'm not sure the kind of tired I am
can be fixed by a vacation.

63
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,645
Everybody needs a vacation,

64
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,313
even us.

65
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,316
All right, let's get him back on track.

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,943
Mary,
over the past couple of weeks

67
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,696
since the photo came out,
they thought people...

68
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,489
Why are you still watching CNN?

69
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,741
That it wasn't such a big deal,
but clearly it was.

70
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,452
They called this way too early.
Come on.

71
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,664
Put on your pretty little tie and let's go.

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,210
Suffolk County numbers,

73
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,922
Linfield, 415,120. Norris...

74
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,843
370,233.

75
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,474
I really thought we'd win Suffolk.

76
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,852
Kings County just came in too.

77
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,564
Well...

78
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:57,734
I didn't win Brooklyn.

79
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,485
It's going to be a blow out.

80
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,904
NBC has us up next.

81
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,036
- I'm going to go work on my speech.
- David...

82
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,163
David. Hey!

83
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,709
I'm sorry I wasted your time, Charlie.

84
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,050
NBC news is now calling the election
for Roger Linfield.

85
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,761
After a shockingly poor showing
at both Suffolk County,

86
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,429
and his home county, Kings,

87
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:30,808
it now appears David Norris
will lose this election badly.

88
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,693
Hello?

89
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,904
Hello?

90
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,573
I grew up in Red Hook,
and I don't want to surprise anybody,

91
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,700
but I got into a few fistfights along the way.

92
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:49,202
It's not whether or not
you get knocked down,

93
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,620
it's what you do when you get back up.

94
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,582
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here tonight
to tell you I will get back up.

95
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,710
But tonight is not about me.

96
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,087
It is about coming together

97
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,591
and welcoming the newest senator
for the great state of New York,

98
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,929
Roger Linfield.

99
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,932
Shit!

100
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,017
Shit, shit, shit.

101
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,936
Hello?

102
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,658
- It's the men's.
- Yep.

103
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,163
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

104
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,916
I just didn't know what to do.

105
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,417
I heard you come in and say, hello,

106
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,963
and I probably should have said, hi,
but then I thought that would be weird

107
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,881
because it's the men's.

108
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:48,761
Then you started talking to yourself
and it was obviously very personal.

109
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,763
So I was stuck in no man's land,

110
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,683
and then it all got to be too much,
so I came out.

111
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,227
What are you doing in here?

112
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,480
Just...

113
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,524
I'm hiding from security.

114
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,234
Why?

115
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,987
I crashed a wedding upstairs.

116
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,697
People still do that?

117
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,950
It was a dare.

118
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,744
Who dared you to crash a wedding?

119
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,831
Me.

120
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,253
- I crashed a wedding once.
- Did you?

121
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,671
Yeah, in high school.

122
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,592
But I got caught.
I spent the night in jail.

123
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,137
I think that happened more than once
from what I heard.

124
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,140
You're that guy running for Senate,
aren't you?

125
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,017
Yeah, I am that guy.

126
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,519
And judging from your speech,
you're not winning?

127
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,021
No.

128
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,231
That's too bad,
the other guy is such a tool.

129
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,692
He is a tool.

130
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,570
I wish I could have made that clearer
in the campaign ads.

131
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:52,033
Personally, I think mooning your friends
at a college reunion is no big deal.

132
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,202
The Post did not have to run the photo.

133
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:57,622
- At least not a full page.
- God, no.

134
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,835
It was my favorite moment
of your whole campaign.

135
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,297
Really? I could have used you on my team
a couple of months ago.

136
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,218
I could help poll test every word that
comes out of your mouth before you say it.

137
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,719
Oh, you like politicians?

138
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,888
I like it when they do stuff I can relate to.

139
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,307
- Like pull their pants down?
- I love that.

140
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:20,561
See, that kind of candidate wouldn't even
get elected to the student council.

141
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,563
My guy would know how to tie his own tie.

142
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,773
It's a clip-on.

143
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,608
Oh, I wish.

144
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,985
That would have been my other
favorite moment of your campaign.

145
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,198
Do you still have a chance?

146
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,075
Is it over?

147
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,868
He crushed me.

148
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,329
Sorry.

149
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,498
Well, losing has its advantages.

150
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,083
Like what?

151
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,127
For one thing, as a politician,
you're never really alone

152
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:48,881
unless you're asleep,
or in the bathroom usually.

153
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,217
That gets old.

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,969
Really?

155
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:58,057
Yeah, I guess I'm mostly just looking
forward to having some time by myself.

156
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:05,022
I don't buy it. I think you love it.

157
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,402
Do I know you?

158
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,286
I guess I could have been more convincing.

159
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,412
Okay.

160
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:23,249
You don't have to worry about being
convincing till the next election.

161
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,959
Are you a registered New York voter?

162
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,712
Do I sound like I am?

163
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:45,146
Holy shit.

164
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,025
David.

165
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,944
Wow, sorry, guys.

166
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,072
- Sorry.
- I got to go.

167
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,284
Sorry.

168
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,329
Hang on.

169
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,205
- You going to give your speech?
- Hang on.

170
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,498
Hey!

171
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,083
Hey.

172
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,337
Ma'am.

173
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,047
I got to go.

174
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,091
- Ma'am?
- That is so much better.

175
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,468
She's on the move.

176
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,262
Southwest staircase.

177
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,931
Excuse me? Ma'am.

178
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,017
What was that?

179
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,144
I don't know.

180
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,854
Are you ready?

181
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,481
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,233
All right, go do the speech.
Come on.

183
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,195
Congressman David Norris.

184
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,034
I grew up not far away from here,
in Red Hook.

185
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,286
- Brooklyn!
- I love you, David!

186
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,080
I love you more!

187
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,456
I love you both.

188
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,460
But we had a rule in my neighborhood.

189
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,129
When you got in a fight,

190
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,217
it wasn't whether or not
you got knocked down,

191
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,221
it's what you do when you get back up.

192
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:08,771
And I came here to tell you tonight,
that I will get back up.

193
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,997
It's bullshit.

194
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,251
We didn't have that saying
in my neighborhood.

195
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,462
It's just one of those phrases

196
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,133
that had some traction
with the focus group

197
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,261
and so we kept using it,
but it's not true.

198
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,013
In 1998, I did a cover story for GQ.

199
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:46,308
The title was Youngest Congressman Ever.

200
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:51,230
And since then, every story has tried
to explain how I got here so fast.

201
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:57,486
And the word that people kept using
was authentic.

202
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:03,033
But here's the problem.

203
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,455
This isn't even my tie.

204
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,374
- Go get Jim for me.
- This tie was selected for me

205
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,712
by a group of specialists
in Tenafly, New Jersey

206
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,716
who chose it over 56 other ties we tested.

207
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,970
In fact, our data suggests
that I have to stick to

208
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,932
either a tie that is red or a tie that is blue.

209
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:30,728
A yellow tie made it look
as if I was taking my situation lightly,

210
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,230
and I may in fact, pull my pants down again
at any moment.

211
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,527
A silver tie meant
that I'd forgotten my roots.

212
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,530
My shoes...

213
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,491
You know, shiny shoes,

214
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:48,537
we associate with high-priced lawyers
and bankers.

215
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,249
If you want to get a working man's vote,
you need to scuff up your shoes a little bit.

216
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,419
But you can't scuff them up so much that
you alienate the lawyers and the bankers

217
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,589
because you need them to pay
for the specialists back in Tenafly.

218
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,926
So, what is the proper scuffing amount?

219
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,055
Do you know we actually paid
a consultant $7,300...

220
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,806
Was it $7,300, Charlie?

221
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,517
Nice. What an asshole.

222
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,397
$7,300, for a consultant to tell us
that this is the perfect amount of scuffing.

223
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,104
He has to spill his coffee on his shirt
by 7:05.

224
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,982
7:05 at the latest.

225
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,776
I'll get him as soon as he enters the park.

226
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,573
Can't imagine being on this guy
as long as you have.

227
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,631
For energy efficient technologies.

228
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,758
RSR Venture Capital announced yesterday

229
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,262
that former Congressman David Norris,
would become a senior partner.

230
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,390
Norris led an unsuccessful bid
for Senate last month.

231
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,102
But his concession speech was considered,
by many, to be electrifying

232
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,939
and has made him the obvious
front runner in the 2010 Senate race.

233
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,774
Investment banker Charles Traynor
founded RSR,

234
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,195
one of the country's most successful
venture capital firms.

235
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,782
Traynor is a childhood friend of Norris' and
was the Chairman of his Senate campaign.

236
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,867
- Hey!
- Hey.

237
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,785
Tom Frankel from The Journal
is calling you in five minutes.

238
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,037
I just gave him this number.

239
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,415
Give him 3-2-2-7.
I'm not used to this phone yet.

240
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,709
No, I can't.
He's going to ask you about joining the firm.

241
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,211
All business calls have to be done
on a company Blackberry.

242
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,422
- Really?
- Sarbanes-Oxley.

243
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,634
You voted for it, pal.
In fact, you co-sponsored that one.

244
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,552
Yeah, I remember.

245
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,179
Hey, I just saw you on TV.

246
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,305
- Really?
- Yeah.

247
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,473
What did they say?

248
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,515
You're bald.

249
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,309
Nice.

250
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,853
Yeah, it was weird too,
because it was a financial show.

251
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,398
But they were really captivated
by your receding hairline.

252
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,233
I got to go, you jack-off.

253
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,401
Bye.

254
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,450
Congressman.

255
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,620
I have to tell you,
I really admire what you did last month.

256
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,829
Thank you. I appreciate it.

257
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,581
I wish there were more politicians like you.

258
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,375
Thank you. I'm retired now.

259
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,668
I had to go get a real job.

260
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,670
- You'll do well.
- Thank you.

261
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,952
Hey!

262
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,288
You got a guy running for the bus.

263
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,957
There is another M6 right behind me.

264
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,458
Hey!

265
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,630
No way.

266
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,350
Sorry.

267
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,772
Oh, my God.

268
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,940
Have we met?

269
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,817
You look vaguely familiar.

270
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,194
- Waldorf men's room.
- You got it.

271
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,655
Were you just staring
at my legs while I slept?

272
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,742
I was defenseless against the small dress.

273
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,909
It's a skirt.

274
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,786
It's a belt.

275
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,250
What is it with you and the argyle?

276
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,794
What is the deal with you
and the boring shades of blue?

277
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,920
My clothes match.

278
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,547
Did your team pick that out for you?

279
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,923
No team. Team is gone.

280
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,675
I did it all by myself.

281
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,304
I saw your speech.

282
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,431
Yeah, the speech.

283
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,683
Something must have got into me.

284
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,812
Wow, that is something.

285
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,190
Really augments the moment.

286
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,316
Nice ring, asshole.

287
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,860
Hello? Hello?

288
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,986
It doesn't even work.

289
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,362
Could that ringer get louder

290
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,656
- or do you have that maxed out?
- It's a new phone.

291
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,952
Are you going to run again?

292
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,498
Don't know.
I'm starting a new job today.

293
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,792
You have to run again.
You can't do that.

294
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,836
The country will end up being
run by tools like Linfield.

295
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,962
It kind of is.

296
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,223
Oh, shit.

297
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,227
Sorry.
I don't know what just happened.

298
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,779
Are you okay?

299
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,823
I'm fine. Can you hand me that?

300
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,991
- You sure you okay?
- Yeah.

301
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,872
- I'll pay for the dry cleaning.
- No, it's really fine.

302
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,374
Please don't.

303
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,793
Seven bucks will probably cover it.

304
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,753
You keep that, you might need it.

305
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:30,921
You know what? Here.

306
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,466
You write your number down, then I can
call you and come pick up your skirt.

307
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,343
Oh, my goodness, me.

308
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,886
That is very smooth.

309
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:45,936
Oh, shit.

310
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,940
Why don't you let me spill some on you
and then we'll be even?

311
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,859
- That's a terrible idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

312
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,026
Just one bit because that's not fair.

313
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,487
You actually are crazy.
No, now it all makes sense.

314
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,282
Okay, hang on. Oh, jeez.

315
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,702
He's not here. I know, I'm sorry.

316
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,370
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Who cares?

317
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,497
- It'll be on the... Can you just...
- No.

318
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,417
Okay, now we're in the third grade.
This is great.

319
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,715
It's a sturdy little fucker, isn't it?

320
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,594
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened,
it just happened.

321
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,512
Okay.

322
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,598
- Okay, that was a new phone.
- Let's wipe it off.

323
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,558
I'm Elise, by the way.

324
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,894
I'll remember that.

325
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,691
- That's my number.
- Terrific, thank you.

326
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,613
I'll call you.

327
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,159
The morning after the election,
I woke up thinking about you.

328
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,468
Hey, man, what's up?

329
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,261
You're not going to believe
who I just ran into.

330
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,513
- Who?
- The girl from election night.

331
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,432
- The one you kissed?
- She kissed me.

332
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,642
You still sticking with that story?

333
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,268
- It's the truth.
- Whatever, dude.

334
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,103
They're ready for you
in the main conference room.

335
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,022
What are the odds? It's amazing.

336
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,192
That's great, man, just don't take
her advice on speeches anymore.

337
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,110
First time worked,
it's not going to work again.

338
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,696
You're just jealous
because it's the best speech I ever gave

339
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,864
and you didn't write it.

340
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,117
Just so you know, I think I'm coming down
against your solar panel thing.

341
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,535
Why?

342
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,204
I just don't think the research is there

343
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,289
and the price point is too high
on these things.

344
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,540
Of course, it's too high.

345
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,168
But if our company doesn't get involved
with stuff like this, who will?

346
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,544
Convince me in the meeting.

347
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,755
I will. See you, buddy.

348
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,523
Hey, Janet.

349
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,614
Hey, Susan.

350
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,379
We just got approval
for a recalibration on the Lasalle case.

351
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,755
Two minutes.

352
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:23,802
Hey!

353
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,013
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:28,974
Grab him.

355
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,110
9-1-1, Janet! 9-1-1!

356
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,910
You can't get away, David.

357
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,093
David, I really wish you'd just listen to me.

358
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,897
All right, I'll handle it.

359
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,489
David,

360
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,949
you really are making this
harder than it has to be.

361
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,835
All right, take it easy, guys.
Take it easy.

362
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,879
Take it easy.

363
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,839
It's okay, David.

364
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,933
No. No, sir.

365
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,603
It's being taken care of.

366
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,148
Yes, sir. It's being taken care of.

367
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,692
Yes, sir. No, sir.

368
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,196
No, sir. Yes, sir.

369
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,032
I understand. I'll take care of it.

370
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,492
What a goddamn mess.

371
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,577
- Donaldson?
- Yes.

372
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,705
What do you want to do?

373
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,375
We have to reset him. Call for a briefcase.

374
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,503
You kidding? It's going to take
a signed order from the Chairman.

375
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,506
- Get legal on it.
- Legal just arrived.

376
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,843
There's no way
the Chairman approves a reset.

377
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,762
This is your fault.
There is no way you get a briefcase.

378
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:31,847
Hey.

379
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,223
- What are my options?
- Hey.

380
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,599
Just bullshit him.

381
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,101
Bullshit this guy?

382
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,979
Hey! What's going on here?

383
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,188
Look at this.

384
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,899
Questions will burn in him
till the day he dies.

385
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:47,195
He won't stop searching for answers.
He won't quit.

386
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,947
We have to watch him

387
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,491
forever, make sure he doesn't talk.

388
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,702
Endless ripple effects.

389
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,830
You remember the Torres case
40 years ago?

390
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,916
It's not that bad, is it?

391
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,712
In the end, they just leveled with him.

392
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,005
Completely?

393
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,007
Looking at that,
I don't see you have a choice.

394
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,009
Who the hell are you guys?

395
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,053
We...

396
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,933
are the people who make sure
things happen according to plan.

397
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,102
My name is Richardson.

398
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,038
You really think
I couldn't see that coming?

399
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,956
I can read your mind.

400
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,791
Yeah, really.

401
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,418
Pick a color.

402
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,711
Blue.

403
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:45,962
Pick a number. Seventeen.

404
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,341
Now, why are you still thinking
about running?

405
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,180
I don't really know what's going on here.

406
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,767
You've just seen behind a curtain that
you weren't supposed to know existed.

407
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,186
Must be jarring.

408
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,729
It's not your fault.

409
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,774
Your path through the world this morning
was supposed to have been adjusted.

410
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,778
You were supposed to spill your coffee
as you entered the park this morning.

411
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,739
You would have gone upstairs to change,
you would have missed the bus,

412
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:17,077
and you would have arrived at work
10 minutes later than you did,

413
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,787
and we would have been gone.

414
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,789
I was supposed to spill my coffee?

415
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,083
We call that an adjustment.

416
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,503
See, sometimes, when people spill
their coffee or their Internet goes out

417
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,256
or they misplaced their keys,
they think it's chance.

418
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,132
And sometimes it is.

419
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,343
Sometimes it's us...

420
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,845
nudging people back on plan.

421
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,015
Sometimes when nudging isn't enough,

422
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,102
management authorizes a recalibration.

423
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,896
We deploy our Intervention Team and

424
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,859
they change your mind for you,
like we did with your friend Charlie.

425
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,948
He's fine, by the way.
You don't need to worry about him.

426
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,449
Now...

427
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,037
There is something I need you to
understand if I'm going to let you go.

428
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,455
Okay.

429
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,374
Very few humans have seen
what you've seen today,

430
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,792
and we're determined to keep it that way.

431
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,337
So, if you ever reveal our existence,

432
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,798
we'll erase your brain.

433
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,634
The Intervention Team will reset you.

434
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:19,806
Your emotions, your memories,
your entire personality will be expunged.

435
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,142
Your friends and family will think
you've gone crazy.

436
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,895
You won't think anything.

437
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,236
You understand?

438
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,824
Not one word about us.

439
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,160
Okay.

440
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:43,872
Oh, one more thing, you bumped
into a woman this morning on the bus.

441
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,040
Elise?

442
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,834
What does that have to do with anything?

443
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,086
You were never supposed to see her again.

444
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,049
What does that matter?

445
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,925
Because it matters.

446
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,346
- It's in his wallet.
- Hey, hey. God! Hey!

447
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,266
What's with you guys? Jesus!

448
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,439
Oh, come on. No! No!

449
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,566
What the hell?

450
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,277
Really?

451
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,530
What the hell?

452
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,200
Okay.

453
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:23,995
- Okay.
- Take him back.

454
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,083
- Enjoy the rest of your day.
- I can walk. I'm capable of walking.

455
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,347
Dude, what are you doing on my floor?

456
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,183
You know, I called you like 10 times,
you could have picked up.

457
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,939
Christine, I found him. He's in my office.

458
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,357
What the hell are you doing?

459
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,695
Round up the guys,
we're going to do the meeting now.

460
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,656
You have a headache?

461
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,574
What is wrong with you?

462
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,039
Hey, we're in the big conference room on 17.
Let's go.

463
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,508
Morning, Congressman.

464
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,219
You sure you're okay?

465
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,929
Yeah, you?

466
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,139
I'm great, why?

467
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,849
You don't have a headache or anything?

468
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,809
No, I feel fantastic, man.

469
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,562
Is it me or is this an odd conversation?

470
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:33,606
On David's solar panel deal,
our tech guy has serious doubts

471
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,692
about the efficiency ratings they're claiming.

472
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,069
They'd need a 20-fold improvement
over anything anyone else

473
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:41,656
has been able to manufacture at that
price point to really be a game-changer.

474
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,909
You're opposed to this anyway, Charlie.
And with these financials...

475
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,120
I know it's a risk, but,

476
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:51,249
if our company doesn't take a chance
on something like this, then who will?

477
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:55,295
I mean, I'm willing to take a fire
on something that could change the world.

478
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,549
Not to mention, be incredibly lucrative.

479
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,306
David?

480
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,563
Yeah, I mean, it's why I took the job here.

481
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,483
All right.

482
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,401
Let's do it.

483
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,324
Come into my office for a second.

484
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,289
Something is wrong.

485
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:34,501
A couple of hours ago you miraculously
reunite with the girl of your dreams.

486
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,420
Explain to me why you don't have
an ear-to-ear grin right now.

487
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,346
I lost her number.

488
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,514
What?

489
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,518
The woman on the bus.

490
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:56,606
I lost her phone number
and all I had was her first name, so,

491
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,485
I'm never going to see her again.

492
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,447
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,116
Wow, I'm really sorry.

494
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:57,500
Your entire world is turned upside down
and you're thinking about a woman.

495
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,338
Even if you could remember the number,
you'll never get through.

496
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,591
Lost cell phone, changed numbers,

497
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,343
whatever creates the fewest ripples.

498
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,304
My name is Harry, by the way.

499
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,724
The fewest ripples?

500
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:18,354
You freeze people. You froze my friend.

501
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,315
We need special authorization to...

502
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,941
Poke around in people's brains.

503
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,402
- You make them think whatever you want...
- Be quiet, David.

504
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,530
- Can I get you something?
- Just some water, please.

505
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,657
Your friend will be fine.

506
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,245
Recalibrations make tiny changes
in the way people reason.

507
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,206
It doesn't work on emotion or personality.

508
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,458
That's too intrusive.

509
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,918
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?

510
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,253
The Chairman.

511
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,547
The Chairman?

512
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,883
That's just a name we use.

513
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,844
You use many other names.

514
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,432
We can't talk here.

515
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:00,647
Meet me on the 4:00 p.m. boat
and I'll answer what I can.

516
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,651
If you reveal us,
even if it's unintentional...

517
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,736
I know. You'll bump me on the head.

518
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:11,240
Richardson has automatic authority
to reset you.

519
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,493
You mean lobotomize me?

520
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,536
Try not to forget it.

521
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,413
Be on the 4:00 p.m. boat.

522
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:37,433
Ask your questions, I'll tell you what I can.

523
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,311
What were they doing to Charlie?

524
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,356
Just changing the way he weighs
investment risks

525
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:47,568
which will subtly shift the direction
of his company in the way upstairs wants.

526
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,737
So, Richardson could read my mind?

527
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,698
Richardson was trying to scare you.

528
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:54,409
No, he knew the number
I was thinking of, the color.

529
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,285
Because he set it up as a choice.

530
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,496
Choose a color, choose a number.

531
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,499
We can't read your mind
or hear your thoughts.

532
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,294
When you make a decision,
your mind weighs options.

533
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,713
We can perceive them.

534
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,382
We know when you're going to go
off the plan or not because

535
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,010
if we're close enough,
we can sense when it's going to happen.

536
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:17,306
We're just here to keep you on plan.
That's all we're authorized to do.

537
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,394
Are you allowed to be telling me this stuff?
Are they following me now?

538
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,521
We have to monitor the entire world.

539
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:27,817
We don't have the manpower
to follow everyone all the time.

540
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,611
And there is something about water.

541
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,573
It blocks our ability
to read your decision tree.

542
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,658
Are you an angel?

543
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,952
We've been called that.

544
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,371
We're more like case officers

545
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,249
who live a lot longer than humans.

546
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,792
Why are you helping me?

547
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,461
I have my reasons.

548
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,714
And why won't they let me be with Elise?

549
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,843
All I know is
the amount of resources they've used

550
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,680
keeping you from her
is pretty damn important to them.

551
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,851
You're going to look for her, aren't you?

552
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,687
You won't find her.

553
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,898
They'll make sure of it.

554
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,942
Even if they weren't trying to stop you,

555
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:13,196
there are nine million people in this city.

556
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,323
You'll never find her.

557
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,326
Forget about her.

558
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,411
Move on with your life.

559
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,702
Stop! Stop the bus!

560
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,010
Elise? Elise, hi.

561
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,845
David.

562
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,849
You know, I rode the M6 to work
every day for three years

563
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,518
hoping that I'd bump into you.

564
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,938
Listen, is there a place we could go
and talk?

565
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:15,401
Don't you have to get to work or something?

566
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,611
I just got sick.

567
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,613
I haven't seen you in three years,
you make me sick.

568
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,573
That's not an ideal come-on,
just so you know.

569
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:21,741
What are you looking for?

570
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,701
I felt like someone was watching us.

571
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,329
Hey, Charlie,
I'm going to have to skip breakfast,

572
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,332
and I probably have to postpone the speech too.
I just bumped into Elise.

573
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,917
You just hung up on your friend.

574
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,376
We've known each other since we were kids.

575
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,753
- What speech?
- It doesn't matter.

576
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,755
- You want to take a walk?
- No.

577
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,964
We have a lot to catch up on.

578
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,341
I don't think you should cancel your speech.

579
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,384
What if I don't like you
at the end of our walk?

580
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:41,802
I'll take my chances.

581
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:45,514
Seriously, my number hasn't changed,
just call me like you didn't last time.

582
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,392
Look, if you take a walk with me,
I'll explain why.

583
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,647
It's been years. How do you know
I don't have a nice boyfriend?

584
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,607
Do you have a nice boyfriend?

585
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,109
- Would it matter if I did?
- Yeah.

586
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:59,111
So you don't have any real conviction then?

587
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:00,488
Okay, it wouldn't matter at all.

588
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,615
So, you don't mind being a home-wrecker?

589
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:03,783
Congressman!

590
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,285
How are you doing, man? I'm from Red Hook.
You're the best.

591
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,329
Thank you. Good to see you.

592
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:11,958
If you were married, then it would bother me.

593
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,461
But now you're just saying
what you think I want to hear.

594
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,963
I'm single.

595
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,966
Now let's hear your bullshit excuse
for not calling me.

596
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,092
I didn't have your number.

597
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,760
I gave it you on the bus.
Handed it to you.

598
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,762
I was mugged. It was taken from me.

599
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,013
No, come on.

600
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,391
- My wallet was taken.
- Come on.

601
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,351
Why else would
I fawn all over you on a bus

602
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:31,811
three years ago and then never call you?

603
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,814
Because, I don't know!
You have a girlfriend and you felt terrible.

604
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:38,609
Listen, I swear to you
that I did not have your number.

605
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:39,735
All right.

606
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,363
No, on my parents' graves.

607
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,907
- That's heavy.
- That's too heavy, I know, but it's true.

608
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,575
I didn't have your number.

609
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,494
And I didn't even have a last name to go by.

610
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,663
If you google just Elise,

611
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,833
- you get 757,000 hits.
- You did not.

612
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,584
And none of them are you.

613
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,598
- We have a problem.
- What?

614
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,225
David Norris is off plan.

615
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,979
Son of a bitch. How did he find her?

616
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,815
Chance.
Just spotted her on the street.

617
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,067
We never should have let him meet her
in the first place.

618
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,445
We followed protocol to the letter.

619
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,072
Guy rides the same bus every day
for three years.

620
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:26,782
Who does that?

621
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,246
Three years later,
I'm still cleaning up your mess.

622
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,506
Let's cut the power
at her dance studio.

623
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:44,508
I'm a dancer.

624
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:49,055
Not like that, you pervert.
I'm in a contemporary ballet company.

625
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,848
I think you have the wrong idea about me.

626
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,476
No, I think that was the first thing
that crossed your mind, actually.

627
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,978
I think you should invite me
to one of your performances.

628
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,855
The company is called Cedar Lake,

629
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:01,108
and there is actually a show
tomorrow night, if you want.

630
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,235
- Is that an invitation?
- No, it's information.

631
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,114
We're covering the girl's artistic director
and we're still working on Charlie Traynor.

632
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:09,033
This whole thing will be over in an hour.

633
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,202
Hi, how are you? Paul, right?

634
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,913
- How did you remember that?
- I'm a politician, I'm good with names.

635
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,123
Her decision tree
is diverging from our models.

636
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,584
- It's just the two of you?
- Yes.

637
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,378
Thirty-six hours without contact,
she'll never speak to him again.

638
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,505
Look at her file.

639
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,840
It's the last thing in the world
she'll put up with.

640
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:28,052
No, something's wrong.
I'm already seeing inflection points.

641
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

642
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,939
We're in motion on changing
the location of her rehearsal.

643
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,067
You have to be born with the right body

644
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,112
like very flexible hips
and shoulders and long neck.

645
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,989
- And you weren't?
- No, I was. I was lucky.

646
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:52,535
But after 15 years of that precision
and the training...

647
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,786
How is everything over here?

648
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,204
It's great. Thank you.

649
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,039
It's good, thank you.

650
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,128
So, I wanted to try something else
just on my own,

651
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,880
open-ended and human, I guess.

652
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,715
What do you mean?

653
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,884
Look.

654
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,471
What's this?

655
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,973
If they kiss.

656
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,809
A kiss? That's all it takes?

657
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:17,977
A real kiss.

658
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,896
If that happens, every possible adjustment
strong enough to break them up

659
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,524
will cause ripples over your limit.

660
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,193
I think that everything you go through in life

661
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,195
should come out in the way that you dance.

662
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,281
I haven't found that to be the case
with my dancing.

663
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,450
It's a shame.

664
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,495
David, hate to interrupt.

665
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,497
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to see you again, Elise.

666
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,916
- How did you find me?
- Does it matter?

667
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,918
Nice work.

668
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,421
There's a crowd of people
waiting for your announcement speech

669
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,547
at the Brooklyn Bridge right now.

670
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,674
You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.

671
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,343
I know. I told you I'm not going to
let you out of my sight.

672
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,304
- David, what the hell?
- Do you want to come?

673
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:57,141
- Do you want to watch?
- No. I can't, I have to go and rehearse.

674
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,018
Actually, I just heard that
they're moving my rehearsal

675
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,769
to Pier 17, right next to the bridge.

676
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,731
Why don't we just postpone it?
We'll do the speech another time.

677
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,358
- No, David, come on, you can't do that.
- Thank you.

678
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,735
- You have to go.
- Check.

679
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,112
David, she's rehearsing so close.

680
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,031
It'll take you three minutes
to get there after the speech.

681
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:15,117
- All right.
- Just come over when you're done.

682
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,870
Keep the change. Thank you.

683
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:21,081
Have Charlie's aide call him now.

684
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,210
Are you sure you don't want a ride?

685
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:25,878
No, I have to go home and change.

686
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,589
You're so late.
Your friend is about to cry.

687
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,049
I'm wrangling him right now.

688
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,092
Yeah, I know.

689
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,013
Shifting her rehearsal to Pier 17
was a genius move.

690
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:38,098
We're not out of the woods yet.

691
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:39,808
Come over when you're done.

692
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,396
- David.
- Okay.

693
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,941
Sorry, the TV crew is there.
We got to go, man.

694
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:54,323
We're okay.

695
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,995
Look, whatever happens, I'm not going to let
anything come between us again.

696
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,873
Okay.

697
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,417
I'll see you soon.

698
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,177
Hey, how you doing?

699
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,097
Thank you. Appreciate it.

700
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,765
How are you?

701
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,477
Thanks a lot. Good to see you too.

702
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,023
Thank you.

703
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,571
I have to say,
it's good to be back in Brooklyn.

704
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,534
There's been a lot of speculation

705
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,160
- as to whether or not...
- It's done.

706
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:42,663
I would run for a Senate seat here
in the state of New York.

707
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,291
I came here today
to put an end to that speculation

708
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:47,293
and to tell you, unequivocally,

709
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:51,463
I will seek the Senate seat
for the great state of New York.

710
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,511
David! David!

711
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,732
Shit.

712
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:15,362
Don't forget, I added the bankers' group
after The Daily Show tomorrow.

713
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,490
Are you listening to me?

714
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:21,910
David?

715
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,917
I cannot get a break on this case.

716
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:36,717
Okay. I got to get to Pier 17.

717
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,886
Do the interview
and you can do whatever you want.

718
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:40,846
Just handle the interviews for me.
I'll talk to those guys...

719
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:43,766
- This has got to go on the nightly news.
- I got to see Elise right now.

720
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:47,061
Every time we get close,
you do something to mess this up.

721
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,605
This is different.

722
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:15,130
- City, please?
- Manhattan.

723
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,509
- What listing?
- Cedar Lake. It's a dance company.

724
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,553
Connecting.

725
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,902
He's going to ask the parking attendant
to use the hard line.

726
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,487
I already killed it.

727
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,532
Excuse me, can I use your phone?
I have an emergency.

728
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,498
Restaurant across the street.

729
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,210
I took out everything for three blocks.

730
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,003
This guy is a pain in the ass.

731
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,965
Come on, let's go talk to him.

732
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,803
There is a whole world of women out there.

733
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,763
I thought we established
this one was off limits.

734
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:07,975
It's been a while, I must have forgotten.

735
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,018
Doesn't change the fact.

736
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:13,063
You put us together three times.

737
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:15,816
That wasn't us, that was just chance.

738
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:17,818
Why do you want to keep us apart?

739
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,153
Because the plan says so.

740
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:20,779
Then you misread the plan.

741
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:23,115
There is no misreading the plan
when it comes to you and Elise.

742
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,324
Then the plan is wrong.

743
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:25,784
- Do you know who wrote it?
- I don't care.

744
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:29,163
You should.
You should really show a little respect.

745
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,878
If I'm not supposed to be with her,
how come I feel like this?

746
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,088
It doesn't matter how you feel.

747
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,549
What matters is what is in black and white.

748
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,683
You don't know why I'm not
supposed to be with her, do you?

749
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:54,021
That's why you can't tell me.
You don't know.

750
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,566
Who is this guy?

751
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,987
Excuse me, everyone.

752
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,324
Sorry to disturb your lunch.
It's an emergency.

753
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,578
Has anyone here ever seen a performance
at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company?

754
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,331
The Cedar Lake Ballet Company?

755
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,499
Yeah, I have.

756
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:14,708
Where is it?

757
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,418
Son of a bitch.

758
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,679
Hey, taxi. Hey!

759
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:34,269
Taxi! Hey!

760
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:42,444
Taxi!

761
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,615
Maybe you should try the subway.

762
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:49,409
Don't all these taxies you're diverting
have plans too?

763
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:53,163
How long you going to keep that up?
Twenty minutes? An hour?

764
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,958
Wow, the ripples must just be endless.

765
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:59,628
I don't care what you put in my way,
I'm not giving up.

766
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,509
Hey! Hey! Hey!

767
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,556
Taxi!

768
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,015
Hey!

769
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,690
You all right?

770
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:25,112
- You okay?
- What happened?

771
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:27,155
You got hit. Are you okay?

772
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,740
- I think so.
- Don't move.

773
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,745
You all right?

774
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:38,041
Hello, I just witnessed an accident

775
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,252
on the corner of Water and Dover Street.

776
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,462
Unfortunately,
you're the only witness, Congressman.

777
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:45,465
- But we did this three times already.
- I just need a few more details.

778
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,593
Oh, I see.

779
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,636
You're not even a cop, are you?
You're one of them.

780
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,555
- Calm down.
- Okay.

781
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,056
Someone could have been killed.

782
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,766
Sir, if you would just calm down.

783
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,143
Hey, Sergeant.

784
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,604
Hi. Sorry, excuse me,
I know you need a statement from me,

785
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,606
but do I need to stay here
or can I do it over the phone?

786
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,441
No, sir, we know
how to get in touch with you.

787
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:05,360
Okay. Now, is this man
under your command?

788
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:08,196
Never mind. Thank you.

789
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,834
Hey, hey, hey!

790
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,754
You want to make a quick 100 bucks?

791
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:26,340
You're going to have to break
a couple of traffic laws.

792
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:29,968
All right, 26th and 10th.
It's a ballet company called Cedar Lake.

793
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,391
Go through that.

794
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,143
Look out!

795
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,561
Watch it.

796
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,190
This is going to keep happening,
just go through.

797
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,986
Son of a bitch!

798
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,782
- Set a traffic jam on Broadway.
- Too many ripples.

799
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,116
He's getting out of range.

800
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,702
I don't know what to do with this.
You're reaching your limit.

801
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,246
Hey!

802
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,457
Excuse me.

803
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:07,631
Two down. Two down.

804
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:10,842
Oh, shit!

805
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:12,260
Next one.

806
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,096
I hate downtown.

807
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:24,773
Sorry.

808
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,194
I've got inflection points.

809
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:32,030
All he needs to do is see her dance
and you're at your ripple limit.

810
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:34,199
What?
All right, block the door.

811
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,367
He's already through it.

812
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,702
Not that one, the next one.

813
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,953
Excuse me.

814
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,788
David Norris, I'm here to see Elise.

815
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,665
I'm blocking them all.

816
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,501
Hat! Hat!

817
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:46,712
- Is she here?
- Yeah, she's in the studio.

818
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,302
It's too late. He's already seen her.

819
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,556
You hit your ripple limit.

820
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,933
Celebrate now.

821
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,227
They're just going to kick it upstairs.

822
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,812
It's Donaldson.

823
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:11,862
He has no idea what he's up against.

824
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,034
Let's take a walk.

825
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:07,626
The intense chemistry between them,

826
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,586
the constant inflection points,

827
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:12,297
and the kicker, you pulling them apart twice

828
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,050
only to have chance put them back together.

829
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:17,594
Yeah, all that seemed a little much.

830
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:21,473
So, I asked Burdensky
to do some research this morning.

831
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,559
Have you been in here before?

832
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:26,311
No, of course not.

833
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,689
It seems like David Norris and Elise Sellas
were meant to be together

834
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:32,609
because they were meant to be together.

835
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,736
Wait, what?

836
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,531
In the '70s when he was born,
they were meant to be together,

837
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:39,991
same thing in the '80s, '90s.

838
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:42,619
Wasn't till 2005 that the plan changed

839
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,872
and she was supposed to stay with Adrian.

840
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:54,923
The problem here is there are remnants
from all those old plans

841
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,509
that keep pushing them together.

842
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,762
They still feel like they belong
with each other even though they don't,

843
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:03,557
and we're about to tear them apart again.

844
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:19,865
You spend your whole career

845
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:23,201
hoping, someday,
you'll get a red-letter case.

846
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,705
Something you can really
make a name for yourself with.

847
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,499
Finally you get one,

848
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,042
and it's booby-trapped.

849
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:32,794
What?

850
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:35,630
I'm saying, it wasn't your fault.

851
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,425
They were meant to be together.

852
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,885
What?

853
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:42,470
Were. In an earlier version of the plan.

854
00:53:42,554 --> 00:53:44,806
Actually, a dozen earlier versions.

855
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,269
I always wondered
how we had such bad luck

856
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:53,982
that she was on that particular bus
on that particular day.

857
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:56,651
How could a plan just change like that?

858
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:58,653
I don't know.

859
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:01,448
It's above my pay grade.

860
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:03,325
So, we're going operational.

861
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:04,910
This is exciting. It's been a while.

862
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,496
We're not going operational.

863
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:13,001
No one ever made it to my job
by taking stupid risks.

864
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,794
So, what are we going to do?

865
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:16,713
We're going to kick this case upstairs

866
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:19,799
to someone with the latitude
to clean up this mess

867
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:21,468
without breaking into a sweat.

868
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,637
We're going to bring this to Thompson.

869
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,597
Thompson?

870
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,766
When he was in the field,
his nickname was...

871
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,559
The Hammer, yes.

872
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:32,896
He'll crush this little romance
with a flick of his hand

873
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,606
and force them back on plan again.

874
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,650
I want to go to a club.

875
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,777
Why ruin a really nice day?

876
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,612
- Come on.
- No, I don't dance.

877
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,615
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.

878
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,409
Well, I've been told
that I have trouble feeling.

879
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:47,953
Who told you that?

880
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,955
A long list of women.

881
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,206
That's gross.

882
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,540
You know what?

883
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:55,085
Let's race to that lamppost.

884
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,587
You win, I dance for you.

885
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:01,132
I win, you dance for me.

886
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,759
On the pole?

887
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,135
If you like, yeah.

888
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:05,971
This is serious. What are the rules?

889
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:07,389
There are no rules.

890
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,766
You bastard! Oh, my gosh!

891
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,145
You challenged me in those shoes?

892
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,772
Okay, fine. I can't.

893
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:18,483
You're right. These are the wrong shoes.
I'm going to twist an ankle.

894
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,610
You said, no rules. I avoided them.

895
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,032
You said you had trouble feeling.

896
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:28,868
Great.

897
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,543
Hey, David.

898
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,671
- You're even cuter in person.
- Hey, it's David Norris.

899
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:42,549
How you doing? How are you?

900
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,300
How are we feeling about this tie?

901
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:46,928
- Hey, David Norris!
- Hey, how you doing?

902
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,555
Maybe I should go home and get my tux.

903
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:51,099
Definitely don't do that. It's good.

904
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:54,602
I should never have come back
here again without my backup dancers.

905
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:00,984
- I voted for you.
- How are you?

906
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,413
Norris, you're a rock star!

907
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,379
Did you grow up over here?

908
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:25,091
Yeah, three blocks over that way.
Pioneer Street.

909
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:26,384
My whole childhood.

910
00:56:26,468 --> 00:56:29,095
What were you like as a kid?

911
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:33,183
I've spent about half my time in the
principal's office up until the sixth grade.

912
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:37,353
Yeah, that was when
my mother and my brother died

913
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:38,813
within a month of each other.

914
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:41,816
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

915
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:46,071
You know how I always tell that story
about how I got inspired to go into politics

916
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:51,076
because my dad took me to the Senate Gallery
and we sat together and that's true.

917
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,078
But what I leave out is

918
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,163
he did that right after they died.

919
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:58,416
And I was bottoming out.

920
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:02,420
So, he wanted to get me out of here
for a little while

921
00:57:02,504 --> 00:57:07,509
and he planned this road trip to DC,
and I think it's because JFK was his idol.

922
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:10,762
And we went and sat in the gallery.

923
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:15,183
I remember watching him watch them,

924
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:18,228
and I knew that that's what I wanted to do.

925
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:22,732
I wish they were here to see all this.

926
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:27,821
I was...

927
00:57:31,783 --> 00:57:34,410
Didn't expect to tell you any of that.

928
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,196
David?

929
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,240
David?

930
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,291
- Hello?
- It's Adrian.

931
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,544
Hey.

932
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:10,173
What are you doing?
Why are you calling?

933
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,467
Hi.

934
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,802
No, I was...

935
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,305
Because I was sleeping.

936
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:20,725
No.

937
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,393
No, it's not.

938
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,479
Why are you calling?

939
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:29,400
Okay, well, I got to go.

940
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:32,487
No, I got to go. Okay.

941
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:36,616
I'm so sorry.

942
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:39,410
- It's all right. Everything okay?
- Yeah.

943
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:44,499
Oh, my God. That was so weird.
I woke up and you weren't here.

944
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:47,794
And then the phone rang
and it was my ex

945
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:50,338
which is just so strange.

946
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,298
Sorry, I guess we hadn't gotten
to any of that stuff yet.

947
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:53,466
Right.

948
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,177
You know, we broke up a while ago,

949
00:59:56,261 --> 00:59:59,889
and it's over and then he calls
four times in one morning.

950
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,394
He called you four times this morning?

951
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,732
How long have you guys been broken up?

952
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:12,819
Three months.

953
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:16,030
It's like he knew I was with someone else.

954
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:22,954
- Was it serious?
- We were engaged.

955
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,291
So, not really that serious?

956
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:27,709
Right.

957
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,378
Well, what happened?

958
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,799
- Do you want to know this?
- Yeah.

959
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:40,805
He was a great guy.

960
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:43,766
Brilliant choreographer and dancer,

961
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:47,895
and we had the same group of friends.

962
01:00:47,979 --> 01:00:50,398
We had known each other a long time.

963
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:56,404
Well, he sounds great.
Why didn't you marry him?

964
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:02,869
Because of you.

965
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:09,876
I'm not some hopeless romantic.
I've never allowed myself to be that way.

966
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:13,588
But once I felt,

967
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:17,091
even for a moment,
what I felt with you.

968
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:23,431
You ruined me.
I didn't want to settle for less.

969
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,392
I know the feeling.

970
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:29,020
It scares the shit out of me.

971
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,105
I'm not going to hurt you.

972
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:34,025
You don't need to say that.

973
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,194
I'm not going to hurt you.

974
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:42,575
This is the first time

975
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:46,579
in 25 years that I don't feel
like I'm by myself.

976
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:48,998
That's a lot
of responsibility for me.

977
01:01:49,082 --> 01:01:52,126
I don't know if I'm quite comfortable
with that.

978
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:55,671
Well, too late.

979
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,639
You know, I'm supposed to go
to an interview right now.

980
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:10,520
What if I told you I wasn't
ready to let you out of my sight quite yet?

981
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,772
- Sounds good.
- You want to go?

982
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:14,774
- Yeah.
- All right.

983
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,652
Are you handsome

984
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:21,697
or is it that
Washington is so populated by

985
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:25,076
I don't want to say,
hideous abnormalities...

986
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,744
This is getting a little weird.

987
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,289
David Norris, everybody.

988
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,673
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

989
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,800
Congressman Norris asked me
to give you a message.

990
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,009
He was just called into a meeting.

991
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,428
- He says it's urgent.
- Okay.

992
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:46,431
He said he'll call you as soon as he's out
and he'll see you at the show tonight.

993
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,724
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

994
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,526
This way, Congressman.

995
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,960
Hello?

996
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:22,717
Frustrating, isn't it?

997
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,803
My name is Thompson.

998
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:29,974
Whatever happened to free will?

999
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,768
We actually tried free will before.

1000
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:37,106
After taking you from hunting and gathering
to the height of the Roman Empire,

1001
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:41,903
we stepped back to see
how you would do on your own.

1002
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:46,657
You gave us the Dark Ages
for five centuries

1003
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:49,827
until finally we decided
we should come back in.

1004
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:53,789
The Chairman thought that maybe
we just needed to do a better job

1005
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:57,835
with teaching you how to ride a bike
before taking the training wheels off again.

1006
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:03,508
So, we gave you the Renaissance,
the Enlightenment, scientific revolution.

1007
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:07,678
For 600 years we taught you
to control your impulses with reason.

1008
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:12,141
Then in 1910, we stepped back again.

1009
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:16,938
Within 50 years,
you had brought us World War I,

1010
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:21,025
the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust,

1011
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,820
and capped it off by bringing
the entire planet to the brink of destruction

1012
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,614
in the Cuban missile crisis.

1013
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,575
At that point a decision was taken
to step back in again

1014
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:33,788
before you did something
that even we couldn't fix.

1015
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,959
You don't have free will, David.

1016
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:42,004
You have the appearance of free will.

1017
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:45,132
You expect me to believe that?
I make decisions every day.

1018
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:49,679
You have free will over which toothpaste
you use or which beverage to order at lunch.

1019
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:54,934
But humanity just isn't mature enough
to control the important things.

1020
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,061
So, you handle the important things?

1021
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,605
The last time I checked,
the world is a pretty screwed-up place.

1022
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:01,983
It's still here.

1023
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,652
If we had left things in your hands,
it wouldn't be.

1024
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:09,156
Tell me why I can't be with Elise?
Because the last guy didn't know.

1025
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,035
Meeting Elise at the Waldorf
three years ago wasn't chance.

1026
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,537
That was us.

1027
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,456
We knew she would inspire you
to give that speech.

1028
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,668
That speech that brought you back
from the edge of oblivion

1029
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:24,630
and overnight made you the frontrunner
in this coming election.

1030
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:26,966
What are you saying?
You want me to win the election?

1031
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:30,303
This one and four more after it.

1032
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:34,307
And I'm not just talking about elections
for Senate.

1033
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:38,436
You can matter, David. Really matter.

1034
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:43,858
What your father wanted when he took you
to the Senate Gallery when you were 10.

1035
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:47,945
What your brother wanted when he made
you promise the day before he overdosed

1036
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:50,114
that you wouldn't be like him.

1037
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:54,869
Why do you think you have that yearning
to be in front of people?

1038
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,373
That terrible emptiness when you're not.

1039
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:00,875
Don't do that.

1040
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,461
David, you can change the world,

1041
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:06,881
but that doesn't happen
if you stay with her.

1042
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,175
Why do you people care who I love?

1043
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:12,219
It's not about her, it's about you.

1044
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:15,014
What being with her does to you.

1045
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,515
What it does to me?

1046
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,850
I'm better when I'm with her!

1047
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,644
Even you said it. The speech.

1048
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:22,813
In small doses, Elise was the cure.

1049
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,565
But in large doses,

1050
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:27,026
- she rubs off on you.
- Stop.

1051
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:30,988
David, the president can't be a loose cannon.

1052
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,573
Stop talking. It's not working.

1053
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:36,577
Why do you refuse to accept
what should be completely obvious by now?

1054
01:06:36,661 --> 01:06:38,871
You've seen what we can do.

1055
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:41,749
You can't doubt we are who we say we are.

1056
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:49,757
Look, it's not about who you are,
it's about who I am.

1057
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,551
Can't outrun your fate, David.

1058
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:56,055
I just disagree with you
about what my fate is.

1059
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:01,018
I know what I feel for her
and it's not going to change.

1060
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:05,940
All I have are the choices that I make.

1061
01:07:06,816 --> 01:07:08,150
And I choose her

1062
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,778
come what may.

1063
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,868
It's 6:20.

1064
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:21,455
If you leave now,
you can make Elise's show.

1065
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:34,945
She's a beautiful dancer.

1066
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:38,449
I thought I made myself clear.

1067
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:41,869
There is one more piece to this
I haven't mentioned.

1068
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,081
I guess I just didn't have the heart.

1069
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:55,382
If you stay with her,
it not only kills your dreams, it kills hers.

1070
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:58,427
What?

1071
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:03,307
Elise is about to become one of
the most famous dancers in the country

1072
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,976
and eventually one of the world's
greatest choreographers.

1073
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:11,982
If she stays with you, she ends up
teaching dance to six-year-olds.

1074
01:09:27,623 --> 01:09:31,627
When you look back at all this, David,
just remember

1075
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:35,422
we tried to reason with you.

1076
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:49,330
I always hear people saying,

1077
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:54,335
you can't blame yourself
for what happens to other people,

1078
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:57,880
but in this case, really, you can.

1079
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,474
This is what you do, David.

1080
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:12,978
This is what you did getting into a bar fight
the night you first got elected.

1081
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:16,523
What you did to get that embarrassing photo
in The New York Post.

1082
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:20,778
We give you opportunities
other people would kill for

1083
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:23,530
and you squander them with impulse.

1084
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:27,034
It doesn't take a genius to see Elise

1085
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:30,704
isn't exactly helping you with this.

1086
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:34,166
It's a sprain, David,

1087
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:38,462
but if you stay with her, you'll take
away the only thing she ever cared about.

1088
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:39,755
It's up to you.

1089
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:02,778
- It's just a sprain.
- Yeah.

1090
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:05,823
The doctor said it's going to
be better in a month or less.

1091
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:08,492
That's totally unexpected.

1092
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:10,369
I'm so relieved.

1093
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,329
Great. Great.

1094
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:16,542
You're such a great dancer,

1095
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,921
and you'll heal up
and just get better and better.

1096
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,518
- I'm going to go make a couple phone calls.
- Okay.

1097
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,106
Okay.

1098
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,567
I'm so happy for you.

1099
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:17,352
It's done.
Thompson finished it.

1100
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,271
I know.

1101
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,734
You can't let it get to you

1102
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:26,653
like it did with his family.

1103
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:29,406
This is the job.

1104
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:39,333
You ever wonder

1105
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,294
if it's right?

1106
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,546
I mean,

1107
01:13:45,297 --> 01:13:47,424
if it's always right?

1108
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:51,386
Not like I used to.

1109
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:54,681
Look, Chairman has the plan.

1110
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:56,558
We only see part of it.

1111
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:25,087
I was talking to some friends of ours
over in Monroe County this morning,

1112
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,214
and I said something to them that I think

1113
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:30,300
a lot of you may have heard me say before
but it bears repeating.

1114
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:34,346
David Norris, who has spent the last
two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area

1115
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:37,975
received some welcome news yesterday
when the latest New York Times poll

1116
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:40,477
gave him a 16-point lead over his opponent

1117
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,855
less than a month before election day.

1118
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:47,651
Since his announcement 11 months ago,
Norris has had a significant lead...

1119
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,279
Hi. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1120
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,322
Yeah, thank you. I need it. Thank you.

1121
01:14:52,406 --> 01:14:54,658
- Who should I make it out to?
- My nephew, Miles.

1122
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,160
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

1123
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:58,245
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

1124
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:01,248
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Pleasure.

1125
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:04,585
- Can we get a picture with you?
- Sure, come on.

1126
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:06,461
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1127
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,592
Hey.

1128
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:14,678
I want to show you this,
because you would find out eventually.

1129
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,513
I want to be here when you do.

1130
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:24,438
She's getting married
to that guy she was engaged to.

1131
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,775
You okay?

1132
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,153
I think I'm going to...

1133
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:32,946
Take a day off.

1134
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,699
Hell, take a couple. We're 16 points up.

1135
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,577
Yeah, even I can't blow a lead that big.

1136
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:49,690
Congressman,
good to see you again.

1137
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:53,568
Your friend just left you this.
He said you would be stopping by.

1138
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:16,717
Why would you want to see me?

1139
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:21,263
Thompson was lying when he said

1140
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:24,224
you couldn't be with Elise because
she brings out your reckless side.

1141
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:27,561
Then why?
Why do they care so much?

1142
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:30,897
Because she's enough, David.

1143
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:34,985
If you have her, you won't need
to fill that void inside of you

1144
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,612
with applause and votes

1145
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:40,198
and dreams of one day making it
to the White House.

1146
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:43,994
That's important,
but it's not the only thing that matters.

1147
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:47,622
Why are you so different from them?

1148
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:58,592
Your dad...

1149
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,262
was a very smart man.

1150
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,768
He could have been a lot more.
Wanted to be.

1151
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:11,229
Your brother too.

1152
01:18:11,563 --> 01:18:13,940
But the plan didn't call for it.

1153
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,526
What about my mother?

1154
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,986
That wasn't me.

1155
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,447
That wasn't us at all.

1156
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:22,616
It was just chance?

1157
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,704
I'm sorry.

1158
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:33,919
You know, Thompson is not lying.

1159
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,757
They're already talking about me
being a presidential candidate.

1160
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,718
I'm phoning in my speeches
and I'm 16 points up.

1161
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:43,720
The public loves you.

1162
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:47,224
Before I met Elise, that's all I cared about.

1163
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,685
I don't even notice it now.

1164
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,777
I can't stop thinking about her.

1165
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:07,953
Do you know where she's getting married?

1166
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,083
In front of a judge tomorrow morning.

1167
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,252
Is she happy?

1168
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:20,590
Thompson won't let you anywhere near her.

1169
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:23,176
Not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever.

1170
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,970
Harry.

1171
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,097
Is she happy?

1172
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,769
I got to try and get her back.

1173
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:37,107
Will you help me?
Will you just help me get to her?

1174
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,359
They'll sense you coming a mile away.

1175
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:42,863
What if I could move as fast as you?

1176
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:46,032
Teach me about the doors.

1177
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,578
The rain will stop in the next hour,

1178
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,330
and that's the only thing keeping them
from seeing us right now.

1179
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:55,208
If we're going do this,
we'll need all night to do it

1180
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,961
and a place surrounded by water
to do it in.

1181
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,840
Always turn the doorknob clockwise.

1182
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:04,134
What happens if I turn it the other way?

1183
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:07,095
You don't want to do that.
That's only for us.

1184
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:09,931
Put your hand on my shoulder

1185
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:12,350
and don't let go
until we cross the threshold.

1186
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:13,852
Are these ever locked?

1187
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,396
Not when you're wearing one of our hats.

1188
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:22,235
Keep moving, David.

1189
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,409
Is this...

1190
01:20:29,743 --> 01:20:31,119
It's the Museum of Modern Art.

1191
01:20:31,203 --> 01:20:32,370
Yeah.

1192
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,091
Close the door.

1193
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:56,019
This is the city's main pumping station
for downtown Manhattan.

1194
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,438
We're 10 blocks from the courthouse.

1195
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:05,028
Wait here.

1196
01:21:23,213 --> 01:21:26,841
Hi, is the floor open?

1197
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:28,134
You okay, sweetie?

1198
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:30,220
Yeah, I just...

1199
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:34,266
I just feel like being on the floor.

1200
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,234
Lower Manhattan is layer upon layer
of substrate.

1201
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:47,404
That's what we call the doors
that have been added over time.

1202
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:51,866
Makes it a lot more complex to
navigate downtown than it is uptown

1203
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:53,326
and a lot slower.

1204
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:58,415
Your destination, 60 Centre Street,
Courtroom 300.

1205
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,215
There are thousands of different ways
to get to the courthouse using the doors.

1206
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,426
I want you to learn
how to stay in the substrate

1207
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:12,387
so Thompson won't be able
to get a fix on you.

1208
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:15,265
Okay.
Just south of the diner, it's a red door.

1209
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:17,934
I come out on Broadway,
right by Leonard Street.

1210
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:19,853
That's good. Keep going.

1211
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,188
From Leonard, half a block down.

1212
01:22:22,272 --> 01:22:23,898
Okay, suppose Thompson's there?

1213
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,359
Okay, I go east to Lafayette.

1214
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:28,111
No, it's Crosby Street there.

1215
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:30,280
Eight doors?
I'm zigzagging all over the place.

1216
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:31,448
That will take me too long.

1217
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,074
But every time you go through a door,

1218
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:35,869
their plan books will lose track of you,
so it's safer.

1219
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,247
Look, I need you to understand
this has never been done before.

1220
01:22:39,331 --> 01:22:42,792
So, the minute you go through that
first door, all hell will break loose.

1221
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:45,712
Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat.

1222
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:49,132
I don't care if it's a Yankee cap,
a bowler, or even a yarmulke.

1223
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:51,968
Assume everyone in a hat
is working with Thompson.

1224
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:54,763
Even you guys can't get through the doors
without your hats on, right?

1225
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:55,972
Right.

1226
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,433
It's one of the ways the Chairman
limits our power.

1227
01:22:58,516 --> 01:22:59,684
Water is another way.

1228
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:02,270
And you said before, what if Thompson's
in front of me on Crosby Street?

1229
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:03,396
Right.

1230
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,357
Why don't I just knock the hat off his head

1231
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,817
and then run by him
before he has time to pick it up?

1232
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:10,320
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.

1233
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:13,490
The fastest way is actually
if I go right for the blue door.

1234
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:15,492
Yeah, but then you're exposed
the entire way there.

1235
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:17,744
That's a lot more dangerous
than leapfrogging through doors.

1236
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:19,913
But if I make it,
I'll take them completely by surprise.

1237
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,039
If you make it.

1238
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:28,963
Come on, we have a lot more to get through.

1239
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:30,924
Whatever it takes.

1240
01:23:33,468 --> 01:23:36,221
Your father used to say that.

1241
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:46,189
I guess you're not supposed to
identify with your subjects.

1242
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:47,857
You're not supposed to feel guilt.

1243
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:51,695
We're not built to lead
with our emotions like you are,

1244
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:55,281
but that doesn't mean we don't have them.

1245
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,451
Some more than others.

1246
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,476
You're lucky, it started raining again.

1247
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,520
We need to get going.
The wedding is in 10 minutes.

1248
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:28,857
We have time.
Being early is just as bad as being late.

1249
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:33,445
Is your fiancée here?

1250
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,238
She's on her way in.

1251
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,324
Courtroom 300.

1252
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,330
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1253
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,379
- This is it.
- Okay.

1254
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:56,217
- I'm going to go for the blue door.
- Of course.

1255
01:24:58,303 --> 01:25:01,681
Here is your way through it.
Don't lose it.

1256
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:06,519
- Thanks, Harry.
- Good luck.

1257
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:13,276
Okay.

1258
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:34,380
It looks like Mr. Norris is using the rain
to make a run for it.

1259
01:25:34,464 --> 01:25:36,966
Call the proctor at the wedding.

1260
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:41,471
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just nervous, I guess.

1261
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:44,516
I just need a minute in the bathroom, okay?

1262
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:08,164
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.

1263
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:10,291
He just went into the substrate.

1264
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:29,352
No, no, no.

1265
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,354
It's an emergency. Sorry.

1266
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:34,190
Docket number 22, please come forward.

1267
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:37,360
- We're next. Will you go check on her?
- Yeah.

1268
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:45,785
- You're David Norris!
- Yeah, I got to go.

1269
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,292
- Nothing in the hat.
- Go ahead.

1270
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:09,559
She's not even in there.

1271
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:13,313
Where is she? Where is she?

1272
01:27:15,148 --> 01:27:16,733
Elise.

1273
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:20,236
You're not marrying that guy.

1274
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:24,240
I'm so sorry,

1275
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:27,493
and I don't know what you must
think of me, but you can't marry him.

1276
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,621
You don't love him.
I've been terrible, I know.

1277
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:31,748
- I'm getting married.
- No, you can't.

1278
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,083
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

1279
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,711
Do you know that no one has ever hurt me
as much as you did?

1280
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:38,588
I'm so sorry that I left you the way that I did.

1281
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:41,341
David, you know what?
You left me in a fucking hospital.

1282
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:42,508
What are you doing?

1283
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,594
I know it seems terrible
but there was a reason.

1284
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:47,805
You don't know anything about me
and what makes me happy.

1285
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,474
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1286
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:52,685
Oh, my God.

1287
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:54,687
Don't worry about him, he's with them.

1288
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:56,606
- Just listen to me.
- Oh, my God, what did you do?

1289
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,150
- Forget about him.
- What are you doing?

1290
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:02,612
Look at me, I know that you love me.

1291
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:09,661
Okay, this says that you love me

1292
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:12,205
and that I love you and that
we're not supposed to be together.

1293
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,456
Because of this book.

1294
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,501
But I know that I'm supposed to be
with you because of the way I feel.

1295
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:18,378
I love you and I don't care what happens.

1296
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:21,547
I want to spend the rest of my life with you
even if it's only a little while.

1297
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:25,093
He just revealed us.

1298
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,803
Call the Intervention Team.

1299
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:29,305
Tell them it's a square-one reset.

1300
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:38,314
Mr. Thompson has deployed
the Intervention Team.

1301
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:40,733
He's requesting an emergency
Reset Authorization.

1302
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:42,235
I'll carry it in.

1303
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:52,245
Why are they chasing you?

1304
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:56,416
They're going to reset me.

1305
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:57,959
What are you talking about?

1306
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:00,586
I never lied to you.

1307
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,171
Down here.

1308
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,674
He's down here.

1309
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:06,592
I love you, Elise.

1310
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:10,596
I'm going to show you something.

1311
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,724
You deserve to know.

1312
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:14,434
What's going on?

1313
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,446
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.

1314
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:58,561
Got them. Sixth Avenue.

1315
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:00,521
Contain this.

1316
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:04,859
Oh, my God. What's happening to me?

1317
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:07,070
All you need to know, we're being chased.

1318
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:09,363
I need you to trust me.

1319
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:10,531
I need you to trust me.

1320
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,784
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

1321
01:30:23,795 --> 01:30:25,505
Door, door, door!

1322
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:29,509
Find another door!

1323
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:35,848
What the hell is going on?

1324
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:37,683
What the hell is going on, David?

1325
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:38,810
Okay, I'm sorry.

1326
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:41,646
- How did we just do that?
- I'm so sorry.

1327
01:30:41,729 --> 01:30:44,107
These doors belong to the people
who are chasing us.

1328
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:46,234
- Who are they?
- I don't know what to call them,

1329
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,902
but they want to take you away from me.

1330
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:49,695
Why do they care about us?

1331
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:51,322
They hurt your ankle, Elise.

1332
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:54,951
Everything you've worked for your entire life,
it doesn't happen if you stay with me.

1333
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:58,579
- That's why I left you in the hospital.
- I don't understand.

1334
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:01,582
I don't understand.

1335
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,001
This can't be wrong.

1336
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:08,047
This can't be wrong.

1337
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,884
Why do they think it's wrong?

1338
01:31:11,968 --> 01:31:14,804
The book... Their book.

1339
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:16,722
But what if I can find who wrote it?

1340
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:26,941
Okay, I can go through this door alone.

1341
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:29,610
You'll never see me
or the people chasing us again.

1342
01:31:32,405 --> 01:31:36,450
Or you could come with me,
and I don't know what's on the other side,

1343
01:31:37,118 --> 01:31:38,494
but I know you would be next to me,

1344
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:40,580
and that's all I've wanted
since the minute I met you.

1345
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:54,051
I'm coming with you.

1346
01:31:58,014 --> 01:31:59,557
Okay.

1347
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:03,477
Take the other one.

1348
01:32:04,437 --> 01:32:06,022
Turn it to the left.

1349
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07,607
To the left.

1350
01:32:16,824 --> 01:32:18,075
Oh, my God.

1351
01:32:37,428 --> 01:32:39,347
Hey! You can't be in here.

1352
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,890
Stop, sir!

1353
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:42,892
Hold them up!

1354
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,312
Come on.

1355
01:32:48,522 --> 01:32:49,857
Stop them!

1356
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:18,219
Harry Mitchell,
they want you in the Chairman's office.

1357
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:19,845
Immediately.

1358
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,992
Come on.

1359
01:33:54,547 --> 01:33:55,715
Hey! Hey!

1360
01:33:56,132 --> 01:33:58,092
How did you get in here?

1361
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:17,903
Search the room!

1362
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:35,963
Shit!

1363
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:38,174
Go back.

1364
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:04,617
No.

1365
01:35:05,743 --> 01:35:06,786
Oh, my God.

1366
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:15,628
- I love you.
- I love you.

1367
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:04,009
Did you really think
you could reach the Chairman?

1368
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,512
And change your fate if you did?

1369
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:09,014
Or write your own?

1370
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:12,017
It doesn't work like that and I told you why.

1371
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:17,481
I've got a message for you.

1372
01:36:26,866 --> 01:36:28,367
I understand.

1373
01:36:38,127 --> 01:36:40,171
Even Thompson has a boss.

1374
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:41,881
Harry?

1375
01:36:45,176 --> 01:36:48,012
- You're the Chairman?
- No.

1376
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,764
You've met him though, or her.

1377
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:52,349
Everybody has.

1378
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,519
The Chairman comes in a different form
to everyone

1379
01:36:55,603 --> 01:36:58,272
so people rarely realize when it happens.

1380
01:37:01,275 --> 01:37:04,528
Is this some sort of test?

1381
01:37:04,612 --> 01:37:06,906
In a way, it's all a test,

1382
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:11,327
for everybody, even the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.

1383
01:37:12,578 --> 01:37:15,664
David, you risked everything for Elise.

1384
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:18,667
And Elise, when you came through that door
at the Statue of Liberty,

1385
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:20,169
you risked everything too.

1386
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:23,380
But you inspired me.

1387
01:37:23,464 --> 01:37:25,799
It seems like you inspired the Chairman too.

1388
01:37:28,928 --> 01:37:31,931
- Is that about us?
- Yes.

1389
01:37:33,557 --> 01:37:34,892
What does it say?

1390
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,061
It says that this situation
between the two of you

1391
01:37:37,144 --> 01:37:39,897
is a serious deviation from the plan.

1392
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:45,277
So, the Chairman rewrote it.

1393
01:37:53,536 --> 01:37:54,620
Okay.

1394
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,498
Now what?

1395
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,916
Now...

1396
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:05,047
You can take the stairs.

1397
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:20,479
Most people live life
on the path we set for them.

1398
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:23,357
Too afraid to explore any other.

1399
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,444
But once in a while,
people like you come along

1400
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:31,198
who knock down all the obstacles
we put in your way.

1401
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:35,452
People who realize free will is a gift
you'll never know how to use

1402
01:38:35,536 --> 01:38:37,454
until you fight for it.

1403
01:38:38,497 --> 01:38:41,208
I think that's the Chairman's real plan,

1404
01:38:41,292 --> 01:38:42,960
that maybe one day

1405
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,338
we won't write the plan.

1406
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,591
You will.
