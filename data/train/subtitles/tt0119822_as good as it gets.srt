1
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,617
I'm just gonna get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:37,872
It's tulip season today and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,127
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,714
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,265
Yes, come on. Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,684
Come on, sweetie. Come on. Come on.

7
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,813
Let's go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

8
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,398
Come on.

9
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:08,653
Come on, go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

10
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,197
No! Freeze! Freeze.

11
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,283
Leg down. Leg down. Leg down.

12
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:18,537
That's it. That's it. Come on, now.

13
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,707
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

14
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,877
No! You monkey-eared son of a...

15
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:29,215
You have pissed your last floor.

16
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,135
I'll bet you wish you were a real...

17
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,099
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

18
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:43,688
This is New York. If you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere.

19
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,607
You relentless, smelly, little...

20
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,615
Verdell?

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,245
Verdell? Verdell?

22
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,999
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

23
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,335
Come here, sweetheart.

24
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,505
Mr. Udall?

25
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:17,763
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

26
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,019
My dog. You know, my...

27
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,064
My dog with the little, adorable face.

28
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't you know what my dog looks like?

29
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,446
I got it. You were talking about your dog.

30
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,949
I thought it was the name
of that colored man in the halls.

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,619
Which color was that?

32
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,499
Like thick molasses with a broad nose.

33
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,961
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

34
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,548
- Frank!
- Simon, you have got to get dressed.

35
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,426
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.
- How you doing?

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,347
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
Yeah, I think you know that.

37
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,473
People are coming...

38
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,894
What I know is, as long as you keep
your work zipped up around me,

39
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,022
I don't care what
or where you shove your show.

40
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,858
Are we done being neighbors for now?

41
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,115
- Let me talk to you...
- No, no, no! Not worth it.

42
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,327
Definitely not.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

43
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,788
Okay.

44
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,043
Hope you find him. Love that dog.

45
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,506
You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.

46
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,903
One, two, three, four, five.

47
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,199
One, two, three, four, five.

48
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,161
One, two, three, four, five.

49
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,329
Okay.

50
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,643
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

51
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,913
- Oh, Carl, Carl. Hi, Carl.
- Frank.

52
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,207
- Where is he?
- He's here, isn't he? He lives here.

53
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,543
Take it easy. He had a thing with the dog.

54
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,463
- He's not such a hot-looking dog.
- He's adorable.

55
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,970
Good Lord. My honey. Where have you been?

56
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,225
Look at my boy. Look at him.

57
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,025
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

58
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,195
Where was my baby? Where was my baby?

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,990
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

60
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:32,208
- You earned your fun, John.
- Sorry. It just struck me as funny.

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,417
Oh, wait.

62
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:40,007
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator...

63
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,345
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him
down the garbage chute.

64
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:53,979
"Somewhere in the dark,
she had confessed and he had forgiven.

65
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,899
This is what you live for, he said.

66
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,819
Two heads on a pillow.
Where all is approval.

67
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:05,741
And there is only the safety
of being with each other.

68
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:11,664
How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?"

69
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:16,794
- Mr. Udall!
- "At last, she was able to define love."

70
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,005
"Love was..."

71
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:24,510
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

72
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,014
- "Love was..."
- Are you in there?

73
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,267
Son of a bitch!

74
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,686
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

75
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,187
Yes?

76
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,525
Maybe this can wait. I...

77
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,612
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

78
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,329
Well, that's a load off.

79
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,542
Did you do something to him?

80
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,212
Do you realize that I work at home?

81
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,548
No, I wasn't aware.

82
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:07,803
Do you like to be interrupted
when you're nancing around in your garden?

83
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:14,768
No, no, I actually will turn
the ringer off on my phone.

84
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,147
- And put a piece of cardboard...
- I work all the time.

85
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,152
So never, never interrupt me, okay?

86
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:28,073
Not if there's a fire, not if you hear
the sound of a thud from my home

87
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:33,078
and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body

88
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:39,001
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

89
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,338
Even then, don't come knocking.

90
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,674
Or if it's election night

91
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:50,596
and you wanna celebrate
because some fudge-packer that you date

92
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,099
has been elected
the first queer president.

93
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:58,395
And he's going
to have you down to Camp David...

94
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,691
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

95
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:08,364
Even then, don't knock. Not on this door.

96
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,784
Not for any reason.

97
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,871
Do you get me, sweetheart?

98
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:24,046
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

99
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,340
Okay, then.

100
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,524
So now he will think twice
before messing with me.

101
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,031
All right.

102
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,494
"Love was..."

103
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,541
What was love?

104
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,837
"Love was..."

105
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,762
Now I'm pissed. Now I am really pissed!

106
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,975
Don't touch! Don't touch! Don't touch!

107
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,896
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

108
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,984
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

109
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,654
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!

110
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,825
Help me! Help me! Help me!

111
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,287
Assault and battery! And you're Black!

112
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,916
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,171
if you verbally abuse him
or so much as touch that dog again.

114
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:55,888
Meantime, I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

115
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,392
I hate doing this! I'm an art dealer.

116
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,103
Have a nice day.

117
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,564
Okay, party!

118
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,691
Party!

119
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,670
- Excuse me.
- Don't touch. Don't touch.

120
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,380
Get a life.

121
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,593
- Hey, watch it.
- Don't touch!

122
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,604
- Look at you. You're all better.
- New medication.

123
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,149
You know all my son's stuff?
No, I got a date tonight.

124
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:53,987
I'm walking out the door, he says to me,
"Mom, I promise not to get a cough.”

125
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,157
- Oh, isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

126
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,243
- Go ahead, tell me.
- Eat everything.

127
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,870
I said, "You love me the way
you love your remote control,

128
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,581
as long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

129
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,625
- That's great. Terrific.
- I know.

130
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,546
People that talk in metaphors ought
to shampoo my crotch.

131
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,300
- Eat up!
- Stay there, I've got your money.

132
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,553
- You pay me next week.
- No, I owe you.

133
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,556
I told you today, that's the rule.
Excuse me, Melvin.

134
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,516
- Oh, don't... Don't...
- Excuse me.

135
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,521
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

136
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,400
Pardon me.

137
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,737
Pardon me. Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

138
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,324
Take a cab home, so you have time
to get ready for the date.

139
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,159
Ready is not my problem.

140
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:47,124
- I'm starving.
- Go on. You're not allowed back here.

141
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,001
Spence is more excited about it than I am.

142
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,880
He says, "Mom, I promise
not to get a fever during your date."

143
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,424
Sometimes, these kids, you just wanna...

144
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:01,013
- I've got Jews at my table.
- It's not your table. It's the place's.

145
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,224
Behave. You can sit
at someone else's station.

146
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,227
Or you can wait your turn.

147
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,153
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

148
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,822
How much more have you got to eat?

149
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,079
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

150
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,374
- What?
- That's it. Forget it, that's it.

151
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,668
- Let me talk to him.
- Let's go.

152
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,838
- Give him one more chance.
- No, barred for life.

153
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,173
Here I go. Here I go.

154
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,811
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

155
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:58,737
Bryan says if you ever act
like this again, you're barred for life.

156
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

157
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,577
Three eggs, over easy.

158
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,624
- Two sausage, six bacon, with fries.
- Fries today?

159
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,878
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

160
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,631
You'll die soon with that diet, you know.

161
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:22,886
We're all gonna die. I will, you will,
and it sure sounds like your son will.

162
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,281
If you ever mention my son again,

163
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,369
you will never be able to eat here again.
Do you understand?

164
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,339
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

165
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:06,638
Do you understand me, you crazy fuck?

166
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,644
Do you?

167
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,447
Yes.

168
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,074
Yes.

169
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,039
Okay, I'll get your order.

170
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,834
Wear my earrings tonight.

171
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:45,052
It's just so interesting what you said.
You said it like it was nothing.

172
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,261
I mean, if you...

173
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:55,896
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it. I sort of...

174
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,106
I sort of sleep in here.

175
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,701
Don't worry about it.

176
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,852
What?

177
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,731
I don't know.

178
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,118
Grandma. Grandma!

179
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,413
- Maybe you better check.
- What'd you think I was gonna do?

180
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,962
- I'm sorry.
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

181
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,965
I was hearing everything
that you were doing,

182
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,510
so I put these on to give you privacy.

183
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,970
So how was dinner?

184
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,348
- Hey, pal.
- How was your friend?

185
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,058
- Are you okay?
- Not bad.

186
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,978
You got a temperature? Scootch over.

187
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,773
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

188
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,902
Carol, I have him.

189
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,408
- One more spit?
- Carol, I said, I have him. He's waiting.

190
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,118
- Go.
- She has me.

191
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,538
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

192
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,123
Give me a big hug.

193
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,878
- Carol, I have him.
- I'm okay, Mom. She has me. Go.

194
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,718
Close the curtains.

195
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,933
No, no! You can't. He can't take smoke.

196
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,105
Magic.

197
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,785
God! Well, that'll teach you.
I don't even notice it anymore.

198
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,580
Come here.

199
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,095
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- "Little bit of throw-up"?

200
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,726
Well, what shall we do?

201
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,022
Shall I write down which train you take,
or should we lay down...?

202
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,566
No, no, no. I'll take a cab.

203
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,201
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

204
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,669
I promised Simon I'd find him a model.

205
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,047
Carl, take me off the speaker.
These are house seats.

206
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:15,345
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

207
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,766
- Hello?
- Okay. I just found a model.

208
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,648
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

209
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,732
Carl, right?

210
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,487
Hey, what's going on?

211
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,784
- Hey. Hi. Remember?
- L only need one.

212
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,663
You picked me up some time ago.

213
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,541
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

214
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,750
Portrait?

215
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,587
Come here. I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

216
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:55,135
- Brad Pitt is the shit.
- Do you read?

217
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,765
Who is it, baby?

218
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,273
Who is that, Verdell? Who is it?

219
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,445
I'm sorry. I told you today.

220
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,823
I was out in the studio and I just...

221
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,576
All right. So it's out here.

222
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,496
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

223
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,335
I make a big deal about picking models,
but Carl is so thorough.

224
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,754
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

225
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,510
This is not a nude.

226
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,806
Just kidding around.

227
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,143
So much for love.

228
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,688
And yet another pose.

229
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,692
- What is your previous experience?
- How about that?

230
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,112
I'm running out of ideas here.

231
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,659
- Give me some direction, okay?
- Nothing.

232
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:08,041
I just watch until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

233
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:13,296
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

234
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,258
No direction.

235
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,720
Okay.

236
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,183
What I do is, I watch.

237
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,853
Ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

238
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,567
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school? Or...?

239
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,364
Somebody just waiting,
and you see this flash come over them.

240
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:44,369
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external

241
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,787
because that hasn't changed.

242
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,041
When you see it, they're
just sort of realer and more alive.

243
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,463
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

244
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,221
I know exactly what you mean.

245
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,313
Oh, my God. Hold it.

246
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,570
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

247
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:25,034
- Sorry.
- I got on the third line of dialogue.

248
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,163
And all of a sudden I blanked.
No clue as to what the next line is.

249
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,457
Clippity-clop. Clippity-clop. Ignores me.

250
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,752
- So he said to me, "Last chance."
- Last chance.

251
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:38,339
- So I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

252
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,009
I messed up
in the exact same line. I know.

253
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,636
- But guess what.
- What?

254
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,138
He cast mel

255
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,266
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

256
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,894
Okay, okay, okay.

257
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,027
Can't live without me, huh?

258
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:07,243
I'm finally gonna ask. All right,
what's with the plastic picnic ware?

259
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,622
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

260
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:11,831
- You okay?
- Yep.

261
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,125
I see the help. It's a judgment call.

262
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,420
So give yourself a pep talk.

263
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:22,800
"Must try other people's clean silverware
as part of the fun of dining out."

264
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,432
- What's wrong with your son?
- Yeah. What do you care?

265
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,445
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

266
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,197
He's allergic to dust.

267
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,909
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him when there's trouble,

268
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,369
SO an ear infect...

269
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,830
- Is this bothering you?
- No.

270
00:22:55,833 --> 00:23:00,088
An ear infection, whatever, sends us
to the ER five, six times a month,

271
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,674
where I get whatever 9-year-old
they just made a doctor.

272
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,093
Nice chatting.

273
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,515
- His name?
- Spencer.

274
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,601
Okay.

275
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,729
Spence.

276
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,782
It's okay. It's okay.
Go on. Come on, come on.

277
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,875
Put on anything you want now.

278
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,336
I might be sort of done here.

279
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,339
I've been coming for two weeks
and all we've done is work. Let's play!

280
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,635
Vincent!

281
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,690
So you're practically finished?

282
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,486
Yeah. There is one more stage.

283
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:15,538
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just gonna sneak a peek.

284
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,928
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- No! He's not allowed.

285
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:36,476
Wait. I gotta take off. Do you want
to say goodbye or anything?

286
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,854
- Yeah. He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

287
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,649
I'm gonna look at the painting.

288
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,822
Where are you going? Verdell?

289
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:56,162
Want some water?
What is the matter with you? Come on.

290
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,288
You want some water?

291
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,086
Simon, wait!

292
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,131
Yo.

293
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,267
Why are you doing this?

294
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,897
No. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

295
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,776
- See, that painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

296
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:38,913
Excuse me.

297
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,624
- Help me!
- Come on, we gotta go!

298
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,170
Let's go. Come on, come on. Come on.

299
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,893
You call 911 and don't leave your name?

300
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,520
That's right. Yes.

301
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,190
- Even a dumb geezer knows...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

302
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,985
- Oh, is he dead?
- Ask him.

303
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:13,281
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't bark at me. I didn't name you.

304
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:18,453
We will. And if we can't, we'll come back
and ask you. Again and again.

305
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,622
Hey, you trying
to intimidate me with attitude?

306
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:26,169
I come from hell. My grandmother's got
more attitude than you.

307
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,255
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

308
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,884
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

309
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,724
- I've been praying for him since I heard.
- Yeah.

310
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,018
So I'm on my way to the hospital.

311
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,396
- If you could watch the dog for tonight.
- Oh, no, no.

312
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,773
- No?
- No, no.

313
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,567
- No, I'm sorry. No, no, no.
- Okay. Thanks.

314
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,905
Old bitch. Damn dog.

315
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,704
You're taking him! Yes. Yes, you are!

316
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,040
Get the hell out of the way!

317
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,667
You're taking him.
This will even the books.

318
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,712
Wait, wait, wait!

319
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,548
Do you wanna say no to me?

320
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,383
You wanna say no to me?

321
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,513
You wanna say no to me.

322
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,390
I don't wanna say nothing to you.

323
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,979
Because I've never felt this crazy
as I do right now.

324
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,898
I almost want you to say no.

325
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,071
Thanks for looking after him.

326
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,616
Hey! Where you going?

327
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,203
- You can't do this!
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

328
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,749
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before!

329
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,711
Hey, Frank. Frank?

330
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,423
Hey, Frank. Frank!

331
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,074
One, two, three, four.

332
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,537
One, two, three, four.

333
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,221
You're dead.

334
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:47,435
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

335
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,146
You'll eat what we got. What we eat.

336
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,067
All right.

337
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,326
Don't you do anything!

338
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,926
Where's the trust?

339
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,856
Never, never dogs.

340
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,787
Always look at
The bright side of your life

341
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,253
Always look at
The lighter side of your life

342
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,847
God!

343
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:12,645
We're halfway through a show
and we haven't sold a single painting.

344
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,107
No, we can't reduce the price
at this stage. We're...

345
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,193
- I'm in a free fall here. Yes?
- We can see him.

346
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,112
Okay, I'll meet you in there.

347
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,867
I will meet you in there, okay?
One minute.

348
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,079
Thank you. No, I'm here.

349
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:36,711
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

350
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,839
I figured I could tell from your reaction.

351
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:46,470
- That bad?
- Okay, I talked to the doctor and...

352
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,310
Okay, it's not that bad.

353
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,772
The doctors say you'll be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

354
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,276
I mean, the scars might take... Oh, shit!

355
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,489
Oh, Simon.

356
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,243
- Jackie?
- Yes?

357
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,412
Will you hand me a mirror, please?

358
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,497
No.

359
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,882
Wait. I have a smaller one.

360
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,603
So how are things, anyway?

361
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,193
- How is Verdell?
- Your neighbor, Mr. Udall,

362
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,486
taking care of him.

363
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,197
How could you do that?

364
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,033
- He'll hurt him.
- No, no, Simon, I promise.

365
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:54,038
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

366
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,956
I'm always on the move and...

367
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,084
Trust me.

368
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,800
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine, Simon.

369
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,385
Okay.

370
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,808
Waiting gives the devil time.

371
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,077
Oh, my...

372
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,673
Where'd I go?

373
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,720
- That's your dog?
- No. No, no, no.

374
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,098
What are you doing with a dog?

375
00:32:55,975 --> 00:33:00,479
- Suckered in, set up, pushed around.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

376
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,110
No, not until now, for chrissake.

377
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,071
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

378
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,908
Hey, puppy.

379
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,704
I love his little face. It's so cute.

380
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,790
I wonder what breed he is.

381
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:29,008
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

382
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,387
How old are you?

383
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,641
To guess by your eyes, I'd say 50.

384
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:43,397
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

385
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,985
How old are you?
You brought it up. No, I'm curious.

386
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:53,115
- Not that you're ugly.
- Easy, pal. I can take the compliment.

387
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:57,036
But my knees start knocking
when you turn on the charm full blast.

388
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,665
No, but I mean, what's with the dark?

389
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,294
Dawn patrol.

390
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,257
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

391
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:14,762
And this time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

392
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,389
- So I get him home...
- No, no, no!

393
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:23,020
The dog. It's bacon for the dog.

394
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:29,151
Last week, I was playing
the piano for him. And he likes it.

395
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:34,281
So I decide I'm gonna make a little joke.

396
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,200
So you're all set here.

397
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:48,963
It's a beautiful day
for our walk today. Very nice.

398
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,385
What...?

399
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,723
Hey, hey.

400
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,561
Look at that! Look at him.

401
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:09,984
I've gotta give you something. I've gotta
give you something real good too.

402
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:14,029
I'm gonna show it to you. Come on, buddy.

403
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,242
Don't be like me. Don't you be like me.

404
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,287
You stay just the way you are.
You are a perfect man.

405
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,164
I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

406
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,003
I'd like to be treated like that.

407
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:35,092
Get you something. Yes!
Let's go home and do some writing.

408
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:40,514
"He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.

409
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,976
"You've saved my life, ' she said.

410
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,856
"You'd better make it up to me."

411
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,279
Done. Done!

412
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:58,782
Yes, I hate the doggie.
Yes, I hate the doggie.

413
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,745
Sixty-two books. Done!

414
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,875
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

415
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:08,959
No.

416
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:13,922
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

417
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,677
- Here's one for the dog again.
- L can read it. I got it. Okay.

418
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,889
- And all the laundry.
- Okay, good.

419
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:30,189
Boy, look at that. He likes it...
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

420
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:36,779
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

421
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,323
Okay, just sit. Good.

422
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:43,869
We don't want any company. I'll read you
Emerson. Okay, have it your way.

423
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:51,794
Hey.

424
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:54,713
Hey.

425
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,256
How's Verdell doing?

426
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,844
You know, he's a pain in the ass.

427
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,180
Well...

428
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,808
Simon's home.

429
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:11,313
Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

430
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,484
Well, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

431
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:20,114
No, no. He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

432
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,495
Okay. Okay by me.

433
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,212
Hungry? I'll be right with you, pooch.

434
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,972
One, two, three, four, five.

435
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,059
One, two, three, four.

436
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,522
Okay.

437
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,031
Okay.

438
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,802
Three...

439
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,819
Mr. Udall?

440
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,497
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

441
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,500
Would you take it just...

442
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,921
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

443
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,716
Thank you.

444
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,513
Verdell.

445
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:15,562
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here. Come here, boy.

446
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,814
Let's go home and get well.

447
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,316
Okay.

448
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:25,155
You can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

449
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:28,742
Yeah.

450
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,078
Thank you.

451
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,542
Come on, sweetheart.

452
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,755
Verdell, come here. Come here, boy.

453
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,134
I know what you want.

454
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,974
Come on. Where's my boy?

455
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,065
No, no, don't force him.

456
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,684
Over a dog.

457
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,523
Over an ugly dog.

458
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,535
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

459
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,751
Hi.

460
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,127
Help!

461
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,256
If you wanna see me,
you'll make an appointment.

462
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,218
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder

463
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,388
and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

464
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,017
- No debate. You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

465
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,648
- What was that? A tease?
- I can help if you take responsibility...

466
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,026
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

467
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:30,989
I also regrew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

468
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:34,826
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

469
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,121
Now, do you know how hard
it was for me to come here?

470
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,624
- Yes.
- Thank you.

471
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,502
No, we're not doing this now.

472
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:47,130
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

473
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,258
No. Nope.

474
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,431
- Oh, I read that paper.
- Thank you...

475
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,521
What if this is as good as it gets?

476
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,245
What the heck are those for?

477
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:24,626
No, no, no. Get Carol.

478
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,505
I'm filling in.
We don't know if she's coming back.

479
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,091
She might be getting a job closer to home.

480
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,722
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

481
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:42,269
- What the heck do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

482
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:48,066
Just go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

483
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,444
I'll pay whatever you want. I'll wait.

484
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,781
Do it!

485
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,246
- Bryan, Bryan. Code blue. Bryan.
- Oh, no.

486
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,214
Out! Just shut up and get out. Do it!

487
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:18,013
I'll be quiet. Just let me stay here.
No problem.

488
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:22,434
Go get Carol. Get her here.

489
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:29,107
I'm not a prick. You are.
I'm not judging. I'm a great customer.

490
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:32,944
This day has been a disaster.

491
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,742
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

492
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:43,663
Get out immediately
or there's gonna be trouble.

493
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,040
Man, I mean it.

494
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,925
Fine. Okay.

495
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:58,970
Yeah!

496
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,974
See you. Goodbye.

497
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:05,894
It's about time!

498
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:12,567
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

499
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,693
Thank you.

500
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,656
Hey, Dad! Dad, I'm over here.

501
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,454
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

502
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,872
What can you do?

503
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,717
- Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?
- Why not? Sure.

504
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,719
Hello there.

505
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,737
Christ.

506
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,424
I'm hungry.

507
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,095
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

508
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,557
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing.

509
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:30,604
- If you were a waiter...
- Are you totally gone? This is my home.

510
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:38,320
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this,
even though it's an important issue.

511
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:43,450
- I have strong feelings on the subject.
- What subject?

512
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,286
That I wasn't there to take crap from you?

513
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,581
Do you have any control
over how creepy you get?

514
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:58,214
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

515
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:04,679
And to prove it,
I have not gotten personal, and you have.

516
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,851
Why aren't you at work? Are you sick?

517
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,314
You don't look sick.

518
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,860
Just tired and bitter.

519
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,616
My son is sick, okay?

520
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,329
What about your mother?

521
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:36,628
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

522
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,423
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One sec.

523
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:41,549
Mom?

524
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,601
How you doing?

525
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,986
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

526
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:05,281
I'm sorry, Melvin. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners.

527
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:09,869
Back to life.

528
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,422
What's wrong?

529
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,384
Five one-thousand, four one-thousand,

530
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,471
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand... Bingo.

531
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,727
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

532
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,773
Look out, you guys! Coming through!

533
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:45,572
Look out. Look out, you guys.
We're okay. We're okay.

534
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:50,035
Melvin! Wait!

535
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,204
Melvin! Wait!

536
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,004
Shut up, kids!

537
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,924
Give us a lift, would you?

538
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,682
Cover your mouth when you cough, kid.

539
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:18,688
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please.
- Okay.

540
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,775
- Hospital?
- Yes.

541
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:27,072
- Any chance you'll be back at work today?
- No! Stay away from me. God!

542
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:36,706
Simon, we can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to...

543
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:41,795
Simon? Simon, could you just leave
the dog for a second?

544
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,131
Sorry.

545
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:54,891
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

546
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,354
So I would maintain focus
and try not to terrify you.

547
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:05,485
See? He's right. I need the cards.

548
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,450
Simon, you're broke.

549
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:19,958
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

550
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:24,212
I've spoken to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

551
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:29,175
But they'd feel strange calling you.

552
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:33,972
Well, I can't call them. Come here, baby.

553
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,474
Come here, baby.

554
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:40,228
Verdell? What's wrong?

555
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,856
You miss the tough guy?

556
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,984
Well, here I am, sweetheart.

557
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:50,280
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

558
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,950
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I did not meant that.

559
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,953
- Simon. Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

560
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,496
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

561
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:03,668
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't 1?

562
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,759
Oh, my God.

563
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:46,294
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But I think it's more appropriate...

564
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,255
Look, look, I need this.

565
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:52,508
Just say, "Melvin, I'll try." Okay?

566
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,219
Okay?

567
00:50:56,346 --> 00:51:00,308
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

568
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:04,812
Now, on a pleasanter note,
my son, he just got accepted to Brown.

569
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,482
My husband was dying.

570
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:12,904
Yeah. Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

571
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,413
I can't resist.

572
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,832
You usually move through here so quickly.

573
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,418
I just have so many questions
I want to ask you.

574
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:31,839
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

575
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,800
What does it mean to you?

576
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:39,639
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

577
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,977
Oh, God, this is like a nightmare.

578
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,731
Oh, come on. Just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

579
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:55,780
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

580
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,409
And I take away reason and accountability.

581
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,307
"M.D."

582
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,482
What's wrong?

583
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,736
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

584
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,237
- What?
- Hi.

585
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:38,406
- Please, what? Just tell me.
- I'm...

586
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,242
- Just tell me.
- I'm Martin Bettes, Dr. Bettes.

587
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:45,663
- Not your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

588
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:48,416
- What's wrong?
- Hey. Nothing.

589
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,561
Did you know there are doctors
that come to your house?

590
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,003
- No, I didn't.
- I'm home!

591
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,213
- So, what are you doing here?
- Well...

592
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:57,300
- I didn't know you had an admirer.
- What?

593
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,634
Oh, you met the gift.

594
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,388
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

595
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,515
Okay, doctor?

596
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,187
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

597
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:15,818
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

598
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,987
What kind of work do you do?

599
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,365
I'm a waitress.

600
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,201
- In Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

601
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,704
Yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

602
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:31,334
Hi. I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

603
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,960
I couldn't find it either.

604
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:37,298
Could you get this to the lab?
I need CBC, differential, platelets.

605
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,634
- Okay. Okay.
- And I want it back today.

606
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,555
- I'm sorry. Did you say "today"?
- Sure. Let's sit down.

607
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:52,438
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions for the year.

608
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:57,193
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days.

609
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,779
And how he felt and what he's been eating.

610
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,656
That's good. That's very good.

611
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:05,701
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

612
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,496
- Okay. Have they done blood tests?
- Yeah.

613
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:11,457
Only in the ER or when he was well?

614
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,126
- Emergency room only.
- Okay.

615
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,712
- And how about skin testing for allergies?
- No.

616
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:19,924
- No standard scratch test?
- No, I asked.

617
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:24,137
They said my plan didn't cover it
and that it wasn't necessary.

618
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,596
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

619
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,309
- Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!
- Carol!

620
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,898
- I'm sorry.
- I think that's their technical name.

621
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:43,614
So once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

622
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,326
Me. My home number's on the card.

623
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,080
That's his home number.

624
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,881
- What?
- This is your home...

625
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:09,015
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or coffee?

626
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,099
No, thank you.

627
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:12,477
Couple of female slaves?

628
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:19,233
There's still a lot of tests I need to do.
A lot of things I have to find out here.

629
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:23,237
But, look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least,

630
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:26,949
from now on, your son is gonna feel
a great deal better, okay?

631
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,668
Doc!

632
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:46,052
Fine. Okay. Okay. That's good.

633
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,179
That's good.

634
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:50,598
That's...

635
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,646
So let me know about the costs.
One way or another, we'll...

636
00:55:56,729 --> 00:56:00,066
The costs are gonna be considerable,
I'm afraid.

637
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:04,487
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

638
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,743
That's wonderful.

639
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,709
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

640
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:22,922
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

641
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:35,560
- What's wrong?
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?

642
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:36,978
Oh, no.

643
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,273
No.

644
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,332
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

645
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:05,881
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

646
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,384
Absolutely.

647
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,221
You're a wonderful man.

648
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:20,813
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key, in case he's asleep.

649
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:27,028
Open his curtains for him,
so he can see God's beautiful work.

650
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,949
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

651
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,580
Where did you learn to talk like this?
In a "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

652
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,625
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

653
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:44,337
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

654
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:59,602
No, no, no! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

655
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:05,107
Do you really want to go back
to emergency, where they can't help?

656
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:09,028
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

657
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,446
Come on!

658
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,576
You know how this will turn out.

659
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,791
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

660
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,380
Right?

661
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:39,141
No. I do, I understand.
All right, listen, I gotta go, okay?

662
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:41,894
No.

663
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,729
Okay.

664
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,481
Bye-bye.

665
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,234
Bye-bye.

666
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,282
What a day. Come here, come here.

667
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,618
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

668
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,954
Thank you for walking him.

669
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,459
Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.

670
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,921
Hey, this place smells like shit.

671
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,005
Go away.

672
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:16,178
- This cleaning lady doesn't...?
- Please, just leave!

673
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,808
What happened to your queer party friends?

674
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,435
Get out of here!

675
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:31,819
Nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

676
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,406
Nelly, you're a disgrace to depression.

677
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,998
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

678
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,583
Quit worrying.

679
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,085
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

680
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,971
Is this fun for you?

681
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:07,480
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

682
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:12,485
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

683
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:18,199
And I won't.
And I don't wanna paint anymore.

684
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:22,453
So the life that I was trying for is over.

685
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:26,457
The life that I had is gone,
and I'm feeling sorry for myself,

686
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,958
that it's difficult to breathe.

687
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:33,839
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbor is terrified.

688
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,217
Terrified!

689
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,525
I was just trying to give you a boost.

690
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,904
Lucky you. You're here for rock bottom.

691
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:02,076
You absolute horror of a human being.

692
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:19,552
The one thing I'll do for you...
I... Might cheer you up.

693
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:21,804
Get out.

694
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:27,393
You wanna know why
the dog prefers me? It's not affection.

695
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,727
It's a trick.

696
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,941
I keep bacon in my pocket.

697
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,861
See?

698
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,072
Oh, my gosh.

699
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:47,997
We'll both call him.
You'll see. It's a trick.

700
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:51,584
Okay?

701
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,926
Come here, Verdell. Come here.

702
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,433
Come on.

703
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:12,646
- Come here. Come here, baby.
- No.

704
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,356
It's okay. Come here.

705
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,696
Just a stupid dog.

706
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:24,783
Could you leave now?

707
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:27,703
Please?

708
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,250
I don't get it. I don't get it.

709
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,096
Taxi!

710
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,589
With Nick at Nite's "Classic TV Rewind."

711
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:06,635
On repeat viewing, one begins
to suspect that might not really be

712
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,637
Major Healey in the phone booth.

713
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:10,973
Mr. Udall!

714
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,853
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

715
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,487
Hi.

716
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:29,992
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

717
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,250
If you're...

718
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,092
If you're worried about thanking me...

719
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:48,761
That's not why I'm here.

720
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,142
Though it's nice to talk
to a real doctor about Spencer.

721
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:00,606
Note. Put it in a note.

722
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,240
I have...

723
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,871
- I have a hair dryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

724
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,419
So you'd come back to work and wait on me.

725
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:26,006
Do have some idea how strange that sounds?

726
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,094
I'm worried you did this...

727
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,696
Are you waiting for me to say something?

728
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:55,619
Look...

729
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:00,833
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

730
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,045
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

731
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:06,755
Clear what up?

732
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:15,264
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you. Never, ever.

733
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,392
Not ever!

734
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:26,942
Well, I'm sorry, but...

735
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:33,323
we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

736
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:36,743
I'm not kidding.

737
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:39,913
Anything else?

738
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:44,543
I just...

739
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,380
Thank you.

740
01:06:53,886 --> 01:06:55,679
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

741
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:00,934
Yes.

742
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,953
"Never," she said. "Never," she says.

743
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,933
Took a chance you were up.

744
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,895
I brought you some Chinese soup.

745
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,524
Thanks.

746
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,290
Boy.

747
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:09,086
Never been this tired in my life.

748
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,054
I haven't been sleeping.

749
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:26,728
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

750
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,441
I'm in trouble.

751
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,612
It's not just the tiredness.

752
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:40,158
- Boy.
- It's sick. Nauseous.

753
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,410
Sleepy.

754
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:48,125
Where everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

755
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,044
And you can barely find
the will to complain.

756
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,922
Yeah. Yeah.

757
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,093
I'm glad we did this.

758
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:02,097
Good talking to you.

759
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:17,487
- Still writing that thank-you note?
- Last page. How do you spell "conscience"?

760
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:21,742
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

761
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:26,288
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to babysit, so we could go out.

762
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:31,209
I don't feel safe leaving Spencer
with someone. Spell it again?

763
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:36,465
Spencer's okay. Better start finding
something to do with your free time.

764
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,135
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

765
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,219
All right.

766
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,057
We got pizza. Carol and I are going out.

767
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,352
Sausage, pepperoni.
You wanna make this later?

768
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:53,106
We are going out, like people do.

769
01:09:55,692 --> 01:10:01,531
If you can't feel good about this break
and step out a little,

770
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:07,287
then I think you ought to have
Mr. Udall send you over a psychiatrist.

771
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:10,499
I don't need one!
I know what's going on here.

772
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:18,715
I gotta finish this letter or go nuts.
This can't be right. "Con science"?

773
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,218
Carol.

774
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:27,808
What?

775
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:47,160
It's very weird not feeling that...

776
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:51,456
stupid panic thing inside me all the time.

777
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,753
Without that,
I just start thinking about myself.

778
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:59,673
And what good does that ever get anybody?

779
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,596
Today on the bus,
there was this adorable couple.

780
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,807
And I felt myself...

781
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,353
giving them a dirty look.

782
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:18,859
I just had no... idea.

783
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,110
Everything was...

784
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:29,911
Go ahead.

785
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:35,542
Moving in the wrong direction.

786
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:41,465
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man

787
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:45,594
to anything, hold fucking...

788
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,889
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

789
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,808
Hands with, for chrissake.

790
01:11:55,395 --> 01:12:01,610
And I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

791
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:08,909
Which is probably why I make
Spence hug me more than he wants to.

792
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,458
Poor kid has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

793
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,256
Who needs these thoughts?

794
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,260
So, what are you saying,
that you're frustrated?

795
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:32,474
Leave me be. Why are you doing this?
What is it you want?

796
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:38,396
Does getting me thinking about
all that's wrong have some purpose?

797
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:42,817
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

798
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,280
- What?!
- L want us to go out.

799
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:56,706
Okay.

800
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,439
- Thank you.
- Now I'll send you a thank-you note.

801
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,279
Oh, look. Evelyn's here.
And her giant, Joey!

802
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,030
Emily!

803
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:30,115
That's really why you brought me here?

804
01:13:30,116 --> 01:13:31,950
That's really why you brought me here?

805
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:38,498
Well, you know, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

806
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:42,669
But the dog did throw up twice last night.
His spark is off.

807
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:48,174
- Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

808
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:51,636
- They need him for a couple of days.
- Well, do it! What...?

809
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:55,515
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

810
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,269
- This is for later.
- What's this?

811
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,648
- It's a note.
- A note?

812
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,653
- Yeah, it's a thank-you note.
- A thank-you note? No, no.

813
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:11,239
- You can read it later.
- No. No, thank you.

814
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:15,285
No. No thank-you note. No, no, no.

815
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:18,496
Thank you. Thank you.

816
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:26,046
She's nice.

817
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:31,301
- Yeah. Really nice.
- Real nice, huh?

818
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:39,142
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, "No thanks required"?

819
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,021
Sure looks like it went over too.

820
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,984
I mean, look at you.

821
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:54,199
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

822
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,582
- What?
- You think I'm a mark.

823
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,085
You helped with the dog,
now there's other things.

824
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:08,004
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

825
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:11,174
- Concerned? Hey.
- It's not just financial assistance.

826
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,386
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

827
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:20,141
Yeah, well, if his parents are alive,
they have to help. It's the rules.

828
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:23,228
- Good. That's great. Let them help him.
- Absolutely.

829
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:26,898
Only...

830
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:32,112
I got a selling painter coming through,
so I'm out.

831
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:34,823
Can you drive him?

832
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:39,953
Think white and get serious!

833
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,622
Take my car? A convertible.

834
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,713
- Do you drive?
- Like the wind. But I'm not doing it!

835
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,756
Getting loud. Getting loud.

836
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:56,761
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

837
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,514
I want your life for one minute
where my big problem is

838
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,767
somebody offers me a free convertible,
so I can get out of this city.

839
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:14,195
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

840
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:20,618
I'll take him. Get him ready, packed.
Tomorrow morning, I'll take him. Okay.

841
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:23,538
- I'll take him. Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

842
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:28,209
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

843
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:30,545
We don't enjoy one another that much.

844
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,304
If there is some mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you,

845
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,139
please, be sure let me know.

846
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:43,975
- Last-word freak.
- Bye-bye.

847
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,310
Good luck, lady.

848
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:51,149
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

849
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:56,154
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

850
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,824
- Okay.
- Hey.

851
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,704
What I did for you, it's working out?

852
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,377
What you did changed my life.

853
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:14,797
No.

854
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,092
No thank-you note.

855
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:22,347
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life

856
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,848
that you won't read...

857
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:30,897
is that somehow you have done more
for my mother, my son and me

858
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,899
than anybody else ever has.

859
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,778
I'm just gonna read you this part of it.

860
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:44,118
"That makes you the most generous person
I ever met in my life.

861
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:49,123
And you're gonna be in our prayers,
our daily prayers, forever."

862
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:51,834
Lovely.

863
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:58,550
I also wrote one part...
I'm just gonna say I wrote, "I'm sorry."

864
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:05,765
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

865
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:09,143
When you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

866
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,896
So I wrote that I was sorry about that
and that I...

867
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,773
I wrote I was sorry
for busting you on that

868
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,984
and for busting in on you that night

869
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,986
when I said I was never...

870
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:26,828
I was sorry. I'm sorry for every time
your food was cold and you had to wait.

871
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:30,081
And I'm sorry for never spotting
right there in the restaurant

872
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,835
the human being
that did this thing for us.

873
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,964
I'll just start from the beginning.

874
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:42,844
"I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you.

875
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:47,181
The word ‘grateful' doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel."

876
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:56,357
That's nice of you. Thank you.

877
01:18:58,985 --> 01:18:59,986
Thank you.

878
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,749
Now I want you to do something for me.

879
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:25,261
I'm sorry. Didn't I say, "What?"
I thought I said what.

880
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:32,936
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

881
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:37,690
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

882
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:41,361
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff one-eye on me.

883
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:45,657
I need you to chaperone.
Separate everything but cars.

884
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,284
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

885
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:52,080
- I'm sorry. The stiff one-eye?
- Two days.

886
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:54,332
- L can't, I work.
- You get off when you want to.

887
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:57,251
- My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

888
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,589
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What has that got to do with it?

889
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:05,927
- Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

890
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:11,224
- I need a hand and where'd she go?
- Accepting your help obligates me?

891
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,186
Is there any other way to see it?

892
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,066
No.

893
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:30,326
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

894
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,213
There's no way to pack for this trip.

895
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,904
Hello.

896
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,782
- You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

897
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:14,245
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

898
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:20,626
Just south of Baltimore, Maryland.
I know what you're gonna say.

899
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:23,963
I mean, I... I think I know.

900
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:31,429
- I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

901
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:37,560
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

902
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:40,396
Well, I...

903
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,108
I mean, maybe.

904
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:50,031
- Yes, yes. Let's. Let's.
- Okay. Got you.

905
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:57,205
- What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

906
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:01,292
Okay, then. Good night.

907
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:09,092
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

908
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:11,135
No.

909
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,822
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

910
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,973
Put him in with that one. Not that one.

911
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:17,725
- Builds his confidence, huh?
- Okay.

912
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:20,186
Lip kiss.

913
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,400
I love you. I'll miss you.

914
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:28,903
Hey! Real sensitive.

915
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:34,283
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

916
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:45,419
- Don't worry, Mom. Have a good time.
- Don't run!

917
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:49,298
- Have fun, don't worry.
- Don't run. Have fun, but don't run.

918
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,384
Grandma will take care of me. Bye!

919
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,641
- Sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

920
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:00,643
Give me a hug.

921
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:06,149
- Everything's gonna be okay. All right?
- Yeah.

922
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:12,029
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

923
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,493
Hello.

924
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:23,915
Hi.

925
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:26,586
Hi.

926
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,338
Thank you for being on time.

927
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:32,967
Hi.

928
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:37,471
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

929
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:41,100
Hello.

930
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:43,895
Holy God. Who did that to you?

931
01:23:46,731 --> 01:23:51,152
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

932
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,488
And I was hospitalized.

933
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:59,452
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

934
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:01,162
Let's go.

935
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:08,127
- I was gonna do that for you.
- Where should we sit?

936
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:13,549
- L1... Well, there's no place cards.
- Look like you need room.

937
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:15,509
So I'll sit in the back.

938
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:34,237
Never a break. Never.

939
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,240
Thank you. That was very thoughtful.

940
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,452
- You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

941
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:46,498
Thanks.

942
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,424
Thank you.

943
01:24:58,761 --> 01:24:59,762
You're welcome.

944
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:07,061
I've got the whole trip programmed.

945
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:15,486
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

946
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:17,612
No.

947
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:19,365
Seriously.

948
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:21,742
We got good stuff here.

949
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,219
I like this music.

950
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:44,890
I like this music.

951
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,285
Yes, I'm sure, Simon, they did something
really off for you to feel this way.

952
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:07,580
But when it comes
to your parents or your kid,

953
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:11,751
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

954
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:17,131
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

955
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,092
Nonsense. And you want to know why?

956
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:23,804
Anybody here who's interested in
what Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

957
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,573
You wanna know
what happened with my parents?

958
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:36,567
Yes.

959
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:42,156
- When I was a kid...
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna pull over.

960
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:51,999
Well, I always painted.
And my mother always encouraged me.

961
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:55,753
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

962
01:26:56,462 --> 01:27:02,385
She used to... I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

963
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:04,595
And she was very natural.

964
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,391
So she used to pose nude for me.

965
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:14,730
And I always thought
that my father knew about it.

966
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:17,858
- This stuff is pointless.
- Hey! Let him finish.

967
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:20,319
You like sad stories? You wanna hear mine?

968
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:21,570
Stop!

969
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,285
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

970
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:35,543
One day, he walked in and he found us.
And he just started screaming.

971
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:38,879
My father didn't come out
of his room for 11 years.

972
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:43,426
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

973
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,393
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

974
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,354
Please, come on.

975
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:58,774
He was...

976
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:05,823
- Come on.
- Yeah, I was defending my mother.

977
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:12,413
And I was trying to, you know,
make peace in the lamest way.

978
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:17,501
I said, "She's not naked. It's art."

979
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:22,214
And he started hitting me.

980
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:27,595
And he beat me unconscious.

981
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:34,185
And he talked to me less and less.
I mean, he knew what I was before I did.

982
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:39,815
And the morning that I left for college,
he walked into my room.

983
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:45,613
And he held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

984
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:51,327
A big, sweaty wad of money.

985
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:56,916
And he said,
"I don't want you to ever come back."

986
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:02,379
And I just grabbed him and I hugged him.

987
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:05,424
And he turned and walked out.

988
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:20,940
Hey, we all have these terrible stories
to get over and you...

989
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,107
It's not true.

990
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:25,736
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories.

991
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:31,825
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

992
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:36,997
Just no one in this car.
But a lot of people, that's their story.

993
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:39,333
Good times, noodle salad.

994
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:42,836
What makes it so hard is not
that you had it bad,

995
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,216
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

996
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:51,595
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

997
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,557
Not it at all?

998
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:01,272
Okay. Let's go to the hotel.

999
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:07,403
And you'll see if you can get another wad
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1000
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,831
Can I ask you a personal question?

1001
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,168
Sure.

1002
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,881
You ever get an erection over a woman?

1003
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:34,346
- Melvin...
- Wouldn't your life be easier if you...?

1004
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,515
You consider your life easy?

1005
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:41,478
All right. I give you that one.

1006
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:46,609
Nice packing.

1007
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,578
- Hi.
- Hey, Spence.

1008
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,289
Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

1009
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,585
- Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, I scored a goal.

1010
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:09,673
- You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie. You know.

1011
01:31:09,757 --> 01:31:14,261
- That's great. Oh, my God! Right?
- Yeah, amazing.

1012
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:18,849
- Mom, we're playing again. Gotta go.
- Wait. Just tell me...

1013
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:25,105
- He scored a goal.
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1014
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,150
Oh, you would have died.

1015
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:33,197
My son was outside playing soccer.

1016
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:39,328
- Come on, take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

1017
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:43,916
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

1018
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,001
- No.
- Please, come on. Oh, come on.

1019
01:31:46,085 --> 01:31:47,085
No.

1020
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:51,674
- All right. All right. You're right.
- Yeah.

1021
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:56,804
- Are you sad or something?
- No, no, no. I'm nervous.

1022
01:31:57,429 --> 01:32:01,141
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1023
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,976
What a nice compliment.

1024
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,449
I'm happy.

1025
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:20,619
And you're my date.

1026
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:24,456
Let's get dressed.

1027
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:37,219
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

1028
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:38,303
Okay!

1029
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,219
- All set?
- Yeah.

1030
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:25,517
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1031
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:28,687
- Do they sell hard-shells? Do they?
- Yes.

1032
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:39,281
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1033
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:42,826
Thank you.

1034
01:33:45,037 --> 01:33:46,747
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1035
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,957
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1036
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:50,125
Just him, that's all.

1037
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:53,879
- Okay, you can answer.
- Yes, we do.

1038
01:33:55,047 --> 01:33:57,758
- L can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

1039
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:01,470
They require a tie and jacket.
But we have some available.

1040
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:13,856
Sir?

1041
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,402
No. I'm not putting that on.

1042
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:22,533
And I won't let you inject me
with the plague either.

1043
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:28,080
It's a nice place. You dry-clean these
all the time, don't you?

1044
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,373
I don't think so.

1045
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:42,135
Well, you just... wait here.

1046
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:44,346
Excuse me. Thank you.

1047
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:57,150
Good evening.

1048
01:34:59,987 --> 01:35:03,198
- L need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

1049
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,616
No.

1050
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:08,745
- No?
- That one.

1051
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:12,374
- This one?
- That one. And this tie.

1052
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:23,510
Excuse me.

1053
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:31,894
She's here. We saved a table for you.

1054
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,353
Oh, thanks.

1055
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:38,859
- Should I get her for you?
- Nah, that's all right. I'll just watch.

1056
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:48,744
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, this is plenty. No, thank you.

1057
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:24,655
Ma'am.

1058
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:34,206
Oh, wait.

1059
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:45,175
The maitre d' is following me.

1060
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:06,321
You look so se...

1061
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,202
You look great.

1062
01:37:14,538 --> 01:37:15,539
You look great.

1063
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:27,968
You wanna dance?

1064
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,889
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1065
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:35,058
- And?
- No.

1066
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,896
I don't get this place.

1067
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:45,569
They make me buy a new outfit
and they let you in in a housedress.

1068
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:46,653
I don't get it.

1069
01:37:48,572 --> 01:37:52,159
What? No. Wait. Why? Where are you going?

1070
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:54,244
Why?

1071
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:01,168
I didn't mean it that way.
I mean... You got to sit down.

1072
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:04,254
Give me the dirty look.
Just sit down and give it to me.

1073
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:06,548
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1074
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,009
I need one. Quick.

1075
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:13,221
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1076
01:38:14,014 --> 01:38:18,852
The minute someone gets that
they need you, they threaten to walk out.

1077
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:22,773
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1078
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,193
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1079
01:38:36,787 --> 01:38:38,038
And mean it.

1080
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:51,343
Can we order first?

1081
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:55,806
Okay.

1082
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:03,563
Two hard-shell crab dinners.
Pitcher of ice-cold beer.

1083
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:07,025
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

1084
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:12,531
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

1085
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:14,866
I'll tell your waiter!

1086
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,661
Not our waiter.

1087
01:39:18,495 --> 01:39:23,959
Okay, now,
I got a great compliment for you.

1088
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,335
And it's true.

1089
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:28,380
I'm so afraid it's something awful.

1090
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,008
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style.

1091
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:35,762
Okay. Here I go.

1092
01:39:37,097 --> 01:39:38,723
Clearly a mistake.

1093
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:45,480
I've got this... What? Ailment.

1094
01:39:49,526 --> 01:39:52,904
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to all the time,

1095
01:39:52,988 --> 01:39:58,827
he says that in 50 or 60% of the cases,
a pill really helps.

1096
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:03,248
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing, pills.

1097
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:08,253
Hate. I'm using
the word "hate" here about pills. Hate.

1098
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:13,466
My compliment is, that night you came
over and told me you would never...

1099
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:20,473
All right, well, you were there,
you know what you said.

1100
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:23,143
Well, my compliment to you is...

1101
01:40:24,436 --> 01:40:29,024
the next morning,
I started taking the pills.

1102
01:40:32,694 --> 01:40:35,363
I don't get how
that's a compliment for me.

1103
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,622
You make me want to be a better man.

1104
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:59,137
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

1105
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:09,814
Well, maybe I overshot a little
to keep you from walking out.

1106
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:24,204
How's it going with those pills?

1107
01:41:25,664 --> 01:41:28,458
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

1108
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:32,003
Well, it's...

1109
01:41:34,047 --> 01:41:36,132
It's little by little.

1110
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:42,722
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

1111
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:06,371
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

1112
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:08,290
Never.

1113
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,126
Here's the trouble with never.

1114
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:37,736
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1115
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:44,868
When I first saw you,
I thought you were handsome.

1116
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,913
Then, of course, you spoke.

1117
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:53,752
So now that your...

1118
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,797
soft, little underbelly is all exposed...

1119
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,967
tell me, why did you bring me here?

1120
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:08,141
Well, I... It's a...

1121
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:17,233
- That's a personal question. I...
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

1122
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:21,237
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

1123
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:27,077
It's okay. If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1124
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:30,038
Well, I...

1125
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:37,170
There's a lot of reasons.

1126
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:40,965
I thought, one thought, maybe,
if you had sex with Simon,

1127
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:42,717
- maybe...
- What?

1128
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:49,474
- That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

1129
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:54,562
Like I'm a, what? And I owe you what?

1130
01:43:54,646 --> 01:44:00,068
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought that I had.

1131
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,237
It came out first.
That's all there was to it.

1132
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:07,659
I thought, you kiss him, me,
when you two seemed to hit it off.

1133
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:12,997
No, wait. I didn't mean...
Forget what I said about Simon.

1134
01:44:13,081 --> 01:44:15,250
- I'll never forget it.
- It's a mistake.

1135
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,211
It was a mistake.

1136
01:44:24,968 --> 01:44:27,387
- Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
- And Terry.

1137
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,681
We're unable to take your call now.

1138
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:34,811
- Please leave a message. Goodbye.
- Say goodbye. And thank you.

1139
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:37,772
It's Simon.

1140
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,567
I'm in town.

1141
01:44:42,819 --> 01:44:43,820
Hello?

1142
01:44:46,656 --> 01:44:51,286
Folks, you've never been out later than
10:00 in your lives. Pick up the phone.

1143
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:55,540
Really.

1144
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:04,674
I'm gonna try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

1145
01:45:05,425 --> 01:45:07,135
Or at least get you to answer the phone.

1146
01:45:17,687 --> 01:45:18,688
How are you?

1147
01:45:20,148 --> 01:45:23,276
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

1148
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:26,779
- And he won't come knocking on your door.
- What happened?

1149
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:28,990
Don't ask.

1150
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,205
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1151
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:36,623
- Do you need help with...?
- No.

1152
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,462
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1153
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,340
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1154
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,303
Don't ask. I'm tired of my complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1155
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:54,933
- Why? What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

1156
01:45:57,101 --> 01:46:00,230
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1157
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:16,079
- Good night.
- Good night.

1158
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:00,164
Hold it.

1159
01:47:21,561 --> 01:47:22,562
I have to draw you.

1160
01:47:26,733 --> 01:47:30,987
- I have to draw you.
- No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1161
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:34,699
- I'm a lot more shy than people think.
- I have to.

1162
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:39,454
- I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

1163
01:47:40,705 --> 01:47:44,667
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

1164
01:47:46,127 --> 01:47:47,837
The back. The line of you.

1165
01:47:51,049 --> 01:47:53,259
You're why cavemen chiseled on walls.

1166
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,015
Cut me a break.

1167
01:48:22,622 --> 01:48:26,668
The next thing I know,
she's sitting right there next to me.

1168
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:32,006
Well, it's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

1169
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:35,968
I screwed up, I said the wrong thing.

1170
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:41,391
Where, if I hadn't,

1171
01:48:43,184 --> 01:48:45,978
I could be in bed right now
with a woman who...

1172
01:48:47,063 --> 01:48:49,440
if you make her laugh, you got a life.

1173
01:48:52,402 --> 01:48:54,028
Instead, I'm here with you.

1174
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:59,867
No offense, but a moron pushing
the last legal drug.

1175
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:05,707
Jameson, soda back.

1176
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:13,005
Sorry. I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

1177
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:18,136
No, no, this is...
This is great. This is so great.

1178
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:22,515
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up. Hold it.

1179
01:49:22,598 --> 01:49:25,768
- I'm just turning.
- Hold that. Hold any of them.

1180
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:27,770
- Okay, this?
- It doesn't matter.

1181
01:49:27,854 --> 01:49:30,356
My hand's not even bothering me.

1182
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,400
I can't... I just...

1183
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,779
I can't get the angle with this cast.

1184
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:41,951
Careful.

1185
01:49:54,297 --> 01:49:56,674
I'm coming in. It's late.

1186
01:50:03,556 --> 01:50:08,728
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

1187
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:13,940
Sorry.

1188
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:20,656
I didn't know she was still here.
Did you have sex with her?

1189
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:24,494
To hell with sex! It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1190
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:31,334
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1191
01:50:37,507 --> 01:50:38,508
Just love her.

1192
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:46,473
How you doing?

1193
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:05,910
- Hello?
- Mom? Hi.

1194
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:07,411
Hello, Simon.

1195
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:11,123
- You were right. We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?

1196
01:51:11,207 --> 01:51:16,754
- I'm not a screamer.
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

1197
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:19,215
- Your father is not feeling well.
- I can't hear you.

1198
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:21,551
It was too late to start
with the whole thing. Hold on.

1199
01:51:21,634 --> 01:51:24,554
For what? What do you gotta do?
Where you going?

1200
01:51:24,637 --> 01:51:29,058
- I get why you're angry with me, but...
- He's talking to his parents.

1201
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:33,855
Then you listen to me.
Truly, no grudges. Okay? Truly.

1202
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:38,734
It was odd that you didn't come and see me
when you heard that I was hurt.

1203
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:41,737
- We almost did.
- I don't want to talk about it.

1204
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:44,866
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1205
01:51:44,949 --> 01:51:46,409
You do sound different.

1206
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:49,787
- Yes, I'm working again.
- Good. About money...

1207
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:54,458
No, I don't need anything.
I'll drop you a line from wherever I land.

1208
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,128
It's up to you to make the next move.
And I hope that you do.

1209
01:51:57,211 --> 01:52:02,258
He's gonna wanna stay. And they'll
take a ride to the lake or whatever.

1210
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:03,509
You know...

1211
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:06,596
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

1212
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:07,763
Bye, Mom.

1213
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:13,352
We'll probably have a five-hour drive.
It'll give us a chance

1214
01:52:13,436 --> 01:52:14,979
- to relax...
- So?

1215
01:52:15,897 --> 01:52:19,191
- I'm coming with you.
- What about your parents?

1216
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:22,486
- No, no, no. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

1217
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:28,701
- You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1218
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:31,203
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

1219
01:52:32,747 --> 01:52:35,958
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1220
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:41,589
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1221
01:52:46,302 --> 01:52:48,471
- No choice.
- I got a gift for you!

1222
01:52:48,554 --> 01:52:50,681
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1223
01:52:51,766 --> 01:52:52,767
Let me see.

1224
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:56,354
- Gorgeous.
- Do it.

1225
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:59,774
And get the dog picked up.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1226
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:01,943
Goodbye.

1227
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,321
Your luck's running.

1228
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:10,326
They sub-let your place. You're homeless.

1229
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:16,874
- Frank's got a line on another place.
- Another place where?

1230
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:19,293
Does it matter?

1231
01:53:23,005 --> 01:53:25,424
No, it doesn't.

1232
01:53:26,968 --> 01:53:29,387
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1233
01:53:30,763 --> 01:53:33,015
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

1234
01:54:05,423 --> 01:54:09,385
- I don't wanna hear that music now.
- You said you liked it.

1235
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:10,469
I don't.

1236
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:17,727
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your car, but I don't wanna hear it.

1237
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,770
If that means anything.

1238
01:54:39,415 --> 01:54:41,083
Yes, sir. All right.

1239
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:45,421
Here's the keys to my apartment.

1240
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:50,676
You go up there and wait,
and I'll take Carol home. Wait...

1241
01:54:51,594 --> 01:54:54,138
- I'll take a bus.
- No, no, I'll take you.

1242
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,772
Can you come here?

1243
01:55:03,564 --> 01:55:06,400
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1244
01:55:07,735 --> 01:55:10,154
I don't think I want to know you anymore.

1245
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,364
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1246
01:55:16,452 --> 01:55:17,661
You have my number.

1247
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:24,001
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1248
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,130
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1249
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:40,518
Don't say anything.

1250
01:55:44,146 --> 01:55:47,358
I gotta get ahold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

1251
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:49,151
Well...

1252
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:52,822
I think you're gonna have to camp it here.

1253
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:56,659
- What are you talking about?
- Look, there's Verdell!

1254
01:55:58,285 --> 01:55:59,829
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1255
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:08,045
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1256
01:56:11,006 --> 01:56:13,926
Sorry. You're just fun to mess with.

1257
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:21,016
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

1258
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:26,897
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room. I never use it.

1259
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:31,110
- It's got good light. No other choice.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

1260
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:41,036
Nice. It's... Looks good.

1261
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:44,206
They got your music,

1262
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,459
paintings, paints.

1263
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:49,920
Have to say, they did a good job.

1264
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:51,463
It's...

1265
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:55,426
No. It's gonna be okay, huh?

1266
01:56:56,218 --> 01:56:58,637
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1267
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:06,020
Thank you, Melvin.

1268
01:57:08,314 --> 01:57:09,732
You overwhelm me.

1269
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:18,240
I love you.

1270
01:57:24,997 --> 01:57:26,290
I tell you, buddy,

1271
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:30,753
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1272
01:57:38,385 --> 01:57:39,637
Well, it's...

1273
01:57:43,641 --> 01:57:45,184
Make yourself at home.

1274
01:57:48,145 --> 01:57:49,647
Anything else in the bag?

1275
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:53,817
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1276
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:55,194
I know.

1277
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:57,571
I love my cookbook.

1278
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:04,036
It's great. It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

1279
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:08,582
Never fixed shark before. Shark
with a bite. Would you like that, Spencer?

1280
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:12,378
- No.
- Some cookies here called Wasps' Nests.

1281
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:18,509
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1282
01:58:19,343 --> 01:58:23,597
Where is he? Where is my beautiful boy?

1283
01:58:24,265 --> 01:58:25,266
Sweetheart!

1284
01:58:28,227 --> 01:58:30,729
- You're in bed.
- No, no. No.

1285
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:32,856
Yeah...

1286
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:40,781
I just didn't think Verdell should get
too comfortable sleeping here.

1287
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:44,326
Well, look, the dog's already comfortable.

1288
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,581
Is this okay?

1289
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:56,213
Hello. Hi, it's me. Hi.

1290
01:58:56,297 --> 01:59:01,844
Yes! He took me in.
Yes. It's Carol for you.

1291
01:59:01,927 --> 01:59:06,223
- Yeah, Jackie brought my stuff and...
- Just take the dog.

1292
01:59:06,307 --> 01:59:07,850
- Take the dog.
- Gotta go.

1293
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:10,144
- Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1294
01:59:10,227 --> 01:59:12,271
That's right. Take him. All right.

1295
01:59:13,147 --> 01:59:17,735
- Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

1296
01:59:30,873 --> 01:59:31,873
Hello?

1297
01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:34,877
Yeah.

1298
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,546
- How you doing?
- Not so hot.

1299
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:39,631
Why? What's wrong?

1300
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:44,178
Was I sensible or hard on you?

1301
01:59:44,261 --> 01:59:50,684
- Maybe both. Maybe.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

1302
01:59:50,768 --> 01:59:53,979
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer everything!

1303
01:59:54,063 --> 01:59:57,232
Just listen to me, okay? Listen to me.

1304
01:59:58,859 --> 02:00:02,029
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1305
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,990
And what I said on the street...

1306
02:00:06,408 --> 02:00:08,369
That was a bad thing to say.

1307
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:12,915
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1308
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:20,464
And I'd be lying
if I didn't say I enjoy your company.

1309
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:25,302
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1310
02:00:25,386 --> 02:00:29,431
And I know that it...
Think that it's better for me

1311
02:00:29,515 --> 02:00:32,434
to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1312
02:00:32,518 --> 02:00:36,772
You're a pretty old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

1313
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:42,778
But there were extraordinary kindnesses
that did take place.

1314
02:00:50,953 --> 02:00:52,413
So anyway, thanks for the trip.

1315
02:00:55,124 --> 02:00:59,253
- Good night. Good night.
- Okay if I say something now?

1316
02:01:04,508 --> 02:01:05,509
Go ahead.

1317
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:10,222
I should have danced with you.

1318
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:16,353
Good night.

1319
02:01:18,856 --> 02:01:19,857
Good night.

1320
02:01:38,459 --> 02:01:42,171
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?!
- I'm coming.

1321
02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:56,768
- What'd she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1322
02:01:56,852 --> 02:01:58,562
Extraordinary.

1323
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:01,482
And she doesn't want contact with me.

1324
02:02:04,026 --> 02:02:05,486
I'm dying here.

1325
02:02:08,197 --> 02:02:11,450
Because... you love her.

1326
02:02:12,618 --> 02:02:13,619
No.

1327
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:17,623
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1328
02:02:17,706 --> 02:02:21,418
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1329
02:02:22,294 --> 02:02:26,048
- I don't know. Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1330
02:02:26,131 --> 02:02:28,967
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1331
02:02:29,051 --> 02:02:30,177
It's...

1332
02:02:31,386 --> 02:02:37,309
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1333
02:02:40,062 --> 02:02:44,107
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1334
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:46,902
Well, it's better than this.

1335
02:02:46,985 --> 02:02:49,780
Look, you, I'm very intelligent.

1336
02:02:49,863 --> 02:02:52,824
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1337
02:02:52,908 --> 02:02:56,912
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut the hell up.

1338
02:02:56,995 --> 02:03:01,083
I mean, I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

1339
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:02,668
Picking on me won't help.

1340
02:03:05,337 --> 02:03:07,589
If that's true, I'm really in trouble.

1341
02:03:09,383 --> 02:03:13,554
But, Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1342
02:03:18,267 --> 02:03:19,726
You know who you want.

1343
02:03:22,062 --> 02:03:28,235
I would take your seat any day.
So do something. Go over there.

1344
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:33,657
Now. Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1345
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,367
You can do this, Melvin.

1346
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:37,911
You can do this. You can.

1347
02:03:37,995 --> 02:03:41,248
Pull the stops,
tell her how you feel, you can do this.

1348
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:45,669
- Hey, I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1349
02:03:45,752 --> 02:03:47,296
She might kill me if I go there.

1350
02:03:47,379 --> 02:03:50,465
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1351
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:52,384
I think you have a chance here.

1352
02:03:52,467 --> 02:03:56,388
The best thing going for you is
your willingness to humiliate yourself.

1353
02:03:56,471 --> 02:03:59,600
So go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1354
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:07,107
- Okay.
- Okay.

1355
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:11,320
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1356
02:04:14,448 --> 02:04:15,449
Here I go.

1357
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,084
What's wrong?

1358
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:32,215
I forgot to lock the door.

1359
02:05:52,087 --> 02:05:55,757
- What do you want, Melvin?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1360
02:05:55,841 --> 02:05:57,467
I wasn't asleep.

1361
02:06:02,514 --> 02:06:03,598
What a break.

1362
02:06:06,435 --> 02:06:08,228
Is it a secret what you're doing here?

1363
02:06:12,858 --> 02:06:14,109
I had to see you.

1364
02:06:18,447 --> 02:06:19,448
Because?

1365
02:06:23,285 --> 02:06:24,703
It relaxes me.

1366
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:31,960
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb

1367
02:06:32,043 --> 02:06:36,506
than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1368
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:39,301
No, no, no, wait. That's overstating.

1369
02:06:39,384 --> 02:06:45,348
I'd rather be sitting inside,
‘cause I don't get my feet in the gutter.

1370
02:06:45,432 --> 02:06:50,771
Stop it! Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1371
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:54,983
Just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1372
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:58,528
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1373
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:06,328
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

1374
02:07:13,376 --> 02:07:14,878
Boyfriend.

1375
02:07:19,174 --> 02:07:22,886
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1376
02:07:25,013 --> 02:07:27,724
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1377
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:33,522
Maybe we could.

1378
02:08:00,757 --> 02:08:05,595
It feels a little confined in here.
Let's take a walk.

1379
02:08:09,099 --> 02:08:13,812
It's 4 in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1380
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:19,067
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse,

1381
02:08:21,653 --> 02:08:25,782
there's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

1382
02:08:25,866 --> 02:08:31,663
That way we're not screwy,
just two people that like warm rolls.

1383
02:08:35,959 --> 02:08:36,960
Okay.

1384
02:08:55,979 --> 02:08:56,980
What are you doing?

1385
02:08:58,189 --> 02:09:01,276
I still want you
to hear part of that car song.

1386
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:02,360
You don't have to...

1387
02:09:09,784 --> 02:09:14,122
And, darling, I'm never lonely

1388
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:18,084
Whenever you're in sight

1389
02:09:19,127 --> 02:09:20,253
Thank you.

1390
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:23,381
You know, I was h...

1391
02:09:39,731 --> 02:09:43,860
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1392
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:55,914
- I've been...
- What?

1393
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:59,793
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1394
02:10:00,961 --> 02:10:07,092
Even though it may seem that way now,
you don't know me all that well.

1395
02:10:08,802 --> 02:10:10,887
- I'm not the answer for you.
- Hey.

1396
02:10:12,222 --> 02:10:16,101
- I've got a great compliment for you.
- You know what?

1397
02:10:16,184 --> 02:10:19,980
Just let me talk.

1398
02:10:21,398 --> 02:10:22,399
Just...

1399
02:10:26,736 --> 02:10:30,532
I might be the only person
on the face of the earth

1400
02:10:30,615 --> 02:10:33,743
that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

1401
02:10:33,827 --> 02:10:38,456
I might be the only one
who appreciates how amazing you are

1402
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,001
in every single thing that you do.

1403
02:10:41,793 --> 02:10:46,006
And how you are with Spencer. Spence.

1404
02:10:47,215 --> 02:10:50,844
And in every single thought you have.
And how you say what you mean.

1405
02:10:50,927 --> 02:10:53,430
And how you almost always
mean something

1406
02:10:53,513 --> 02:10:58,309
that's all about being straight and good.

1407
02:10:59,394 --> 02:11:03,356
And I think
most people miss that about you.

1408
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:08,820
I wonder how they can watch you bring
their food and clear their tables,

1409
02:11:08,903 --> 02:11:12,323
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1410
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:17,620
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good...

1411
02:11:19,622 --> 02:11:20,623
about me.

1412
02:11:30,258 --> 02:11:34,763
Is that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

1413
02:11:34,846 --> 02:11:36,056
For you?

1414
02:11:45,899 --> 02:11:47,025
No.

1415
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:52,030
Gonna grab you.

1416
02:11:54,074 --> 02:11:57,952
I didn't mean for that to be a question.
I'm gonna grab you.

1417
02:12:22,477 --> 02:12:24,979
I know I can do better than that.

1418
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:50,547
Better. Definitely better.

1419
02:12:56,803 --> 02:12:57,804
See?

1420
02:13:14,696 --> 02:13:17,323
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1421
02:13:27,792 --> 02:13:29,127
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.
