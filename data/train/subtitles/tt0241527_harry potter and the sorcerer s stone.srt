1
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,863
I should have known
that you would be here,

2
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,521
Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,896
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,135
Are the rumors true,

5
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,365
Albus?

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,722
I am afraid so, professor.

7
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:50,265
The good...

8
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,935
and the bad.

9
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,435
And the boy?

10
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:55,311
Hagrid is bringing him.

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,105
Do you think it wise,

12
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:00,003
to trust Hagrid with something
as important as this?

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,443
Oh, professor,

14
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,932
I would trust Hagrid, with my life.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,531
Professor Dumbledore, sir.

16
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,363
Professor McGonagall.

17
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,221
No problems, I trust Hagrid?

18
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:31,707
No, sir.

19
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:35,753
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,090
Try not to wake him.

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,887
There you go.

22
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,965
Albus,

23
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,493
do you really think it's safe,

24
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,272
leaving him with these people?

25
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,621
I have watched them all day.

26
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:57,687
They are the worst sort of Muggles,
imaginable.

27
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,739
They really are...
The only family he has.

28
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,672
This boy will be famous.

29
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:08,307
There won't be a child in our world
who doesn't know his name.

30
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:09,270
Exactly.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,221
He is far better off,

32
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:13,010
growing up away from all of that.

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,346
Until he is ready.

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,951
There, there Hagrid.

35
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,984
It's not really goodbye, after all.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,906
Good luck...

37
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,758
Harry Potter.

38
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,218
Up. Get up!

39
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,710
Now!

40
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,386
Wake up cousin!

41
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:34,984
We are going to the zoo!

42
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,359
Here he comes,

43
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:51,960
the birthday boy.
Happy birthday son.

44
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:56,943
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,161
Yes, Aunt Petunia.

46
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,717
I want everything to be perfect...

47
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,299
for my Dudley's special day!

48
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,419
Hurry up!

49
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,087
Bring my coffee boy.

50
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,261
Yes Uncle Vernon.

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,468
Aren't they wonderful darling?

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,139
How many are there?

53
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,307
36.

54
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,437
Counted them myself.

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,899
36? But last year...
last year I had 37!

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,481
Yeah but some of them
are quite a bit bigger than last year's.

57
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,187
I don't care how big they are!

58
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,157
Oh, now, now, now.
This is what we are going to do...

59
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:31,319
is that when we go out,

60
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,238
we are going to buy you
two new presents.

61
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,032
How is that pumpkin?

62
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,577
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.

63
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,779
I am really looking forward to it.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,740
I am warning you now boy.

65
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,129
Any funny business,

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,578
any at all,

67
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,773
and you won't have any meals,

68
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:54,906
for a week.

69
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:56,412
Get in.

70
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,703
Make it move.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,656
Move!

72
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,288
Move!
He is asleep!

73
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,569
He is boring.

74
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,413
Sorry about him.

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,453
He doesn't understand what it's like,

76
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,719
lying there day after day...

77
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:27,922
watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

78
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:33,196
Can you hear me?

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,969
It's just,

80
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,392
I have never talked to a snake before.

81
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,360
Do you...

82
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:43,808
I mean,

83
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,008
do you talk to people often?

84
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:49,355
You are from Burma, are not you?

85
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:51,415
Was it nice there?

86
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,055
Do you miss your family?

87
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,780
I see.

88
00:06:58,422 --> 00:06:59,699
That's me as well.

89
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,770
I never knew my parents either.

90
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,536
Mummy, Dad, come here!

91
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,871
You won't believe
what this snake is doing!

92
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,243
Thanks.

93
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:33,189
Anytime.

94
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,009
Snake!

95
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,713
Mum! Mummy!

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,599
Help me!

97
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,524
Please, please.
My darling boy!

98
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,323
Help me! Help me!
How did you get in there?

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,520
Who did this? How did you get in there?

100
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,204
Is there a snake?

101
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,605
It's alright, sweetheart.

102
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,046
We will get you out of these cold clothes.

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,696
What happened?

104
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,222
I swear, I don't know!

105
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:24,033
One minute the glass was there
and then it was gone,

106
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,238
it was like magic.

107
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,743
There is no such thing as magic.

108
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,560
And smile!

109
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,271
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

110
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:56,199
In just a week, he will be off to Smeltings.

111
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,067
Caveat Smeltonia.

112
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,199
Proudest moment of my life.

113
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,193
Will I have to wear that too?

114
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,491
What? You?

115
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:07,001
Go to Smeltings?

116
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:13,791
Don't be so stupid!

117
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,815
You are going to go to the state
school where you belong.

118
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:19,299
This is what you will going to be wearing
when I finish dyeing it.

119
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,758
That's Dudley's old uniform.

120
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,075
It will fit me like bits
of old elephant skin.

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,893
It will fit you well enough.

122
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,055
Go get the post.

123
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,425
Go!

124
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,289
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

125
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:04,967
Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!

126
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:06,476
Hey, give it back! It's mine!

127
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,570
Yours? Who would be writing to you?

128
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,363
No more mail through this letterbox.

129
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,425
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,181
Shoo! Go on.

131
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,882
Fine day, Sunday.

132
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,550
In my opinion, best day of the week.

133
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,186
Why is that, Dudley?

134
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,138
Because there is no post on Sundays?

135
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,795
Right you are Harry!

136
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,388
No post on Sunday.

137
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,689
No blasted letters today!

138
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,315
No, sir.

139
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,235
Not one single bloody letter.

140
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,360
Not one!

141
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,039
No sir.

142
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,790
Not one blasted miserable...

143
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,916
No! Make it stop please!

144
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,714
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

145
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,406
Mummy, what's happening?

146
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,154
Give me that!

147
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:15,076
Give me that letter!

148
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,540
Get off!

149
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,500
They are my letters!

150
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,272
Let go of me!

151
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,380
That's it!

152
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,397
We are going away!

153
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,384
Far away!

154
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,623
Where they can't find us!

155
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,990
Daddy is gone mad, hasn't he?

156
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,129
Make a wish, Harry.

157
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:33,226
Who is there?

158
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,081
Sorry about that.

159
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:58,052
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!

160
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,636
You are breaking and entering!

161
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,043
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

162
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,240
Mind I have not seen you
since you was a baby Harry but...

163
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,088
you are a bit more along than I would have
expected particularly around the middle.

164
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,685
I am, I am not Harry.

165
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,704
I-I am.

166
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:28,396
Well, of course you are.

167
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,621
Got something for you.

168
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,170
Afraid I might have sat on it
at somepoint but...

169
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,575
I imagine it will taste fine just the same.

170
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,256
Baked it myself, words and all.

171
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,123
Thank you.

172
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,678
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

173
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:52,506
Hey...

174
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,124
Excuse me,

175
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:12,636
who are you?

176
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,253
Rubeus Hagrid,

177
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,386
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.

178
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,092
Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.

179
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:21,636
Sorry, no.

180
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,095
No?

181
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,730
Blimey, Harry didn't you ever wonder
where your mum and dad learned it all?

182
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,222
Learnt what?

183
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,543
You are a wizard, Harry.

184
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,887
I am a what?
A wizard.

185
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,775
And a thumping good one, I would wager,

186
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,238
once you are trained up little.

187
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:38,986
No.

188
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,783
You have made a mistake, I mean...

189
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:42,156
I...

190
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:43,365
can't be a-a...

191
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:44,628
a wizard.

192
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:45,910
I mean I am...

193
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:46,952
just...

194
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,109
Harry.

195
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:49,925
Just Harry.

196
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,541
Well, Just Harry,

197
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,729
did you ever make anything happen?

198
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,338
Anything you could not explain,
when you were angry or...

199
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,493
or scared?

200
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,608
Dear Mr. Potter,

201
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,497
We are pleased to inform you

202
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,362
that you have been accepted
at Hogwarts School

203
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:22,770
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

204
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,160
He will not be going there, I tell you!

205
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,068
We swore when we took him in
we would put a stop to all this rubbish.

206
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:28,953
You knew?

207
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,487
You knew all along
and you never told me?

208
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,540
Of course we knew.

209
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,690
How could you not be?

210
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:36,710
My...

211
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:39,130
perfect sister being who she was.

212
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:42,299
Oh, my mother and father were so...

213
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,971
proud the day she got her letter.

214
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,264
We have a witch in the family.

215
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,455
Isn't it wonderful?

216
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,933
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

217
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,659
A freak!

218
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:57,898
Then she met that Potter,

219
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,943
and then she had you
and I knew you would be the same.

220
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,193
Just as strange, just as...

221
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,294
abnormal.

222
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:06,365
And then, if you please,

223
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,409
she went and got herself blown up!

224
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:10,491
And we got landed with you.

225
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:11,495
Blown up?

226
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,584
You told me my parents
died in a car crash.

227
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,041
A car crash?

228
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:19,209
A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?

229
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,379
We had to say something.

230
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,006
It's an outrage!

231
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,466
It's a scandal!

232
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:24,920
He will not be going.

233
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,466
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself
is going to stop him, are you?

234
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:30,630
Muggle?

235
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,266
Non-magic folk.

236
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,658
This boy's had his name down
ever since he were born.

237
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,478
He is going to the finest school,

238
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:39,225
of witchcraft and wizardry
in the world, and...

239
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,275
he will be under the finest headmaster,

240
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,985
that Hogwarts has ever seen,

241
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:45,173
Albus Dumbledore.

242
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:49,341
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

243
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:51,118
Never...

244
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:54,232
insult Albus Dumbledore...

245
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,966
in front of me.

246
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,773
What's that tail!

247
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:10,852
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

248
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:15,893
Oh...

249
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:17,728
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone...

250
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:19,424
at Hogwarts about that.

251
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,608
Strickly speaking,
I am not allowed to do magic.

252
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:23,260
Ok.

253
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,488
We are a bit behind schedule.

254
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,496
Best be off.

255
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,104
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

256
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,181
First year students will require...

257
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,220
three sets of plain work robes...

258
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,696
one wand.

259
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,220
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

260
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,607
One pair of dragon hide gloves.

261
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,810
Hagrid, do they mean from a real dragon?

262
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,677
Oh, they don't mean a penguin, do they?

263
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,157
Crikey.

264
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:13,867
I would love a dragon.

265
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:15,368
You would like a dragon?

266
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,830
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.

267
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:19,946
Vastly misunderstood.

268
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:30,139
All students must be equipped with...

269
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:33,412
one standard size 2 pewter cauldron...

270
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,681
and may bring if they desire,

271
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:38,569
either an owl, a cat or a toad.

272
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,647
Can we find all this in London?

273
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,132
If you know where to go.

274
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,423
Hagrid!

275
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,010
The usual, I presume?

276
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,143
No thanks, Tom.
I am on official Hogwarts business.

277
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,898
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

278
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:19,683
Bless my soul.

279
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,422
It's Harry Potter!

280
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:27,858
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.

281
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,162
Welcome back.

282
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,651
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.

283
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:34,225
I can't believe I am meeting you at last.

284
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:35,670
Harry...

285
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,117
Potter.

286
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,208
Can't tell you how pleased
I am to meet you.

287
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,330
Hello professor.

288
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:42,685
I didn't see you there.

289
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:44,666
Harry, this is Professor Quirrell.

290
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,377
He will be your Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher,

291
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:48,396
at Hogwarts.

292
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:49,763
Oh, nice to meet you.

293
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,840
Fearfully...

294
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:53,427
fascinating subject.

295
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,638
N... Not that you need it, eh... Potter.

296
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:00,682
Yes well,

297
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,055
must be going now.

298
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,984
Lots to buy.

299
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,086
Goodbye.

300
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,891
See Harry? You are famous.
But why am I famous Hagrid?

301
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:13,862
All those people back there,

302
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,828
how is it they know who I am?

303
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:18,827
I am not sure I am exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

304
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:37,873
Welcome Harry,

305
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,418
to Diagon Alley.

306
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:59,014
Here is where you will get
your quills and your ink.

307
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,631
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

308
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:30,766
It's a worldclass racing broom.

309
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:31,815
Look at it!

310
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,969
The new Nimbus 2000!

311
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,054
It's the fastest model yet.

312
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,160
But Hagrid,

313
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:45,037
how am I to pay for all this?

314
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:46,712
I have not any money.

315
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,540
Well there is your money, Harry.

316
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:50,173
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

317
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,627
Tain't no safer place, not one.

318
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,337
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

319
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,618
Hagrid?

320
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:12,649
What exactly are these things?

321
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:14,172
They are goblins, Harry.

322
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,915
Clever as they come goblins
but not the most friendly of beasts.

323
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:19,667
Best stay close.

324
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:26,644
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

325
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:35,222
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

326
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,371
Oh, wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

327
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:44,488
Here is the little devil.

328
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,098
Oh and there is something else as well.

329
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,707
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

330
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,527
It's about You-Know-What,

331
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,002
in vault... You-Know-Which.

332
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,299
Very well.

333
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,179
Vault 687.

334
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,451
Lamp, please.

335
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,216
Key, please.

336
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,490
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did you?

337
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,878
Vault 713.

338
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,567
What's in there Hagrid?

339
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:00,922
Can't tell you Harry.

340
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:02,680
Hogwarts business.

341
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:04,004
Very secret.

342
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,239
Stand back.

343
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:36,237
Best not to mention this to anyone Harry.

344
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:46,968
I still need...

345
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:48,473
a wand.

346
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,263
A wand?

347
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:53,013
Well, you will want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

348
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,227
Why don't you run along there and wait.

349
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:58,036
I just got one more thing I got to do.
Won't be long.

350
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:17,433
Hello?

351
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,285
Hello?

352
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:30,449
I wondered when
I would be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

353
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,332
It seems only yesterday,

354
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:45,646
that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

355
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:55,052
Here we are.

356
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:06,084
Give it a wave.

357
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,059
Apparently not.

358
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:24,989
Perhaps...

359
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,567
this.

360
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:39,372
No, no, definitely not.

361
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:41,505
No matter.

362
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,224
I wonder...

363
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:20,865
Curious.

364
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:23,869
Very curious.

365
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:26,092
Sorry,

366
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:28,431
but what's curious?

367
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,517
I remember every wand
I have ever sold, Mr. Potter.

368
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:34,803
It so happens,

369
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,244
that the phoenix...

370
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,099
whose tail feather resides in your wand,

371
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,885
gave another feather.

372
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:44,103
Just one other.

373
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:48,595
It is curious that
you should be destined for this wand...

374
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:50,652
when its brother...

375
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,871
gave you that scar.

376
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,900
And who owned that wand?

377
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,205
We do not speak his name.

378
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:06,904
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

379
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,818
It's not always clear why.

380
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:11,756
But...

381
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,076
I think it is clear...

382
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:17,459
that we can expect great things from you.

383
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,848
After all,

384
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,849
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

385
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:25,201
did great things.

386
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:27,085
Terrible...

387
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,691
yes...

388
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,780
but great.

389
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,282
Harry! Harry!

390
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:41,313
Happy birthday.

391
00:30:49,503 --> 00:30:50,587
You alright, Harry?

392
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,126
You seem very quiet.

393
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,467
He killed my parents, didn't he?

394
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:58,006
The one who gave me this.

395
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:00,388
You know Hagrid.

396
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:02,967
I know you do.

397
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,915
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

398
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,079
Not all wizards are good.

399
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:16,512
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

400
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:19,032
there was a one wizard
who went as bad as he can go.

401
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,739
His name was V...

402
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,411
His name was V...

403
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,746
Maybe if you wrote it down?

404
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,168
No, I can't spell it.

405
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:28,958
Alright.

406
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:30,919
Voldemort.

407
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:32,400
Voldemort?

408
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,323
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

409
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:43,573
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

410
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,315
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

411
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:50,396
Anyone that stood up to him,

412
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,744
ended up dead.

413
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:55,182
Your parents fought against him.

414
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,806
Nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

415
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:05,370
Nobody,

416
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,670
not one.

417
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:08,436
Except you.

418
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:12,585
Me?

419
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:14,629
Voldemort tried to kill...

420
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,914
me?

421
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:16,965
Yes.

422
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,139
That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

423
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,222
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse,

424
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,962
and an evil curse at that.

425
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,975
What happened to V...

426
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,444
To You-Know-Who?

427
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:32,230
Well,

428
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:33,835
some say he died.

429
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:36,942
Codswallop, in my opinion.

430
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:38,403
Nope,

431
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,645
I reckon he is out there still...

432
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:43,145
too tired to carry on.

433
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:45,994
But one thing is absolutely certain.

434
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:49,278
Something about you
stumped him that night.

435
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,583
That's why you are famous.

436
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:53,973
That's why everybody knows your name.

437
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,953
You are the boy who lived.

438
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,226
What are you looking at?

439
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,859
Blimey, is that the time?

440
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,899
Sorry, Harry, I am gonna have to leave you.

441
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,922
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

442
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,111
Well, he will be wanting to see me.

443
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,487
Now...

444
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,235
your train leaves in 10 minutes.

445
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:24,532
Here is your ticket.

446
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:26,618
Stick to it, Harry that's very important.

447
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:28,009
Stick to your ticket.

448
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:33,496
Platform 9 3/4?

449
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,376
But Hagrid,

450
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,836
there must be a mistake.

451
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,223
This says platform 9 3/4.

452
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,597
There is no such thing, is there?

453
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:01,990
Sorry.

454
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:05,406
Excuse me.

455
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:06,732
Excuse me.

456
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:08,865
Right on your left Madam.

457
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:10,119
Excuse me Sir.

458
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:13,084
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

459
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:14,374
9 3/4?

460
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:15,662
Think you are being funny, do you?

461
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,001
9 3/4?
It's the same every year,

462
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:19,387
packed with Muggles of course.
Come on!

463
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,821
Muggles?
Platform 9 3/4, this way.

464
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,722
Alright Percy,

465
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,174
you first.

466
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:43,205
Fred, you next.

467
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,862
He is not Fred, I am.

468
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:47,370
Honestly woman,
you call yourself our mother?

469
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,081
Oh, I am sorry, George.

470
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,121
I am only joking. I am Fred.

471
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:02,753
Excuse me.

472
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,426
Could, could you tell me...

473
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:07,993
how to...

474
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,263
How to get onto the platform?

475
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,899
Not to worry, dear.

476
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,623
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.

477
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:16,060
Now all you have got to do...

478
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:18,730
is walk straight at the wall,

479
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,554
between platforms 9 and 10.

480
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,692
Best do it at a bit of a run
if you are nervous.

481
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:23,794
Good luck.

482
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,086
Excuse me.

483
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,337
Do you mind?

484
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,266
Everywhere else is full.

485
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,391
Not at all.

486
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:32,762
I am Ron by the way.

487
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:34,031
Ron Weasley.

488
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,805
I am Harry. Harry Potter.

489
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:38,976
So...

490
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,125
it's true!

491
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,270
I mean,

492
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:43,149
do you really have the...

493
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,524
The...
The what?

494
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:46,977
Scar?

495
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,055
Wicked!

496
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,202
Anything off the trolley, dears?

497
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:57,537
No thanks.

498
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,047
I am all set.

499
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:04,927
We will take the lot.

500
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:18,766
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?

501
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,530
They mean every flavor.

502
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,646
There is chocolate and peppermint,

503
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,447
and there is also...

504
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,691
spinach,

505
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:28,447
liver and tripe.

506
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:32,509
George sweared he got
a bogey flavoured one once!

507
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,962
These are not real
frogs, are they?

508
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,539
It's just a spell.

509
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,554
Besides, it's the cards you want.

510
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,294
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.

511
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,242
I have got about 500 myself.

512
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,198
Watch it!

513
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,971
Oh, that's rotten luck.

514
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:59,565
They ave only got one
good jump in them to begin with.

515
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,144
I have got Dumbledore!

516
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,182
I got about six of him.

517
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,807
Hey, he is gone!

518
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,360
Well, you can't expect him
to hang around all day,

519
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:12,245
can you?

520
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,780
This is Scabbers by the way.

521
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,660
Pathetic, isn't he?

522
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,136
Just a little bit.

523
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,411
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow.

524
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:21,800
Want to see?

525
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:22,647
Yeah.

526
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,198
Has anyone seen a toad?

527
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:34,557
A boy named Neville's lost one.

528
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:35,516
No.

529
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,637
Are you doing magic?

530
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:38,979
Let's see then.

531
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,643
Sunshine, daisies,

532
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,320
butter mellow.

533
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:47,601
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

534
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,694
Are you sure that's a real spell?

535
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:56,725
Well, it's not very good, is it?

536
00:38:57,496 --> 00:39:00,592
Of course, I have only tried
a few simple ones myself...

537
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,365
but they ave all worked for me.

538
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:08,259
For example.

539
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,220
Oculus Reparo.

540
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,809
That's better, isn't it?

541
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:19,720
Holy cricket,

542
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,760
you are Harry Potter!

543
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,724
I am Hermione Granger.

544
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,101
And...

545
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,303
you are?

546
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,312
I am, Ron Weasley.

547
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,657
Pleasure.

548
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,191
You two better change into robes.

549
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,009
I expect we will be arriving soon.

550
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,450
You have got dirt on your nose, by the way.

551
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:42,793
Did you know?

552
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:44,004
Just there.

553
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:59,135
Right then!
First years!

554
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,789
This way please!

555
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:03,306
Come on now, first years don't be shy.

556
00:40:04,132 --> 00:40:06,085
Come on now, hurry up. Out!

557
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:14,608
Hello Harry.

558
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:15,736
Hey Hagrid.

559
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,280
Right then. This way to the boats.

560
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:20,768
Come on now, follow me.

561
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:08,643
Wicked.

562
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,950
Welcome to Hogwarts.

563
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,008
Now, in a few moments,
you will pass through these doors,

564
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,201
and join your classmates.

565
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:45,866
But before you can take your seats,

566
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,505
you must be sorted into your houses.

567
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:50,704
They are Gryffindor,

568
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,310
Hufflepuff,

569
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,083
Ravenclaw,

570
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:56,169
and Slytherin.

571
00:41:57,843 --> 00:41:59,046
Now, while you are here,

572
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,146
your house will be like your family.

573
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:05,591
Your triumphs will earn you points.

574
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:09,935
Any rule breaking,
and you will lose points.

575
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,060
At the end of the year,

576
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,354
the house with the most points

577
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,084
is awarded the house cup.

578
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:18,060
Trevor!

579
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,114
Sorry.

580
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:31,662
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

581
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,416
It's true then,

582
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,490
what they are saying on the train.

583
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,337
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

584
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,095
Harry Potter?

585
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,091
This is Crabbe,

586
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,290
and Goyle.

587
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,118
And I am Malfoy.

588
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:50,098
Draco Malfoy.

589
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,185
Think my name's funny, do you?

590
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,004
I have no need to ask yours.

591
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,480
Red hair...

592
00:42:57,674 --> 00:42:59,106
and a handmedown robe?

593
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:01,330
You must be a Weasley.

594
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,362
We will soon find out
that some wizarding families

595
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,929
are better than others Potter.

596
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:10,007
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

597
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:12,823
I can help you there.

598
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:18,417
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

599
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:26,884
We are ready for you now.

600
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:27,894
Follow me.

601
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:47,529
It's not real, the ceiling.

602
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,367
It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

603
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,736
I read about it in Hogwarts.

604
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,017
A History.

605
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:08,768
Alright, will you wait along here, please?

606
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:12,263
Now,

607
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,051
before we begin...

608
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,278
Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

609
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:21,554
I have a few start of term notices
I wish to announce.

610
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,890
The first years, please note...

611
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:27,335
that the Dark Forest is...

612
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:30,522
strictly forbidden to all students.

613
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,784
Also, our caretaker,

614
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:34,868
Mr. Filch,

615
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:36,943
has asked me to remind you...

616
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:39,123
that the third floor corridor,

617
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,582
on the right hand side,

618
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:41,983
is out of bounds...

619
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:45,950
to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

620
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:49,094
Thank you.

621
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:53,485
When I call your name,

622
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,407
you will come forth.

623
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:58,692
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

624
00:44:59,841 --> 00:45:01,676
and you will be sorted into your houses.

625
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:04,796
Hermione Granger.

626
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,111
Oh, no.

627
00:45:09,492 --> 00:45:10,921
Ok, relax.

628
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:13,423
Mental that one, I am telling you.

629
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:21,204
Right then...

630
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,986
right.

631
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,169
Ok.

632
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,189
Gryffindor!

633
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,095
Draco Malfoy.

634
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:44,792
Slytherin!

635
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,079
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who was not in Slytherin.

636
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:51,628
Susan Bones.

637
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:02,962
Harry, what is it?

638
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,583
Nothing.

639
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,462
Nothing, I am fine.

640
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:07,462
Let's see...

641
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:09,713
I know!

642
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:11,291
Hufflepuff!

643
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,703
Ronald Weasley.

644
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,277
Another Weasley!

645
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:35,594
I know just what to do with you.

646
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,125
Gryffindor!

647
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:45,968
Harry Potter.

648
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:08,471
Difficult, very difficult.

649
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:10,644
Plenty of courage, I see.

650
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:12,733
Not a bad mind, either.

651
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:13,944
There is talent.

652
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:15,210
Oh, yes.

653
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:18,397
And a thirst to prove yourself.

654
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:21,788
But where to put you?

655
00:47:22,198 --> 00:47:23,412
Not Slytherin.

656
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,823
Not Slytherin.

657
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:26,957
Not Slytherin, eh?

658
00:47:27,238 --> 00:47:28,637
Are you sure?

659
00:47:28,696 --> 00:47:30,335
You could be great, you know.

660
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,465
It's all here, in your head.

661
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:39,206
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

662
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:40,345
No?

663
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,276
Well, if you are sure.
Please. Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

664
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,722
Not Slytherin.
Better be...

665
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:47,851
Gryffindor!

666
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,296
Your attention, please.

667
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:19,843
Let the feast...

668
00:48:20,382 --> 00:48:21,437
begin.

669
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,274
I am half and half.

670
00:48:39,836 --> 00:48:40,989
Me dad is a Muggle.

671
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,688
Mum is a witch.

672
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:45,516
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

673
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,997
Say Percy,

674
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,638
who is that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

675
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:53,460
Oh, that's Professor Snape,

676
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:54,865
head of Slytherin house.

677
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,296
What's he teach?

678
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,272
Potions.

679
00:48:57,442 --> 00:48:59,508
But everyone knows,
its the Dark Arts he fancies.

680
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:01,832
He is been after Quirrell's job for years.

681
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,433
Hello!

682
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,026
How are you?

683
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,104
Welcome to Gryffindor.

684
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,251
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

685
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:32,933
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

686
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,794
Dismal. Once again, my request

687
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:38,108
to join the Headless Hunt
has been denied.

688
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:43,302
I know you.

689
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:45,293
You are Nearly Headless Nick.

690
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:48,027
I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.

691
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,641
Nearly headless?

692
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,715
How can you be nearly headless?

693
00:49:52,017 --> 00:49:53,181
Like this.

694
00:50:04,112 --> 00:50:05,775
Gryffindors, follow me please.

695
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,376
Keep up. Thank you.

696
00:50:08,165 --> 00:50:09,369
Ravenclaw, follow me.

697
00:50:10,681 --> 00:50:11,821
This way.

698
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:15,266
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

699
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:17,628
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.

700
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:19,182
They like to change.

701
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:31,308
Keep up, please and follow me.

702
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:33,477
Quickly now, come on.

703
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:34,813
Come on.

704
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,128
That picture is moving.

705
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,815
Look at that one.
I think she fancies you.

706
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,904
Oh, look! Look!
Who is that girl?

707
00:50:46,265 --> 00:50:48,052
Welcome to Hogwarts.

708
00:51:04,818 --> 00:51:06,253
Password?

709
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:08,487
Caput Draconis.

710
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:17,729
Follow me, everyone.

711
00:51:18,073 --> 00:51:20,121
Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

712
00:51:24,003 --> 00:51:25,203
Gather around here.

713
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:30,090
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

714
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,937
Boys' dormitory is upstairs
and down to your left.

715
00:51:34,278 --> 00:51:35,687
Girls, the same on your right.

716
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:38,648
You will find that your belongings
have already been brought up.

717
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:48,457
Made it! Made it!

718
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,316
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face, if we were late?

719
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,206
That was bloody brilliant!

720
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,487
Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

721
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,651
Perhaps, it would be more useful
if I were to transfigure

722
00:53:04,676 --> 00:53:06,675
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

723
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,590
That way, one of you might be on time.

724
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:09,976
We got lost.

725
00:53:10,165 --> 00:53:11,426
Then perhaps a map?

726
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:14,565
I trust you don't need one
to find your seats.

727
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:26,024
There will be no foolish wandwaving,

728
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,751
or silly incantations in this class.

729
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:30,862
As such,

730
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:33,833
I don't expect
many of you to appreciate,

731
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:35,992
the subtle science and exact art,

732
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,226
that is potion making.

733
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:38,495
However for those...

734
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,391
select few...

735
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:42,791
who possess...

736
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,032
the predisposition...

737
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:50,173
I can teach you,

738
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,248
how to bewitch the mind...

739
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:54,467
and ensnare the senses.

740
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,058
I can tell you how to bottle fame,

741
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:01,518
brew glory and even put a stopper...

742
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,215
in death.

743
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,484
Then again,

744
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,987
maybe some of you

745
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:14,701
have come to Hogwarts
in possession of abilities

746
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:17,471
so formidable
that you feel confident enough...

747
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,244
to not...

748
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:21,119
pay attention.

749
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,693
Mr. Potter.

750
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:32,883
Our...

751
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:35,435
new celebrity.

752
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:42,665
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

753
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,064
You don't know?

754
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,887
Well, let's try again.

755
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:53,194
Where Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

756
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:57,035
I don't know, Sir.

757
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:00,153
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

758
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:04,996
I don't know, Sir.

759
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,071
Pity.

760
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,171
Clearly,

761
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,352
fame isn't everything...

762
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:16,651
is it, Mr. Potter?

763
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,845
Clearly, Hermione knows.

764
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,010
Seems a pity not to ask her.

765
00:55:22,592 --> 00:55:23,849
Silence.

766
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:37,042
Put your hand down, you silly girl.

767
00:55:41,624 --> 00:55:43,574
For your information Potter...

768
00:55:44,531 --> 00:55:47,042
asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so,

769
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:49,971
powerful it is known
as the Draught of the Living Dead.

770
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:51,544
A bezoar is a stone,

771
00:55:51,568 --> 00:55:53,122
taken from the stomach of a goat,

772
00:55:53,147 --> 00:55:55,114
and it will save you from most poisons.

773
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,133
As for monkshood and wolfsbane,

774
00:55:57,157 --> 00:56:00,495
they are the same plant,
which also goes by the name of aconite.

775
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,013
Well...

776
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:09,974
why are not you all copying this down?

777
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,995
And Gryffindors...

778
00:56:22,123 --> 00:56:25,917
note that five points will be taken
from your house...

779
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,302
for your classmate's cheek.

780
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:47,600
Eye of rabbit,

781
00:56:47,624 --> 00:56:48,768
harp string hum.

782
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,979
Turn this water into rum.

783
00:56:53,387 --> 00:56:55,425
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum.

784
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,900
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

785
00:56:58,187 --> 00:56:59,320
Turn it into rum.

786
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,406
Actually managed a weak tea yesterday,

787
00:57:01,938 --> 00:57:02,993
before...

788
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,931
Mail is here.

789
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:44,908
Can I borrow this?

790
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:46,569
Thanks.

791
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:51,206
Hey, look!

792
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,672
Neville is got a Remembrall.

793
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:54,584
I have read about those.

794
00:57:54,756 --> 00:57:56,252
When the smoke turns red,

795
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:57,946
it means you have forgotten something.

796
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:00,465
The only problem is,

797
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:02,353
I can't remember what I have forgotten.

798
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:03,635
Hey Ron!

799
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,762
Somebody broke into Gringotts.

800
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:06,871
Listen.

801
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:10,499
Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown,

802
00:58:11,065 --> 00:58:13,311
Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach,

803
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,284
insist nothing was taken.

804
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:17,899
The vault in question number 713,

805
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:20,971
had in fact been emptied earlier
that very same day.

806
00:58:22,011 --> 00:58:22,946
That's odd.

807
00:58:23,368 --> 00:58:25,251
That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.

808
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:36,543
Good afternoon, class.

809
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,830
Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

810
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:41,150
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

811
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,134
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

812
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:47,137
Well, what are you waiting for?

813
00:58:47,462 --> 00:58:49,852
Everyone step up to the left side
of their broomstick.

814
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:51,141
Come on now, hurry up.

815
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:54,394
Stick your right hand over the broom

816
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,790
and say, up.

817
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:56,876
Up!

818
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:57,665
Up!

819
00:58:58,329 --> 00:58:59,028
Up.

820
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:01,137
Up.

821
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,571
Up.

822
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:05,744
Up!

823
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:06,955
With feeling.

824
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:08,268
Up! Up!

825
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,073
Up!

826
00:59:09,323 --> 00:59:10,050
Up!

827
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:11,354
Up!

828
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:12,346
Up.

829
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:13,182
Up!

830
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:14,167
Up.

831
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,010
Shut up, Harry.

832
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:19,377
Now,

833
00:59:20,104 --> 00:59:21,588
once you have got hold of your broom,

834
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,096
I want you to mount it.

835
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:25,007
And grip it tight,

836
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:27,245
you don't wanna be sliding off the end.

837
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,470
When I blow my whistle,

838
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,889
I want each of you,

839
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:32,526
to kick off from the ground, hard.

840
00:59:33,295 --> 00:59:34,767
Keep your broom steady,

841
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,815
hover for a moment...

842
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:39,105
then lean forward slightly,

843
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:40,471
and touch back down.

844
00:59:41,802 --> 00:59:42,734
On my whistle.

845
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:44,302
Three, two...

846
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:48,537
Mr. Longbottom.

847
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:54,913
Mr-Mr-Mr-Mr. Longbottom!

848
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,494
Mr. Longbottom!
Down, down!

849
00:59:56,698 --> 00:59:58,052
Neville!

850
00:59:58,419 --> 00:59:59,193
Neville!

851
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:00,224
Neville!

852
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:01,458
Neville!

853
01:00:01,483 --> 01:00:03,026
Come back down this instant!

854
01:00:11,284 --> 01:00:12,245
Help!

855
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:15,222
Mr. Longbottom.

856
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:26,105
Help!

857
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,439
Everyone out of the way!

858
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,000
Is he alright?

859
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:45,797
Oh dear, it's a broken wrist.

860
01:00:46,414 --> 01:00:48,454
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

861
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,896
Everyone is to keep their feet

862
01:00:51,954 --> 01:00:55,161
firmly on the ground while I take
Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

863
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:56,432
Understand?

864
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,943
If I see a single broom in the air...

865
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:03,090
the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

866
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:06,059
Did you see his face?

867
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:08,820
Maybe if the fat lump
had given this a squeeze,

868
01:01:09,246 --> 01:01:10,941
he would have remembered
to fall on his fat arse.

869
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,597
Give it here Malfoy.

870
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,076
No.

871
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:17,660
I think I will leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

872
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,464
How about on the roof?

873
01:01:25,912 --> 01:01:27,130
What's the matter, Potter?

874
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:28,802
Bit beyond your reach?

875
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:33,853
Harry, no way!

876
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:35,337
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

877
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:37,860
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

878
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:41,016
What an idiot.

879
01:01:44,797 --> 01:01:47,374
Give it here Malfoy
or I will knock you off your broom!

880
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:49,570
Is that so?

881
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,875
Have it your way, then.

882
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:31,457
Nice going, Harry.
That was wicked, Harry!

883
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,723
Harry Potter!

884
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,722
Follow me.

885
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:50,425
You wait here.

886
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:55,259
Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me.

887
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:57,418
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

888
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,614
Oh yes, of course.

889
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,688
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.

890
01:03:08,442 --> 01:03:11,856
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

891
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:17,852
Have you heard?
Harry Potter is the new Gryffindor Seeker.

892
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,149
I always knew he would do well.

893
01:03:20,503 --> 01:03:21,494
Seeker?

894
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:24,407
But first years never make their house teams.

895
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,541
You must be the youngest

896
01:03:26,565 --> 01:03:28,262
Quidditch player in...
A century,

897
01:03:28,442 --> 01:03:29,501
according to McGonagall.

898
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:31,645
Hey, well done Harry.
Wood is just told us.

899
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,006
Fred and George are on the team too.

900
01:03:34,264 --> 01:03:35,177
Beaters.

901
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,185
Our job is to make sure that you

902
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:38,802
don't get bloodied up too bad.

903
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,471
Can't make any promises, of course.

904
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:41,909
Rough game, Quidditch.

905
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,350
Brutal, but no one is died in years.

906
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:46,033
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

907
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:48,120
But they will turn up in a month or two.

908
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,398
Oh, go on Harry.

909
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:52,108
Quidditch is great.

910
01:03:52,236 --> 01:03:53,568
Best game there is,

911
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:54,924
and you will be great too.

912
01:03:54,949 --> 01:03:56,696
But I have never even played Quidditch.

913
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,449
What if I make a fool of myself?

914
01:03:58,565 --> 01:04:00,158
You won't make a fool of yourself.

915
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:02,134
It's in your blood.

916
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:11,502
Harry,

917
01:04:11,705 --> 01:04:14,400
you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

918
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,455
I didn't know.

919
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:25,433
I am telling you, it's spooky.

920
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,937
She knows more about you than you do.

921
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,053
Who doesn't?

922
01:04:31,328 --> 01:04:32,452
What's happening?

923
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:35,109
The staircases change,

924
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:36,524
remember?

925
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:46,343
Let's go this way.
Before the staircase moves again.

926
01:04:55,451 --> 01:04:56,964
Does anybody feel like...

927
01:04:57,303 --> 01:04:58,624
we should not be here?

928
01:04:59,003 --> 01:05:01,302
We are not supposed to be here.

929
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:04,049
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

930
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,647
Let's go.

931
01:05:10,124 --> 01:05:11,882
It's Filch's cat!
Run!

932
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:17,735
Quick,

933
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:19,593
let's hide through that door!

934
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:26,077
It's locked!

935
01:05:26,194 --> 01:05:27,734
That's it, We are done for!

936
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:29,140
Oh, move over!

937
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:32,156
Alohomora.

938
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:34,445
Get in.

939
01:05:36,957 --> 01:05:38,202
Alohomora?

940
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:40,522
Standard Book of Spells, chapter seven.

941
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:43,124
Anyone here, my sweet?

942
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:51,950
Come on.

943
01:05:52,527 --> 01:05:53,399
Filch is gone.

944
01:05:53,423 --> 01:05:54,860
Probably thinks this door is locked.

945
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,196
It was locked.

946
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,681
And for good reason.

947
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:25,928
What do they think they are doing?

948
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:27,972
Keeping a thing like that

949
01:06:27,996 --> 01:06:29,509
locked up in a school.

950
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:31,892
You don't use your eyes, do you?

951
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,915
Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

952
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:35,813
I was not looking at its feet!

953
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:38,204
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

954
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,318
Or maybe you didn't notice.

955
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:41,493
There were three!

956
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,195
It was standing on a trap door.

957
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:44,946
Which means it was not there by accident.

958
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:46,782
It's guarding something.

959
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,071
Guarding something?

960
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:50,244
That's right.

961
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:53,270
Now, if you two don't mind,
I am going to bed...

962
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:56,611
before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

963
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,908
Or worse, expelled.

964
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,574
She needs to sort out her priorities.

965
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,685
Quidditch, is easy enough to understand.

966
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:16,580
Each team has seven players.

967
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:17,876
Three Chasers,

968
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,939
two Beaters,

969
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,566
one Keeper and a Seeker.

970
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:21,566
That's you.

971
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:29,086
There are three kinds of balls.

972
01:07:29,774 --> 01:07:31,352
This one is called the Quaffle.

973
01:07:32,058 --> 01:07:33,079
Now the Chasers,

974
01:07:33,103 --> 01:07:34,163
handle the Quaffle...

975
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:36,867
and try to put it through one
of those three hoops.

976
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:39,668
The Keeper, that's me,

977
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:41,212
defends the hoops.

978
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:42,562
With me so far?

979
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:43,839
I think so.

980
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,076
What are those?

981
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:50,646
You better take this.

982
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:03,309
Careful now, it's coming back.

983
01:08:11,204 --> 01:08:12,243
Not bad Potter.

984
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:14,870
You would make a fair Beater.

985
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,659
What was that?

986
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:35,231
Bludger.

987
01:08:36,066 --> 01:08:37,426
Nasty little buggers.

988
01:08:38,223 --> 01:08:39,103
But you...

989
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:40,879
are a Seeker.

990
01:08:45,495 --> 01:08:47,778
The only thing,
I want you to worry about...

991
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:49,452
is this.

992
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:51,655
The Golden Snitch.

993
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:54,368
I like this ball.

994
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:55,495
You like it now.

995
01:08:56,193 --> 01:08:57,079
Just wait.

996
01:08:57,573 --> 01:09:00,042
It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

997
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:02,017
What do I do with it?

998
01:09:02,524 --> 01:09:03,461
You catch it.

999
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:05,705
Before the other team's Seeker.

1000
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,103
You catch this, the game is over.

1001
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,050
You catch this Potter,

1002
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:11,912
and we win.

1003
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:24,482
One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills

1004
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,414
is levitation,

1005
01:09:26,654 --> 01:09:27,318
or...

1006
01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:30,075
the ability to make objects, fly.

1007
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:32,698
Do you have your feathers?

1008
01:09:32,973 --> 01:09:33,920
Good.

1009
01:09:34,062 --> 01:09:34,909
Now,

1010
01:09:35,444 --> 01:09:38,733
don't forget the nice wrist movement
we have been practicing.

1011
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,332
The swish and flick.

1012
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:42,538
Everyone.

1013
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:45,836
The swish and flick.

1014
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,042
Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

1015
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,009
Wingardium Leviosa.

1016
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,541
Off you go, then.

1017
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,705
Wingardium Leviosa.

1018
01:09:57,879 --> 01:10:00,119
Wingardium Leviosa.

1019
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,972
Wingardium Leviosar.

1020
01:10:04,058 --> 01:10:05,606
No, stop, stop, stop!

1021
01:10:06,058 --> 01:10:08,293
You are going to take someone is eye out.

1022
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:10,694
Besides, you are saying it wrong.

1023
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:12,738
It's Leviosa,

1024
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:14,947
not Leviosar.

1025
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:17,076
You do it then, if you are so clever.

1026
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,283
Go on, go on.

1027
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:22,604
Wingardium Leviosa.

1028
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,092
Oh, well done!

1029
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:36,152
See here everyone,
Miss Granger is done it!

1030
01:10:36,374 --> 01:10:37,559
Splendid!

1031
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,255
Wingardium Leviosa.

1032
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,551
Well done, dear.
Wingar...

1033
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:49,606
I think we are going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

1034
01:10:57,108 --> 01:10:59,285
It's Leviosa,

1035
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:01,296
not Leviosar.

1036
01:11:01,773 --> 01:11:03,581
She is a nightmare, honestly!

1037
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:05,859
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

1038
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:09,039
I think she heard you.

1039
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,529
Where is Hermione?

1040
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:44,271
Parvati Patil said that she would not
come out of the girl's bathroom.

1041
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:47,654
She said that she had been in there
all afternoon, crying.

1042
01:11:53,197 --> 01:11:54,423
Troll!

1043
01:11:54,715 --> 01:11:56,176
In the dungeon!

1044
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:59,294
Troll in the dungeon!

1045
01:12:03,048 --> 01:12:04,388
Thought you ought to know.

1046
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,340
Silence!

1047
01:12:16,748 --> 01:12:18,277
Everyone will please,

1048
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:19,660
not panic!

1049
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:22,150
Now...

1050
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:24,078
prefects,

1051
01:12:24,234 --> 01:12:27,244
will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

1052
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:29,416
Teachers,

1053
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,878
will follow me to the dungeons.

1054
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:45,683
Gryffindors keep up,

1055
01:12:45,707 --> 01:12:47,581
please and stay alert.

1056
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,464
How could a troll get in?

1057
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:52,189
Not on its own.
Trolls are really stupid.

1058
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:54,233
Probably people playing jokes.

1059
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:56,652
What?
Hermione!

1060
01:12:56,676 --> 01:12:57,926
She doesn't know.

1061
01:13:11,156 --> 01:13:13,123
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

1062
01:13:18,466 --> 01:13:20,420
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

1063
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,037
Hermione, move!

1064
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,213
Help!

1065
01:13:59,345 --> 01:14:00,654
Help!

1066
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:04,178
Hey,

1067
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:05,490
pea brain!

1068
01:14:18,113 --> 01:14:18,938
Help!

1069
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:42,339
Do something!

1070
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:45,427
What?

1071
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:47,473
Anything!

1072
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:50,307
Hurry up!

1073
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:51,886
Swish and flick.

1074
01:14:52,143 --> 01:14:54,409
Wingardium Leviosa.

1075
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:06,185
Cool.

1076
01:15:31,555 --> 01:15:33,506
Is it... dead?

1077
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,519
I don't think so.

1078
01:15:36,396 --> 01:15:37,396
Just knocked out.

1079
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,239
Troll bogies.

1080
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:49,333
Ok.

1081
01:15:49,515 --> 01:15:50,576
Oh, my goodness!

1082
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,405
Explain yourselves, both of you!

1083
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,746
Well, what it is...

1084
01:15:54,771 --> 01:15:56,890
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

1085
01:16:00,217 --> 01:16:01,307
Miss Granger?

1086
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:03,797
I went looking for the troll.

1087
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:06,354
I had read about them
and thought I could handle it.

1088
01:16:07,548 --> 01:16:08,759
But I was wrong.

1089
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:12,014
If Harry and Ron had not come
and found me,

1090
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:14,563
I would probably be dead.

1091
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:16,947
Be that as it may,

1092
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,099
it was an extremely foolish thing to do.

1093
01:16:20,402 --> 01:16:23,041
I would have expected more
rational behavior on your part

1094
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:25,509
and am very disappointed
in you, Ms. Granger.

1095
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:28,746
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

1096
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:31,729
for your serious lack of judgment.

1097
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:35,128
As for you two gentlemen...

1098
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,256
I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

1099
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:42,832
Not many first year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

1100
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,699
and live to tell the tale.

1101
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:47,175
Five points...

1102
01:16:49,695 --> 01:16:51,703
will be awarded to each of you...

1103
01:16:54,395 --> 01:16:56,390
for sheer dumb luck.

1104
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:04,204
Perhaps you ought to go.

1105
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:05,765
It might wake up.

1106
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,788
Good of you to get us
out of trouble like that.

1107
01:17:18,073 --> 01:17:20,455
Mind you, we did save her life.

1108
01:17:20,565 --> 01:17:24,096
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you had not insulted her.

1109
01:17:25,314 --> 01:17:27,049
What are friends for?

1110
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,491
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

1111
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:34,972
Ron is right Harry.

1112
01:17:34,996 --> 01:17:36,643
You are gonna need your strength today.

1113
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:38,393
I am not hungry.

1114
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:41,269
Good luck today, Potter.

1115
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:45,736
Then again, now that you have
proven yourself against a troll.

1116
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:48,158
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

1117
01:17:49,215 --> 01:17:51,182
Even if it is against, Slytherin.

1118
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,415
That explains the blood.

1119
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:03,384
Blood?

1120
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,836
Listen, last night.

1121
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,525
I am guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion.

1122
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,994
So he could try and get past
that 3 headed dog.

1123
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:11,758
But,

1124
01:18:11,782 --> 01:18:14,018
he got himself bitten,
that's why he is limping.

1125
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,344
But why would anyone go near that dog?

1126
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:20,196
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

1127
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,751
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

1128
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,339
So you are saying...

1129
01:18:25,364 --> 01:18:26,898
That's what the dog is guarding.

1130
01:18:26,922 --> 01:18:28,518
That's what Snape wants.

1131
01:18:42,839 --> 01:18:44,416
Bit early for mail, isn't it?

1132
01:18:44,763 --> 01:18:46,979
But I... I never get mail.

1133
01:18:47,464 --> 01:18:48,721
Let's open it.

1134
01:18:58,961 --> 01:19:00,378
It's a broomstick.

1135
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:03,435
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,

1136
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,448
it's a Nimbus 2000!

1137
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:07,886
But who...?

1138
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,463
Scared Harry?

1139
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:32,839
A little.

1140
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,091
That's alright.

1141
01:19:34,714 --> 01:19:36,557
I felt the same way
before my first game.

1142
01:19:36,866 --> 01:19:37,886
What happened?

1143
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:40,612
I don't really remember.

1144
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:42,745
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

1145
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:45,388
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

1146
01:20:08,778 --> 01:20:12,277
<i>Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.</i>

1147
01:20:12,348 --> 01:20:15,678
<i>Today is game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!</i>

1148
01:20:47,457 --> 01:20:49,040
<i>The players take their positions</i>

1149
01:20:49,064 --> 01:20:51,376
<i>as madam Hooch
steps out onto the field,</i>

1150
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,290
<i>to begin the game!</i>

1151
01:20:54,064 --> 01:20:56,446
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

1152
01:20:57,736 --> 01:20:59,087
from all of you!

1153
01:21:05,673 --> 01:21:06,850
<i>The Bludgers are up,</i>

1154
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:08,423
<i>followed by the Golden Snitch.</i>

1155
01:21:08,686 --> 01:21:11,337
<i>Remember the Snitch
is worth 150 points.</i>

1156
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,204
<i>The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.</i>

1157
01:21:21,572 --> 01:21:22,866
<i>The Quaffle is released,</i>

1158
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:25,111
<i>and the game begins!</i>

1159
01:21:44,207 --> 01:21:46,139
<i>Angelina Johnson scores!</i>

1160
01:21:46,163 --> 01:21:47,926
<i>Ten points for Gryffindor!</i>

1161
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:52,103
Yes.

1162
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:55,570
Well done!

1163
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:02,072
<i>Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.</i>

1164
01:22:02,181 --> 01:22:04,267
<i>Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.</i>

1165
01:22:36,742 --> 01:22:37,460
Yes.

1166
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:40,112
<i>Another 10 points to Gryffindor!</i>

1167
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:55,347
Give me that!

1168
01:23:27,687 --> 01:23:29,173
Take that side!

1169
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:21,619
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

1170
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:34,142
It's Snape.
He is jinxing the broom!

1171
01:24:34,372 --> 01:24:35,517
Jinxing the broom?

1172
01:24:35,752 --> 01:24:37,314
What do we do?
Leave it to me.

1173
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,985
Come on, Hermione!

1174
01:25:16,117 --> 01:25:18,607
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

1175
01:25:26,878 --> 01:25:27,652
Fire!

1176
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,482
You are on fire!

1177
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,030
Go, go, go, go!

1178
01:26:41,954 --> 01:26:43,354
Looks like he is gonna be sick.

1179
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:46,988
<i>He is got the Snitch!</i>

1180
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:50,637
<i>Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!</i>

1181
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,090
Gryffindor wins!

1182
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:02,879
Yes!

1183
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:37,907
Nonsense!

1184
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:40,975
Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

1185
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,912
Who knows?

1186
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,733
Why was he trying to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween?

1187
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,666
Who told you about Fluffy?

1188
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,678
Fluffy?

1189
01:27:47,854 --> 01:27:49,585
That thing has a name?

1190
01:27:49,726 --> 01:27:51,538
Of course he is got a name. He is mine.

1191
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:54,530
I bought him off an Irish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

1192
01:27:54,855 --> 01:27:56,634
Then I lent him to Dumbledore
to guard the...

1193
01:27:56,658 --> 01:27:57,332
Yes?

1194
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:59,307
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

1195
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:00,805
Don't ask any more questions.

1196
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:02,438
That's top secret, that is.

1197
01:28:02,463 --> 01:28:04,851
But Hagrid,
whatever Fluffy is guarding,

1198
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,438
Snape is trying to steal it.

1199
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:07,687
Codswallop.

1200
01:28:08,133 --> 01:28:10,557
Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

1201
01:28:10,609 --> 01:28:12,233
Hogwarts teacher or not,

1202
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,235
I know a spell when I see one.

1203
01:28:14,518 --> 01:28:15,830
I have read all about them.

1204
01:28:16,019 --> 01:28:17,488
You have got to keep eye contact,

1205
01:28:17,512 --> 01:28:19,557
and Snape was not blinking.

1206
01:28:19,678 --> 01:28:20,744
Exactly.

1207
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:23,870
Now you listen to me,

1208
01:28:23,894 --> 01:28:25,244
all three of you.

1209
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:28,082
You are meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in.

1210
01:28:28,744 --> 01:28:30,018
It's dangerous.

1211
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:33,713
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore

1212
01:28:33,737 --> 01:28:35,063
and Nicholas Flamel.

1213
01:28:35,723 --> 01:28:37,016
Nicholas Flamel?

1214
01:28:38,232 --> 01:28:39,385
I should not have said that.

1215
01:28:39,544 --> 01:28:41,513
I should not have said that.

1216
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:44,015
Nicholas Flamel.

1217
01:28:44,935 --> 01:28:46,693
Who is Nicholas Flamel?

1218
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:48,432
I don't know.

1219
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,458
<i>♪ Merry Christmas spell ♪</i>

1220
01:29:10,482 --> 01:29:14,253
<i>♪ Merry Christmas ring the Hogwart bell ♪</i>

1221
01:29:14,278 --> 01:29:17,331
<i>♪ Merry Christmas Merry Christmas. ♪</i>

1222
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,837
<i>♪ Cast a Christmas spell. ♪</i>

1223
01:29:33,885 --> 01:29:35,735
Knight to E5.

1224
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:46,462
Queen to E5.

1225
01:29:52,568 --> 01:29:54,268
That's totally barbaric!

1226
01:29:54,693 --> 01:29:56,462
That's wizard's chess.

1227
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:58,492
I see you have packed.

1228
01:29:58,665 --> 01:29:59,962
I see you have not.

1229
01:30:00,278 --> 01:30:03,261
Change of plans. My parents decided
to go to Romania,

1230
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:05,235
to visit my brother Charlie.

1231
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,098
He is studying dragons there.

1232
01:30:07,454 --> 01:30:09,482
Good. You can help Harry then.

1233
01:30:09,623 --> 01:30:11,185
He is going to go and look in the library,

1234
01:30:11,427 --> 01:30:13,310
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

1235
01:30:13,335 --> 01:30:15,489
We have looked a hundred times!

1236
01:30:17,503 --> 01:30:19,318
Not in the restricted section.

1237
01:30:20,474 --> 01:30:21,535
Happy Christmas.

1238
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:27,270
I think we have had
a bad influence on her.

1239
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:31,706
Harry, wake up!

1240
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,527
Come on Harry, wake up!

1241
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,887
Happy Christmas, Harry.

1242
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,144
Happy Christmas, Ron.

1243
01:30:48,124 --> 01:30:49,121
What are you wearing?

1244
01:30:50,964 --> 01:30:52,560
Oh, my mum made it.

1245
01:30:53,143 --> 01:30:54,753
Looks like you have got one too.

1246
01:30:55,677 --> 01:30:56,939
I have got presents?

1247
01:30:57,182 --> 01:30:58,151
Yeah.

1248
01:31:05,517 --> 01:31:06,776
There they are.

1249
01:31:18,842 --> 01:31:21,529
Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

1250
01:31:22,175 --> 01:31:23,883
It is time it was returned to you.

1251
01:31:24,836 --> 01:31:25,880
Use it well.

1252
01:31:43,262 --> 01:31:44,195
What is it?

1253
01:31:44,829 --> 01:31:46,720
Some kind of cloak.

1254
01:31:47,332 --> 01:31:49,168
Well, let's see then. Put it on.

1255
01:31:55,795 --> 01:31:56,988
My body is gone!

1256
01:31:57,185 --> 01:31:58,709
I know what that is.

1257
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:00,800
That's an invisibility cloak!

1258
01:32:01,324 --> 01:32:02,543
I am invisible?

1259
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:04,882
They are really rare.

1260
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:08,443
I wonder who gave it to you.

1261
01:32:08,468 --> 01:32:09,594
There was no name.

1262
01:32:10,084 --> 01:32:11,055
It just said...

1263
01:32:12,201 --> 01:32:13,287
Use it well.

1264
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:43,212
Famous FireEaters.

1265
01:32:43,924 --> 01:32:46,081
FifteenthCentury Fiends.

1266
01:32:47,446 --> 01:32:48,301
Flamel.

1267
01:32:48,815 --> 01:32:50,052
Nicholas Flamel.

1268
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:51,947
Where are you?

1269
01:33:12,193 --> 01:33:13,335
Who is there?

1270
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,626
I know you are in there.

1271
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,834
You can't hide.

1272
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:34,180
Who is it?

1273
01:33:34,857 --> 01:33:36,123
Show yourself.

1274
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,037
Severus, I...

1275
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,326
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

1276
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,871
I don't know what you mean.
You know perfectly well what I mean.

1277
01:34:52,217 --> 01:34:54,422
We will have another little chat soon.

1278
01:34:55,623 --> 01:35:00,022
When you have had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

1279
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,268
Professors.

1280
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,812
I found this, in the restricted section.

1281
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:07,560
It's still hot.

1282
01:35:07,977 --> 01:35:10,044
That means there is a student out of bed.

1283
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:44,274
Mum?

1284
01:36:48,673 --> 01:36:49,485
Dad?

1285
01:37:25,231 --> 01:37:25,953
Ron?

1286
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:28,688
You have really got to see this!
Ron, you have got to see this!

1287
01:37:31,991 --> 01:37:32,770
Ron?

1288
01:37:33,258 --> 01:37:35,090
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

1289
01:37:35,115 --> 01:37:35,895
Why?

1290
01:37:35,984 --> 01:37:38,508
There is something you have got to see.
Now, come on!

1291
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:46,682
Come on! Come!

1292
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:48,596
Come look, it's my parents!

1293
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:52,760
I only see us.

1294
01:37:53,212 --> 01:37:55,211
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

1295
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:57,651
There.

1296
01:37:57,675 --> 01:37:58,861
You see them, don't you?

1297
01:37:59,095 --> 01:38:00,279
That's me!

1298
01:38:00,782 --> 01:38:02,930
Only I am head boy.

1299
01:38:03,463 --> 01:38:05,266
And I am holding the Quidditch Cup.

1300
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:07,620
And bloody hell!

1301
01:38:07,878 --> 01:38:09,726
I am Quidditch captain too!

1302
01:38:11,426 --> 01:38:12,609
I look good.

1303
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,252
Harry,

1304
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:17,515
do you think this mirror shows the future?

1305
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,423
How can it?

1306
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:22,198
Both my parents are dead.

1307
01:38:36,962 --> 01:38:38,162
Do you like yours, Ron?

1308
01:38:43,255 --> 01:38:44,107
Ron?

1309
01:38:44,795 --> 01:38:46,142
I will be right back.

1310
01:38:57,111 --> 01:38:58,342
Wanna play chess?

1311
01:38:59,884 --> 01:39:00,689
No.

1312
01:39:00,725 --> 01:39:02,091
Wanna go and visit Hagrid?

1313
01:39:03,056 --> 01:39:03,963
No.

1314
01:39:05,418 --> 01:39:07,221
Harry, I know what you are thinking,

1315
01:39:07,245 --> 01:39:08,197
but don't.

1316
01:39:09,117 --> 01:39:11,387
There is something not right
about that mirror.

1317
01:39:40,315 --> 01:39:42,400
Back again, Harry?

1318
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:48,362
I see that you,
like so many before you...

1319
01:39:48,387 --> 01:39:51,339
have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

1320
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:56,220
I trust by now you realize what it does.

1321
01:39:58,134 --> 01:39:59,657
Let me give you a clue.

1322
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:03,445
The happiest man on earth...

1323
01:40:03,727 --> 01:40:06,673
would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

1324
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,094
exactly as he is.

1325
01:40:09,852 --> 01:40:12,578
So then, it shows us what we want.

1326
01:40:13,326 --> 01:40:14,607
Whatever we want.

1327
01:40:15,107 --> 01:40:15,956
Yes.

1328
01:40:16,692 --> 01:40:17,560
And no.

1329
01:40:18,794 --> 01:40:21,075
It shows us, nothing more or less...

1330
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,763
than the deepest and most...

1331
01:40:23,905 --> 01:40:26,388
desperate desires of our hearts.

1332
01:40:27,873 --> 01:40:29,178
Now you, Harry,

1333
01:40:29,763 --> 01:40:31,560
who have never known your family...

1334
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:33,849
you see them...

1335
01:40:34,377 --> 01:40:35,721
standing beside you.

1336
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:38,314
But remember this, Harry.

1337
01:40:39,385 --> 01:40:40,522
This mirror...

1338
01:40:41,728 --> 01:40:42,941
gives us neither...

1339
01:40:43,627 --> 01:40:44,666
knowledge...

1340
01:40:45,338 --> 01:40:46,322
or truth.

1341
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:51,325
Men have wasted away in front of it.

1342
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:53,575
Even gone mad.

1343
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:57,414
That is why, tomorrow...

1344
01:40:57,438 --> 01:40:59,184
it will be moved to a new home.

1345
01:40:59,967 --> 01:41:01,381
And I must ask you...

1346
01:41:02,654 --> 01:41:05,521
not to go looking for it again.

1347
01:41:07,334 --> 01:41:10,467
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

1348
01:41:11,049 --> 01:41:13,170
and forget to live.

1349
01:42:09,913 --> 01:42:10,981
Hi, Hedwig.

1350
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,867
Look at you,

1351
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:16,243
playing with your cards.

1352
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:17,495
Pathetic!

1353
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,971
We have got final exams coming up soon.

1354
01:42:20,315 --> 01:42:21,290
I am ready.

1355
01:42:21,314 --> 01:42:22,999
Ask me any question.

1356
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,181
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial
ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?

1357
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:28,603
I forgot.

1358
01:42:28,827 --> 01:42:32,026
And what may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

1359
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,099
Copy off you.
No, you won't.

1360
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,805
Besides, according to Professor McGonagall,

1361
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:38,390
we are to be given special quills

1362
01:42:38,414 --> 01:42:40,258
bewitched with an AntiCheating Spell.

1363
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:41,852
That's insulting!

1364
01:42:42,008 --> 01:42:43,729
It's as if they don't trust us!

1365
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:45,641
Dumbledore again!

1366
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,154
LegLocker Curse?

1367
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:53,703
Malfoy.

1368
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:03,000
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

1369
01:43:03,025 --> 01:43:03,790
How?

1370
01:43:03,814 --> 01:43:06,024
I can barely stand at all!

1371
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,587
I will do the countercurse!

1372
01:43:08,887 --> 01:43:10,505
No, that's all I need!

1373
01:43:10,587 --> 01:43:12,915
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

1374
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:17,134
I don't appreciate
the insinuation Longbottom.

1375
01:43:17,345 --> 01:43:18,430
Besides,

1376
01:43:18,454 --> 01:43:20,575
if anyone cared to notice...

1377
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,587
my eyebrows have completely grown back!

1378
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:29,650
I found him!

1379
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,037
Dumbledore is particularly famous
for his defeat

1380
01:43:33,062 --> 01:43:35,999
of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.

1381
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,680
Go on!

1382
01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:39,193
For the discovery of the twelve uses
of dragon blood...

1383
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,615
and his work on alchemy
with his partner, Nicholas Flamel!

1384
01:43:42,849 --> 01:43:44,623
I knew the name sound familiar.

1385
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:46,275
I read it on the train that day.

1386
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,349
Follow me!

1387
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,215
Hey!

1388
01:43:53,449 --> 01:43:54,174
Wait!

1389
01:43:54,972 --> 01:43:56,308
Where are you going?

1390
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,785
What about the countercurse?

1391
01:44:02,863 --> 01:44:04,977
I had you looking in the wrong section.

1392
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:07,488
How could I be so stupid?

1393
01:44:08,652 --> 01:44:11,598
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

1394
01:44:12,056 --> 01:44:13,735
This is light?

1395
01:44:19,103 --> 01:44:20,117
Of course!

1396
01:44:20,141 --> 01:44:21,228
Here it is!

1397
01:44:21,329 --> 01:44:23,745
Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker

1398
01:44:23,769 --> 01:44:25,484
of the Sorcerer's Stone.

1399
01:44:25,532 --> 01:44:26,932
The what?
The what?

1400
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,312
Honestly, don't you two read?

1401
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,088
The Sorcerer's Stone
is a legendary substance,

1402
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,845
with astonishing powers.

1403
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:37,728
It will transform any metal into pure gold...

1404
01:44:38,056 --> 01:44:39,928
and produces the Elixir of Life...

1405
01:44:40,209 --> 01:44:41,932
which will make the drinker immortal.

1406
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,181
Immortal?

1407
01:44:43,205 --> 01:44:44,499
It means you will never die.

1408
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,159
I know what it means!

1409
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:50,314
The only Stone currently in existence

1410
01:44:50,338 --> 01:44:52,399
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

1411
01:44:52,626 --> 01:44:53,859
the noted alchemist,

1412
01:44:53,883 --> 01:44:57,881
who last year celebrated
his 665th birthday.

1413
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,604
That's what Fluffy is guarding
on the 3rd floor.

1414
01:45:01,769 --> 01:45:03,410
That's what's under the trap door.

1415
01:45:03,691 --> 01:45:05,135
The Sorcerer's Stone.

1416
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:24,014
Hagrid.
Oh hello.

1417
01:45:24,172 --> 01:45:27,274
Sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I am in no fit state to entertain today.

1418
01:45:27,317 --> 01:45:29,266
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

1419
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,542
We think Snape is trying to steal it.

1420
01:45:36,567 --> 01:45:37,402
Snape?

1421
01:45:37,534 --> 01:45:39,480
Blimey, you are not
still on about him, are you?

1422
01:45:40,019 --> 01:45:43,000
Hagrid, we know he is after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

1423
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,952
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone.

1424
01:45:46,402 --> 01:45:48,480
He is not about to steal it.
What?

1425
01:45:48,605 --> 01:45:49,623
You heard.

1426
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:52,728
Right. Come on now,
I am a bit preoccupied today.

1427
01:45:52,753 --> 01:45:53,668
Wait a minute.

1428
01:45:54,065 --> 01:45:55,299
One of the teachers?

1429
01:45:55,542 --> 01:45:56,505
Of course!

1430
01:45:56,529 --> 01:45:58,382
There are other things
defending the Stone,

1431
01:45:58,406 --> 01:45:59,399
are not there?

1432
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,967
Spells, enchantments.

1433
01:46:00,991 --> 01:46:01,979
That's right.

1434
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:04,427
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

1435
01:46:05,325 --> 01:46:07,278
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

1436
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:09,393
Ain't a soul knows how,

1437
01:46:09,417 --> 01:46:11,208
except for me and Dumbledore.

1438
01:46:11,817 --> 01:46:13,188
I should not have told you that.

1439
01:46:13,213 --> 01:46:14,668
I should not have told you that.

1440
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,080
Hagrid,

1441
01:46:30,336 --> 01:46:31,581
what exactly is that?

1442
01:46:31,605 --> 01:46:32,969
That? It's...

1443
01:46:33,446 --> 01:46:34,407
It's...

1444
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,165
I know what that is!

1445
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:37,836
But Hagrid,

1446
01:46:38,188 --> 01:46:39,600
how did you get one?

1447
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,674
I won it.

1448
01:46:40,698 --> 01:46:42,612
Off a stranger I met down at the pub.

1449
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,174
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

1450
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,700
Is that...

1451
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:13,799
a dragon?

1452
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,706
That's not just a dragon.

1453
01:47:16,027 --> 01:47:17,941
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

1454
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,599
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

1455
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,883
Isn't he beautiful?

1456
01:47:23,363 --> 01:47:25,449
Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

1457
01:47:27,246 --> 01:47:28,636
Hello, Norbert.

1458
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,140
Norbert?

1459
01:47:30,504 --> 01:47:32,400
Yeah well, he is got
to have a name, don't he?

1460
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:35,772
Don't you, Norbert?

1461
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:45,773
He will have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

1462
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,757
Who is that?

1463
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:55,616
Malfoy.

1464
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,437
Oh, dear.

1465
01:48:00,258 --> 01:48:02,255
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.

1466
01:48:02,812 --> 01:48:04,702
He told me so the first time I met him.

1467
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,760
It's crazy.

1468
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:09,366
And worse, Malfoy knows.

1469
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,073
I don't understand.

1470
01:48:11,097 --> 01:48:13,147
Is that bad?
It's bad.

1471
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,304
Good evening.

1472
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,467
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

1473
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,200
gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

1474
01:48:26,872 --> 01:48:29,157
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,

1475
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:31,568
50 points will be taken.

1476
01:48:32,029 --> 01:48:33,036
50?

1477
01:48:33,263 --> 01:48:34,239
Each.

1478
01:48:35,372 --> 01:48:37,653
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

1479
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,223
all four of you will receive detention.

1480
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,380
Excuse me professor,

1481
01:48:43,574 --> 01:48:44,925
perhaps I heard you wrong.

1482
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,300
I thought you said the four of us.

1483
01:48:47,925 --> 01:48:50,238
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

1484
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,723
You see, honorable as your intentions were,

1485
01:48:52,747 --> 01:48:55,295
you too were out of bed after hours.

1486
01:48:56,108 --> 01:48:58,717
You will join your classmates
in detention.

1487
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:12,895
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

1488
01:49:14,018 --> 01:49:18,236
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

1489
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,371
God, I miss the screaming.

1490
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:27,622
You will be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

1491
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,093
He is got a little job to do...

1492
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:32,582
inside the Dark Forest.

1493
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,543
A sorry lot this Hagrid.

1494
01:49:40,203 --> 01:49:43,921
Oh, good God, man, you are not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

1495
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:48,580
Norbert is gone.

1496
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,948
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania,

1497
01:49:52,346 --> 01:49:53,564
to live in a colony.

1498
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:55,368
Well, that's good, isn't it?

1499
01:49:55,392 --> 01:49:56,993
He will be with his own kind.

1500
01:49:57,321 --> 01:49:59,220
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

1501
01:49:59,793 --> 01:50:01,791
What if the other dragons
are mean to him?

1502
01:50:02,602 --> 01:50:04,376
He is only a baby, after all.

1503
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,339
Oh, for God's sake,
pull yourself together, man.

1504
01:50:07,363 --> 01:50:09,431
You are going into the Forest, after all.

1505
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,072
Got to have your wits about you.

1506
01:50:12,675 --> 01:50:13,803
The Forest?

1507
01:50:13,892 --> 01:50:15,305
I thought that was a joke.

1508
01:50:16,103 --> 01:50:17,312
We can't go in there.

1509
01:50:18,716 --> 01:50:20,477
Students are not allowed.

1510
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:21,961
And there are...

1511
01:50:24,398 --> 01:50:25,586
werewolves.

1512
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,534
There is more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

1513
01:50:29,472 --> 01:50:30,831
You can be sure of that.

1514
01:50:34,173 --> 01:50:35,173
Nightynight.

1515
01:50:38,017 --> 01:50:38,857
Right.

1516
01:50:40,064 --> 01:50:41,025
Let's go.

1517
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:21,182
Hagrid, what is that?

1518
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:22,664
What we are here for.

1519
01:51:23,471 --> 01:51:24,424
See that?

1520
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,252
That's unicorn blood, that is.

1521
01:51:28,502 --> 01:51:30,620
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

1522
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:32,173
Now,

1523
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:35,362
this one is been hurt bad by something.

1524
01:51:43,636 --> 01:51:44,394
So,

1525
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:46,563
it's our job...

1526
01:51:47,753 --> 01:51:49,268
to go and find the poor beast.

1527
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:51,456
Ron, Hermione, you will come with me.

1528
01:51:51,714 --> 01:51:52,496
Ok.

1529
01:51:53,177 --> 01:51:54,070
And Harry,

1530
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:55,495
you will go with Malfoy.

1531
01:51:57,894 --> 01:51:59,659
Ok. Then I get Fang.

1532
01:52:00,155 --> 01:52:00,869
Fine.

1533
01:52:01,725 --> 01:52:02,871
Just so you know,

1534
01:52:03,678 --> 01:52:04,920
he is a bloody coward.

1535
01:52:09,742 --> 01:52:11,754
You wait till my father hears about this.

1536
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:13,953
This is servant's stuff.

1537
01:52:14,851 --> 01:52:16,801
If I didn't know better, Draco,

1538
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:18,625
I would say you were scared.

1539
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,821
I am not scared, Potter.

1540
01:52:22,586 --> 01:52:23,759
Did you hear that?

1541
01:52:26,857 --> 01:52:28,134
Come on, Fang.

1542
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,668
Scared!

1543
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,426
What is it, Fang?

1544
01:54:07,869 --> 01:54:10,540
Harry Potter, you must leave.

1545
01:54:11,431 --> 01:54:13,236
You are known to many creatures here.

1546
01:54:13,626 --> 01:54:15,752
The Forest is not safe at this time.

1547
01:54:16,485 --> 01:54:17,696
Especially for you.

1548
01:54:17,923 --> 01:54:20,290
What was that thing you saved me from?

1549
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,468
A monstrous creature.

1550
01:54:23,157 --> 01:54:26,099
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

1551
01:54:26,282 --> 01:54:31,343
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

1552
01:54:32,124 --> 01:54:33,813
But at a terrible price.

1553
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:36,710
You have slain something so pure...

1554
01:54:37,356 --> 01:54:39,861
that from the moment the blood touches
your lips,

1555
01:54:40,426 --> 01:54:42,035
you will have a halflife.

1556
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:43,778
A cursed life.

1557
01:54:44,504 --> 01:54:46,284
But who would choose such a life?

1558
01:54:46,308 --> 01:54:47,723
Can you think of no one?

1559
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:49,954
Do you mean to say...

1560
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:53,364
that thing that killed the unicorn...

1561
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,376
that was drinking its blood,

1562
01:54:56,512 --> 01:54:57,932
that was Voldemort?

1563
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:01,909
Do you know what is hidden in the school
at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

1564
01:55:03,932 --> 01:55:05,564
The Sorcerer's Stone.

1565
01:55:06,965 --> 01:55:07,989
Harry!

1566
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:10,516
Hello there, Firenze.

1567
01:55:11,036 --> 01:55:12,981
See you have met our young Mr. Potter.

1568
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,481
You alright there, Harry?

1569
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,524
Harry Potter,

1570
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:20,557
this is where I leave you.

1571
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,946
You are safe now.

1572
01:55:25,042 --> 01:55:26,065
Good luck.

1573
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,541
You mean You-Know-Who

1574
01:55:35,565 --> 01:55:38,186
is out there right now in the Forest?

1575
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,253
But he is weak.

1576
01:55:39,491 --> 01:55:41,006
He is living off the unicorns.

1577
01:55:41,436 --> 01:55:42,507
Don't you see?

1578
01:55:42,725 --> 01:55:44,061
We had it wrong.

1579
01:55:44,538 --> 01:55:46,511
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.

1580
01:55:46,678 --> 01:55:48,499
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1581
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,804
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1582
01:55:52,031 --> 01:55:52,913
He will...

1583
01:55:53,929 --> 01:55:54,889
come back.

1584
01:55:55,671 --> 01:55:57,397
But if he comes back...

1585
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,023
you don't think he will try to...

1586
01:56:00,273 --> 01:56:01,679
kill you, do you?

1587
01:56:02,976 --> 01:56:05,406
I think if he would had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

1588
01:56:06,398 --> 01:56:07,615
And to think,

1589
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:10,099
I have been worrying
about my Potions final.

1590
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:11,494
Hang on a minute.

1591
01:56:11,518 --> 01:56:13,293
We are forgetting one thing.

1592
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:17,600
Who is the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1593
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,837
Dumbledore.

1594
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:23,297
As long as Dumbledore is around Harry,

1595
01:56:23,321 --> 01:56:24,465
you are safe.

1596
01:56:25,145 --> 01:56:26,759
As long as Dumbledore is around,

1597
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,600
you can't be touched.

1598
01:56:34,872 --> 01:56:37,228
I had always heard Hogwarts'
end of the year exams

1599
01:56:37,252 --> 01:56:40,536
were frightful but,
I found that rather enjoyable.

1600
01:56:40,567 --> 01:56:42,066
Speak for yourself.

1601
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:43,848
Alright there Harry?

1602
01:56:44,432 --> 01:56:45,403
My scar.

1603
01:56:45,948 --> 01:56:47,363
It keeps burning.

1604
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:49,675
It's happened before.

1605
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:51,075
Not like this.

1606
01:56:51,099 --> 01:56:52,748
Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1607
01:56:52,857 --> 01:56:54,036
I think it's a warning.

1608
01:56:54,357 --> 01:56:56,036
It means danger is coming.

1609
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,008
Of course!

1610
01:57:05,033 --> 01:57:06,219
What is it?

1611
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,939
Don't you think it's a bit odd,

1612
01:57:08,116 --> 01:57:10,299
that what Hagrid wants more
than anything is a dragon...

1613
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:12,970
and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1614
01:57:13,178 --> 01:57:16,263
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1615
01:57:16,641 --> 01:57:18,310
Why didn't I see it before?

1616
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,778
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?

1617
01:57:26,802 --> 01:57:28,099
What did he look like?

1618
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:30,999
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1619
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,656
The stranger though.
You and he must have talked.

1620
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:35,119
Well he...

1621
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:37,899
he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1622
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:40,041
I told him. I said after Fluffy,

1623
01:57:40,393 --> 01:57:42,268
a dragon is gonna be no problem.

1624
01:57:42,408 --> 01:57:44,003
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

1625
01:57:44,721 --> 01:57:46,900
Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1626
01:57:47,182 --> 01:57:49,326
How often do you come across
a three headed dog,

1627
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,869
even if you are in the trade?

1628
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,137
But I told him. I said...

1629
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:55,223
I said the trick with any beast,

1630
01:57:55,247 --> 01:57:57,049
is to know how to calm him.

1631
01:57:57,385 --> 01:57:58,726
Take Fluffy, for example.

1632
01:57:59,228 --> 01:58:01,572
Just play him a bit of music
and he falls straight to sleep.

1633
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:05,932
I should not have told you that.

1634
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,026
Where are you going? Wait!

1635
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,488
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1636
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,347
I am afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1637
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:25,837
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic

1638
01:58:25,861 --> 01:58:27,424
and left immediately for London.

1639
01:58:27,449 --> 01:58:30,331
He is gone? Now?
But this is important!

1640
01:58:30,659 --> 01:58:32,600
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!

1641
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,700
How do you know?
Someone is going to try and steal it.

1642
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,906
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

1643
01:58:40,931 --> 01:58:43,094
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

1644
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,023
Now would you go back
to your dormitories?

1645
01:58:46,445 --> 01:58:47,500
Quietly.

1646
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:59,599
That was no stranger Hagrid
met in the village. It was Snape.

1647
01:58:59,646 --> 01:59:02,240
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1648
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,958
And with Dumbledore gone...

1649
01:59:03,982 --> 01:59:05,203
Good afternoon.

1650
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,911
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors

1651
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:13,551
such as yourselves be doing inside...

1652
01:59:13,879 --> 01:59:15,497
on a day like this?

1653
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:23,387
We were just...
You ought to be careful.

1654
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,567
People will think you are...

1655
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,035
up to something.

1656
01:59:44,364 --> 01:59:45,528
Now what do we do?

1657
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,752
We go down the trap door.

1658
01:59:48,668 --> 01:59:49,481
Tonight.

1659
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:04,919
Trevor.

1660
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,771
Trevor!

1661
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:08,356
Go! You should not be here!

1662
02:00:09,536 --> 02:00:10,732
Neither should you.

1663
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:14,466
You are sneaking out again, are not you?

1664
02:00:15,052 --> 02:00:16,197
Now Neville, listen.

1665
02:00:16,505 --> 02:00:17,615
We were...
No.

1666
02:00:17,943 --> 02:00:19,099
I won't let you!

1667
02:00:19,271 --> 02:00:21,077
You will get Gryffindor into trouble again.

1668
02:00:21,614 --> 02:00:23,899
I... will fight you.

1669
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:26,415
Neville, I am really
really sorry about this.

1670
02:00:26,736 --> 02:00:28,599
Petrificus Totalus.

1671
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,302
You are a little scary sometimes,

1672
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,918
you know that?

1673
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,263
Brilliant,

1674
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:43,159
but scary.

1675
02:00:44,823 --> 02:00:45,854
Let's go.

1676
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:47,728
Sorry.

1677
02:00:48,689 --> 02:00:50,362
It's for your own good, you know.

1678
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:58,030
You stood on my foot!

1679
02:00:58,522 --> 02:00:59,588
Sorry.

1680
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,917
Alohomora.

1681
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,639
Wait a minute. He is...

1682
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,371
snoring.

1683
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:28,477
Snape is already been here.

1684
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,449
He is put a spell on the harp.

1685
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,652
It's got horrible breath.

1686
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,232
We have to move its paw.
What?

1687
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:42,927
Come on!

1688
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,122
Ok.

1689
02:01:48,419 --> 02:01:49,417
Push.

1690
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:13,773
I will go first.

1691
02:02:14,078 --> 02:02:16,007
Don't follow until I give you a sign.

1692
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,110
If something bad happens,

1693
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:20,242
get yourselves out.

1694
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,657
Does it seem a bit...

1695
02:02:24,543 --> 02:02:26,000
quiet to you?

1696
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,512
The harp.

1697
02:02:29,103 --> 02:02:30,556
It's stopped playing.

1698
02:02:41,998 --> 02:02:42,943
Jump!

1699
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:59,304
Lucky this plant thing is here, really.

1700
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,961
Stop moving, both of you.

1701
02:03:16,985 --> 02:03:18,299
This is Devil's Snare.

1702
02:03:18,451 --> 02:03:19,713
You have to relax.

1703
02:03:19,857 --> 02:03:22,355
If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1704
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:23,759
Kill us faster?

1705
02:03:23,783 --> 02:03:25,903
Oh, now I can relax!

1706
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:30,637
Hermione!
Hermione!

1707
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,977
Now what are we gonna do?

1708
02:03:33,001 --> 02:03:34,482
Just relax!

1709
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,772
Hermione, where are you?

1710
02:03:37,357 --> 02:03:38,649
Do what I say!

1711
02:03:38,962 --> 02:03:40,052
Trust me.

1712
02:03:43,763 --> 02:03:44,677
Harry?

1713
02:03:45,162 --> 02:03:46,005
Harry?

1714
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,033
Are you ok?

1715
02:03:48,057 --> 02:03:49,485
Yeah, yeah I am fine.

1716
02:03:50,742 --> 02:03:52,413
He is not relaxing, is he?

1717
02:03:52,437 --> 02:03:53,799
Apparently not.

1718
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,656
We have got to do something.
What?

1719
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,884
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1720
02:04:00,439 --> 02:04:02,131
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.

1721
02:04:02,155 --> 02:04:03,517
It's deadly fun...

1722
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,594
but will sulk in the sun!
That's it!

1723
02:04:06,618 --> 02:04:08,664
Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1724
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,453
Lumus Solem.

1725
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:21,008
Ron you ok?
Yeah.

1726
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,883
Lucky we didn't panic.

1727
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:30,133
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1728
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,973
What is that?

1729
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:35,456
I don't know.

1730
02:04:36,754 --> 02:04:38,066
Sounds like wings.

1731
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,389
Curious.

1732
02:04:52,706 --> 02:04:54,784
I have never seen birds like these.

1733
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,435
They are not birds.

1734
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:58,089
They are keys.

1735
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,939
And I will bet one of them
fits that door.

1736
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,111
What's this all about?

1737
02:05:08,275 --> 02:05:09,397
I don't know.

1738
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,506
Strange.

1739
02:05:18,879 --> 02:05:20,233
Alohomora!

1740
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,020
Well, it was worth a try.

1741
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:27,800
What're we going to do?

1742
02:05:28,168 --> 02:05:29,875
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1743
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,804
We are looking for a big old fashioned one.

1744
02:05:32,199 --> 02:05:33,785
Probably rusty like the handle.

1745
02:05:34,214 --> 02:05:35,516
There! I see it!

1746
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:37,091
The one with the broken wing.

1747
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,395
What's wrong Harry?

1748
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,849
It's too simple.

1749
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,695
Oh go on Harry!

1750
02:05:48,019 --> 02:05:50,800
If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1751
02:05:51,126 --> 02:05:53,612
You are the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1752
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:13,371
This complicates things a bit.

1753
02:06:35,709 --> 02:06:37,162
Catch the key!

1754
02:06:42,025 --> 02:06:43,100
Hurry up!

1755
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,743
I don't like this.

1756
02:07:19,323 --> 02:07:21,010
I don't like this at all.

1757
02:07:21,292 --> 02:07:22,373
Where are we?

1758
02:07:23,143 --> 02:07:24,378
A graveyard.

1759
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,456
This is no graveyard.

1760
02:07:34,962 --> 02:07:36,384
It's a chessboard.

1761
02:07:49,956 --> 02:07:50,964
There is the door.

1762
02:08:04,222 --> 02:08:05,600
Now what do we do?

1763
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,875
It's obvious, isn't it?

1764
02:08:07,101 --> 02:08:08,988
We have got to play
our way across the room.

1765
02:08:10,457 --> 02:08:11,422
Alright.

1766
02:08:11,707 --> 02:08:14,183
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1767
02:08:14,644 --> 02:08:17,624
Hermione, you will be
the queenside castle.

1768
02:08:18,978 --> 02:08:20,139
As for me,

1769
02:08:20,889 --> 02:08:22,077
I will be a knight.

1770
02:08:30,232 --> 02:08:31,616
What happens now?

1771
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,030
Well, white moves first.

1772
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,101
And then...

1773
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,702
we play.

1774
02:08:51,406 --> 02:08:52,254
Ron,

1775
02:08:53,054 --> 02:08:55,562
you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1776
02:08:56,757 --> 02:08:58,999
real wizard's chess, do you?

1777
02:09:00,664 --> 02:09:02,398
You there, D5.

1778
02:09:18,023 --> 02:09:19,625
Yes, Hermione.

1779
02:09:20,047 --> 02:09:21,909
I think this is gonna be...

1780
02:09:22,136 --> 02:09:24,305
exactly like wizard's chess.

1781
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,172
Castle to E4!

1782
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,079
Pawn to C3!

1783
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,180
Wait a minute.

1784
02:10:26,265 --> 02:10:27,781
You understand right, Harry.

1785
02:10:28,468 --> 02:10:30,227
Once I make my move,

1786
02:10:31,054 --> 02:10:32,414
the queen will take me.

1787
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:36,000
Then you are free, to check the king.

1788
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:37,734
No. Ron, no!

1789
02:10:38,171 --> 02:10:39,100
What is it?

1790
02:10:39,593 --> 02:10:41,238
He is going to sacrifice himself.

1791
02:10:41,539 --> 02:10:44,223
No, you can't!
There must be another way!

1792
02:10:44,481 --> 02:10:47,254
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1793
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:50,914
Harry, it's you that has to go on.

1794
02:10:50,938 --> 02:10:52,035
I know it.

1795
02:10:52,528 --> 02:10:54,559
Not me. Not Hermione.

1796
02:10:54,717 --> 02:10:55,551
You.

1797
02:11:05,645 --> 02:11:07,574
Knight to H3.

1798
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:30,528
Check.

1799
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,522
Ron!

1800
02:12:02,508 --> 02:12:04,029
No, don't move!

1801
02:12:04,568 --> 02:12:05,690
Don't forget,

1802
02:12:05,956 --> 02:12:07,131
we are still playing.

1803
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,689
Checkmate.

1804
02:12:44,609 --> 02:12:45,779
Take care of Ron.

1805
02:12:46,054 --> 02:12:47,296
Then go to the owlery.

1806
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:48,990
Send a message to Dumbledore.

1807
02:12:49,593 --> 02:12:50,757
Ron is right.

1808
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,538
I have to go on.

1809
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,205
You will be ok, Harry.

1810
02:12:56,203 --> 02:12:57,416
You are a great wizard.

1811
02:12:57,749 --> 02:12:58,851
You really are.

1812
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,304
Not as good as you.

1813
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,005
Me?

1814
02:13:04,029 --> 02:13:05,549
Books and cleverness.

1815
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:07,967
There are more important things.

1816
02:13:09,333 --> 02:13:11,513
Friendship and bravery.

1817
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,545
And Harry, just be careful.

1818
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:53,991
You?

1819
02:13:55,546 --> 02:13:56,433
No,

1820
02:13:56,457 --> 02:13:57,517
it can't be.

1821
02:13:58,014 --> 02:13:59,186
Snape, he

1822
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,264
He was the...
Yes,

1823
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:02,249
he does seem the type, doesn't he?

1824
02:14:02,811 --> 02:14:04,920
Next to him, who would suspect...

1825
02:14:05,116 --> 02:14:06,735
Po-po-po-poor,

1826
02:14:06,759 --> 02:14:09,209
stu-stu-stuttering Professor Quirrell?

1827
02:14:09,756 --> 02:14:11,156
But, that day,

1828
02:14:11,741 --> 02:14:13,283
during the Quidditch match,

1829
02:14:14,123 --> 02:14:15,499
Snape tried to kill me.

1830
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,912
No, dear boy.

1831
02:14:17,124 --> 02:14:18,671
I tried to kill you!

1832
02:14:19,148 --> 02:14:20,248
And trust me,

1833
02:14:20,272 --> 02:14:23,375
if Snape's cloak had not caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1834
02:14:23,499 --> 02:14:25,399
I would have succeeded.

1835
02:14:25,943 --> 02:14:28,999
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1836
02:14:29,349 --> 02:14:31,521
Snape was trying to save me?

1837
02:14:31,607 --> 02:14:33,553
I knew you were a danger
to me right from the off.

1838
02:14:34,123 --> 02:14:35,699
Especially after Halloween.

1839
02:14:37,185 --> 02:14:38,975
Then you, then you let the troll in!

1840
02:14:39,264 --> 02:14:41,037
Very good Potter, yes.

1841
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,700
Snape, unfortunately, was not fooled.

1842
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:48,867
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1843
02:14:51,086 --> 02:14:52,322
He, of course,

1844
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:54,406
never trusted me again.

1845
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,035
He rarely left me alone.

1846
02:14:58,009 --> 02:14:59,665
But he doesn't understand.

1847
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,290
I am never alone.

1848
02:15:03,259 --> 02:15:04,228
Never.

1849
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,002
Now,

1850
02:15:06,529 --> 02:15:08,310
what does this mirror do?

1851
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,435
I see what I desire.

1852
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:15,387
I see myself holding the Stone.

1853
02:15:16,687 --> 02:15:18,099
But how do I get it?

1854
02:15:18,351 --> 02:15:20,148
Use the boy.

1855
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:22,811
Come here, Potter!

1856
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,609
Now!

1857
02:15:37,154 --> 02:15:38,118
Tell me,

1858
02:15:39,003 --> 02:15:40,058
what do you see?

1859
02:16:06,349 --> 02:16:07,799
What is it? What do you see?

1860
02:16:08,996 --> 02:16:10,856
I am shaking hands with Dumbledore.

1861
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:14,175
I have won the house cup.

1862
02:16:14,387 --> 02:16:16,100
He lies.

1863
02:16:16,481 --> 02:16:17,741
Tell the truth!

1864
02:16:18,199 --> 02:16:20,051
What do you see?

1865
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,495
Let me speak to him.

1866
02:16:22,519 --> 02:16:24,660
Master, you are not strong enough.

1867
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:28,129
I have strength enough for this.

1868
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,552
Harry Potter...

1869
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,185
we meet again.

1870
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,021
Voldemort.

1871
02:16:54,474 --> 02:16:55,654
Yes.

1872
02:16:55,958 --> 02:16:57,840
You see what I have become?

1873
02:16:58,715 --> 02:17:01,731
See what I must do to survive?

1874
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:04,371
Live off another.

1875
02:17:04,637 --> 02:17:06,595
A mere parasite.

1876
02:17:07,244 --> 02:17:10,470
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1877
02:17:10,806 --> 02:17:13,267
but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1878
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:17,580
But there is something that can.

1879
02:17:18,431 --> 02:17:21,011
Something that conveniently enough,

1880
02:17:21,485 --> 02:17:23,431
lies in your pocket.

1881
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:25,423
Stop him!

1882
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:32,669
Don't be a fool.

1883
02:17:33,990 --> 02:17:36,833
Why suffer an horrific death...

1884
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,698
when you can join me...

1885
02:17:40,039 --> 02:17:41,299
and live?

1886
02:17:41,593 --> 02:17:42,578
Never!

1887
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,465
Bravery.

1888
02:17:47,007 --> 02:17:48,600
Your parents had it too.

1889
02:17:50,186 --> 02:17:51,251
Tell me...

1890
02:17:51,842 --> 02:17:53,045
Harry...

1891
02:17:53,655 --> 02:17:56,788
would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1892
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:58,826
Together...

1893
02:18:00,029 --> 02:18:01,553
we can bring them back.

1894
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,347
All I ask...

1895
02:18:04,732 --> 02:18:06,600
is for something in return.

1896
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:16,997
That's it, Harry.

1897
02:18:18,636 --> 02:18:21,386
There is no good and evil.

1898
02:18:22,730 --> 02:18:25,050
There is only power...

1899
02:18:25,823 --> 02:18:29,077
and those too weak to seek it.

1900
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,958
Together,

1901
02:18:32,311 --> 02:18:35,647
we will do extraordinary things.

1902
02:18:36,056 --> 02:18:38,556
Just give me the Stone!

1903
02:18:41,115 --> 02:18:42,192
You liar!

1904
02:18:42,388 --> 02:18:43,725
Kill him!

1905
02:19:08,085 --> 02:19:09,621
What is this magic?

1906
02:19:09,645 --> 02:19:12,117
Fool, get the Stone!

1907
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:59,994
Good afternoon, Harry.

1908
02:21:03,150 --> 02:21:04,027
Tokens...

1909
02:21:04,923 --> 02:21:06,195
from your admirers?

1910
02:21:06,219 --> 02:21:07,329
Admirers?

1911
02:21:07,837 --> 02:21:10,408
What happened down
in the dungeons between you

1912
02:21:10,595 --> 02:21:13,211
and Professor Quirrell
is a complete secret.

1913
02:21:14,102 --> 02:21:14,787
So,

1914
02:21:15,164 --> 02:21:16,122
naturally,

1915
02:21:16,466 --> 02:21:17,954
the whole school knows.

1916
02:21:22,055 --> 02:21:24,380
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the...

1917
02:21:24,609 --> 02:21:26,382
trouble of opening your...

1918
02:21:26,734 --> 02:21:27,819
Chocolate Frogs.

1919
02:21:28,046 --> 02:21:29,260
Ron was here?

1920
02:21:29,284 --> 02:21:30,261
Is he alright?

1921
02:21:30,363 --> 02:21:31,292
What about Hermione?

1922
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:32,277
Fine.

1923
02:21:33,386 --> 02:21:35,050
They are both just fine.

1924
02:21:36,713 --> 02:21:38,112
What happened to the Stone?

1925
02:21:38,137 --> 02:21:39,409
Relax dear boy.

1926
02:21:39,901 --> 02:21:41,706
The Stone has been destroyed.

1927
02:21:43,252 --> 02:21:45,486
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1928
02:21:46,109 --> 02:21:47,028
and agreed...

1929
02:21:47,384 --> 02:21:48,446
it was best...

1930
02:21:49,244 --> 02:21:50,166
all around.

1931
02:21:51,624 --> 02:21:52,742
But then Flamel,

1932
02:21:52,993 --> 02:21:54,460
he will die, won't he?

1933
02:21:57,538 --> 02:21:58,873
He has enough...

1934
02:21:59,155 --> 02:22:01,976
Elixir to set his affairs in order.

1935
02:22:03,203 --> 02:22:04,212
But yes,

1936
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:06,054
he will die.

1937
02:22:06,742 --> 02:22:08,726
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1938
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,703
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

1939
02:22:12,009 --> 02:22:12,887
You see,

1940
02:22:13,603 --> 02:22:15,071
only a person...

1941
02:22:16,392 --> 02:22:18,267
who wanted to find the Stone,

1942
02:22:18,993 --> 02:22:19,876
find it...

1943
02:22:20,626 --> 02:22:21,813
but not use it,

1944
02:22:22,207 --> 02:22:23,926
would be able to get it.

1945
02:22:26,106 --> 02:22:29,152
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1946
02:22:30,035 --> 02:22:31,197
And between you and me,

1947
02:22:31,449 --> 02:22:33,753
that is saying something.

1948
02:22:36,222 --> 02:22:37,286
Does that mean,

1949
02:22:37,753 --> 02:22:39,163
with the Stone gone that is,

1950
02:22:39,503 --> 02:22:41,120
that Voldemort can never come back?

1951
02:22:41,756 --> 02:22:43,354
I am afraid...

1952
02:22:45,471 --> 02:22:47,871
there are ways in which he can return.

1953
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:51,009
Harry,

1954
02:22:51,315 --> 02:22:52,823
do you know why...

1955
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:55,846
Professor Quirrell could not bear
to have you touch him?

1956
02:22:57,237 --> 02:22:58,599
It was because of your mother.

1957
02:22:59,573 --> 02:23:01,860
She sacrificed herself for you.

1958
02:23:02,423 --> 02:23:04,884
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1959
02:23:05,743 --> 02:23:06,524
No,

1960
02:23:07,009 --> 02:23:09,009
this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1961
02:23:09,931 --> 02:23:12,155
It lives, in your very skin.

1962
02:23:13,212 --> 02:23:14,103
What is it?

1963
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:16,701
Love, Harry.

1964
02:23:18,126 --> 02:23:19,032
Love.

1965
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:30,634
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1966
02:23:31,756 --> 02:23:35,459
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit flavored one.

1967
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:39,435
And since then, I am afraid,
I have lost my liking for them.

1968
02:23:40,139 --> 02:23:41,100
But I think...

1969
02:23:41,928 --> 02:23:43,170
I could be safe...

1970
02:23:43,709 --> 02:23:45,107
with a nice toffee.

1971
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:50,983
Alas!

1972
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:53,295
Earwax.

1973
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,797
Alright there, Ron?

1974
02:24:11,288 --> 02:24:12,991
Alright. You?

1975
02:24:14,149 --> 02:24:15,051
Alright.

1976
02:24:15,803 --> 02:24:16,819
Hermione?

1977
02:24:17,538 --> 02:24:18,725
Never better.

1978
02:24:35,153 --> 02:24:37,169
Another year gone.

1979
02:24:38,333 --> 02:24:40,076
And now as I understand it,

1980
02:24:40,341 --> 02:24:42,497
the house cup needs awarding.

1981
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,107
And the points stand thus.

1982
02:24:45,995 --> 02:24:47,125
In fourth place,

1983
02:24:47,662 --> 02:24:50,373
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1984
02:24:53,797 --> 02:24:54,841
Third place,

1985
02:24:55,625 --> 02:24:56,592
Hufflepuff...

1986
02:24:57,406 --> 02:24:59,328
with 352 points.

1987
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,027
In second place...

1988
02:25:06,598 --> 02:25:07,812
Ravenclaw,

1989
02:25:08,394 --> 02:25:11,277
with 426 points.

1990
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,999
And in first place...

1991
02:25:19,229 --> 02:25:21,534
with 472 points,

1992
02:25:22,135 --> 02:25:23,635
Slytherin house.

1993
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,210
Nice one, mate.

1994
02:25:36,193 --> 02:25:38,451
Yes, yes, well done Slytherin.

1995
02:25:38,476 --> 02:25:40,123
Well done Slytherin, however...

1996
02:25:40,638 --> 02:25:44,107
recent events,
must be taken into account.

1997
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:46,225
And I have a few...

1998
02:25:46,755 --> 02:25:48,794
last minute points to award.

1999
02:25:50,661 --> 02:25:51,647
To Miss...

2000
02:25:51,849 --> 02:25:53,065
Hermione Granger,

2001
02:25:53,802 --> 02:25:55,528
for the cool use of intellect...

2002
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,669
while others were in grave peril...

2003
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:00,950
50 points.

2004
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,302
Good job.

2005
02:26:12,025 --> 02:26:12,960
Second,

2006
02:26:13,638 --> 02:26:15,296
to Mr. Ronald Weasley,

2007
02:26:16,146 --> 02:26:18,325
for the best played game of chess...

2008
02:26:18,648 --> 02:26:19,634
that Hogwarts...

2009
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:21,969
has seen these many years,

2010
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:24,052
50 points.

2011
02:26:28,503 --> 02:26:29,635
And third...

2012
02:26:31,081 --> 02:26:33,315
to Mr. Harry Potter...

2013
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:35,650
for pure nerve

2014
02:26:35,674 --> 02:26:38,463
and outstanding courage...

2015
02:26:39,032 --> 02:26:41,322
I award Gryffindor house...

2016
02:26:42,627 --> 02:26:43,908
60 points.

2017
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:53,797
We are tied with Slytherin!

2018
02:26:54,368 --> 02:26:55,461
And finally,

2019
02:26:56,024 --> 02:26:59,852
it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

2020
02:27:00,594 --> 02:27:03,275
but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

2021
02:27:04,667 --> 02:27:05,680
I award...

2022
02:27:05,917 --> 02:27:07,120
10 points...

2023
02:27:07,879 --> 02:27:09,972
to Neville Longbottom.

2024
02:27:24,395 --> 02:27:27,692
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

2025
02:27:28,025 --> 02:27:30,098
that a change of decoration...

2026
02:27:30,207 --> 02:27:31,309
is in order.

2027
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:39,463
Gryffindor wins...

2028
02:27:39,963 --> 02:27:41,199
the house cup.

2029
02:27:43,074 --> 02:27:43,816
Yes!

2030
02:28:19,007 --> 02:28:21,289
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you will be late.

2031
02:28:22,515 --> 02:28:24,132
Train is leaving. Go on. Go on.

2032
02:28:24,468 --> 02:28:25,640
Come on, hurry up.

2033
02:28:32,193 --> 02:28:33,225
Come on, Harry.

2034
02:28:33,585 --> 02:28:34,586
One minute.

2035
02:28:41,914 --> 02:28:44,289
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

2036
02:28:48,801 --> 02:28:50,039
This is for you.

2037
02:29:07,252 --> 02:29:08,491
Thanks, Hagrid.

2038
02:29:15,375 --> 02:29:17,144
Go on. On with you. On with you now.

2039
02:29:17,429 --> 02:29:18,234
On with you.

2040
02:29:18,413 --> 02:29:19,663
Oh, listen Harry.

2041
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:21,982
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,

2042
02:29:22,006 --> 02:29:24,054
Dudley, gives you any grief...

2043
02:29:24,851 --> 02:29:26,195
you could always...

2044
02:29:26,765 --> 02:29:27,699
threaten him...

2045
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:29,615
with a nice pair of ears to go with that,

2046
02:29:29,639 --> 02:29:30,699
tail of his.

2047
02:29:30,934 --> 02:29:32,118
But Hagrid,

2048
02:29:32,325 --> 02:29:34,662
we are not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts.

2049
02:29:34,996 --> 02:29:36,100
You know that.

2050
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:37,289
I do.

2051
02:29:38,094 --> 02:29:39,747
But your cousin don't, do he?

2052
02:29:46,209 --> 02:29:47,800
Feels strange to be going home,

2053
02:29:48,084 --> 02:29:49,107
doesn't it?

2054
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:50,740
I am not going home.

2055
02:29:51,864 --> 02:29:52,959
Not really.

2056
02:30:35,857 --> 02:30:40,271
