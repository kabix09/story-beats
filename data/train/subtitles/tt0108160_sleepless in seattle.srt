1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,669
Mummy got sick.
And it happened just like that.

2
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,048
There's nothing anybody could do.

3
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,010
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:58,891
And if we start asking why, we'll go crazy.

5
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,249
Five minutes in the microwave.

6
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,169
Any one of them. Five
minutes, and ready to eat.

7
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,714
Do you know how to make juice?

8
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,345
Microwave. Five minutes.

9
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,284
Here. It's my shrink. Call him.

10
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,296
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,383
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,136
Parents without Partners.
Partners without Parents.

13
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,682
"Hug Yourself," "Hug a
Friend," "Hug a Shrink." Or work.

14
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,772
Work hard, work will save you. Work is the
only thing that will see you through this.

15
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,279
Don't mind him, he's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,374
What I think we really need is change.

17
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,503
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks
off, get some sun, take Jonah fishing.

18
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:58,177
No, real change. A new city.

19
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,099
Some place where every time I go
around a corner I don't think of Maggie.

20
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,025
Where are you gonna go?

21
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,616
I was thinking about Seattle.

22
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:26,455
Eventually, in a few months, you'll
start seeing women. You'll meet someone.

23
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,750
Right, right. Move on, right,
that's what I'm gonna do.

24
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,421
And then in a few months, boom,
I'll be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,441
Sam, I'm sorry...
She didn't mean that.

26
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,844
I know, I know. Look, it
just doesn't happen twice.

The tall one with red
hair is your cousin Irene.

48
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,613
You'll recognise her by the
disappointed look on her face.

49
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,545
Married to Harold, who
ran off with the secretary.

50
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:41,549
Who came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

51
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:46,554
Your brother Dennis is
professor at Johns Hopkins.

52
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,181
He's married to, uh, Betsy.

53
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,351
The most competitive woman in the world.

54
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,279
I don't see how I'm
gonna remember all this.

55
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,023
Oh, well, Walter, you will!

56
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,495
Your Uncle Milton lost all of his money.

57
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,622
And some other people's.

58
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,210
In a pyramid scheme. Don't mention
the IRS or the federal prisons system.

59
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
Your mother's Barbara, your father's Cliff.

60
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,968
My father has electric trains.
Really?

61
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,055
Am I what they had in mind?

62
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,476
Oh, Walter, they're gonna love you!

63
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,231
Everybody,
Annie has an announcement.

64
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,695
Oh... Walter and I are engaged.

65
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,037
Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,456
Mum knew. Dad, Mum knew.

67
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,333
I don't see a ring, Annie.

68
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,377
Congratulations, Walter.

69
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,007
Bless you. Bless you!

70
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,137
Are you all right?
It's nothing. It's nothing.

71
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,680
Maybe it's the flowers.

72
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,890
We'll move them.

73
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,520
No, don't touch them! I feel
terrible, sneezing at a time like this.

74
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,396
This is a very important moment for me.

75
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,564
He's allergic to everything,
don't worry about him.

76
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,360
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

77
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,321
Harold is allergic to every type of bee.

78
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,033
We always have to carry a
hypodermic of adrenalin wherever we go.

79
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,619
If he eats even one tiny piece of a nut...

80
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,665
My head swells up like a
watermelon and I drop dead.

81
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,667
It's the same with him and bees.

82
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,044
Your mother and I had
salmon at our wedding.

83
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,880
I really think a wedding
without cold salmon is...

84
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,134
I'm not allergic to salmon.
Oh, he's not allergic...

85
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,678
I don't think.
But you never know.

86
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,348
You never know.
Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

87
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,724
Oh, honey, what a shame.

88
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,060
We had some champagne.
What did we use it for?

89
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,687
Uncle Milton's parole.

90
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,439
And it was delicious.
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

91
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:07,319
When are you getting married?
In early June, in the garden.

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,780
Oh...

93
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,867
What about Harold and bees?
I'm allergic to bees.

94
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,743
We'll spray you.

95
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,914
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

96
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:24,253
I'm afraid I am allergic to strawberries.

97
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,715
Is this all right with you?

98
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:34,555
Today, I'm consider myself the luckiest
man-man-man on the face of the earth-earth-earth.

99
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,599
The Lou Gehrig line from...

100
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,101
Remember, Dad, the
Lou Gehrig line from, uh...

101
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,913
Pride of the Yankees.
Pride of the Yankees.

102
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,229
Pride of the Yankees!
Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,691
Baseball. It's baseball.
Historical reference.

104
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,776
I would like to propose a toast.

105
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
Hear, hear. To my kid sister.

106
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,616
To Walter and my baby.

107
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,951
To Walter and Annie.

108
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,957
Everyone, please eat before it gets cold.

109
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,672
Here it is. The Historical
Society wanted this

110
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,507
and I never would give it to them.

111
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,718
Oh, Mum...

112
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,429
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

113
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,473
Grandmother's dress.

114
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,102
Oh, honey.
He's a lovely man, Annie.

115
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,898
I know he is wonderful, isn't he?

116
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,817
And he's such a wonderful athlete.
Are his folks nice?

117
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,152
You'll love them.

118
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
We're going down to DC tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

119
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,034
How did it happen?
It's silly, really.

120
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,204
I mean, I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously I'd seen him.

121
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,373
He's the associate publisher.

122
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,876
And then one day we both ordered
sandwiches from the same place

123
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,547
and he got my lettuce and tomato on whole
wheat, which, of course, he was allergic to.

124
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,716
And I got his lettuce and tomato on white.

125
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,177
How amazing. It is, isn't it?

126
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,346
You make a million
decisions that mean nothing

127
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,349
and then one day you order
takeout that changes your life.

128
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,559
Destiny takes a hand.

129
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,187
Mum, destiny is something we've invented

130
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,983
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

131
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,569
Then how do you explain that you
both ordered exactly the same sandwich

132
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,446
except for the bread?

133
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,031
How many people in this world

134
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,536
like lettuce and tomato without
something else, like tuna?

135
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:25,666
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

136
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,795
I was in Atlantic City with
my family, Cliff was a waiter.

137
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,758
He wasn't even supposed to
work that night. Suppose he hadn't?

138
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,554
He asked me to take a
midnight walk on the Steel Pier.

139
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,766
I probably told you this a
million times, but I don't care.

140
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,519
Then he held my hand.

141
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:51,150
At one point I looked down and I couldn't tell
which fingers were his and which were mine.

142
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,154
And I knew. What?

143
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,406
You know.

144
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,661
What? Magic. It was magic.

145
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,164
Magic.

146
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,668
I knew we'd be together forever.
And that everything would be wonderful.

147
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,463
Just the way you feel about Walter.

148
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,009
Walter. It's quite a formal name.

149
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,305
One of the things I truly
knew was that your father and I

150
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,932
were going to have a wonderful time in

151
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,518
the sack, I believe you call it.

152
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,728
Mum.

153
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,816
Of course it took several
years before everything

154
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,857
worked like clockwork in that department.

155
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,068
So don't be worried if it takes a while.

156
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:39,365
We already...
Fine, fine. Fiddly-dee. How's it working?

157
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,411
Like clockwork. Oh, honey...

158
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,001
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.

159
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,761
They loved you. I told you they
would love you, and they loved you.

160
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,306
I love you. I love you, Walter.

161
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,311
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

162
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,646
No.

163
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,152
Not even when you were young?
No, not even when I was young.

164
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,947
You sure you don't want to drive with me?

165
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,825
Oh, how will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

166
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,162
I forgot the present. Walter, I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

167
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,914
I swear, when we're old and grey

168
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,962
you gonna have to remind
me to put my teeth in.

169
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,295
I'll be walking all over town smacking
my gums together, not even noticing.

170
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,382
I'll wait.
You'll wait? Oh, right.

171
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,550
No, don't wait, Walter. Really, it's
silly, you go ahead. We're late anyway.

172
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,554
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

Welcome back to
"You and Your Emotions."

185
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,757
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live across America

186
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,093
from the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.

187
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:27,264
Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.

188
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,057
What's your wish this Christmas Eve?

189
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,937
What's your wish?
My wish is to turn the radio station.

190
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,733
Subject of this evening's medical
update is: "You and your spleen."

191
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,359
And your host is...
Not on your life.

192
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:44,281
Coming up, "Jingle Bells"
backwards, sung by the New Jersey...

193
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,409
- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah...

194
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,870
No last names, Jonah.

195
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,499
You sound younger than our
usual callers. How old are you?

196
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,708
I'm 8.

197
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,710
Eight? How come you're up so late?

198
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,295
It's not that late in Seattle.

199
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,130
Oh, of course,
you're absolutely right.

200
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,591
All right, what's your
Christmas wish, Jonah?

201
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,178
It's not for me, it's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.

202
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,430
You don't like the one he has now?

203
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,891
- He doesn't have one now.
- That's the problem.

204
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,601
Where's your mum?

205
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,102
She died.

206
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,440
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, who can believe this?

207
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,401
I've been pretty sad,
but I think my Dad's worse.

208
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,404
Have you talked to your dad about it?

209
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,323
- No.
- Why not?

210
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,408
It's like it makes him sadder.

211
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,079
- Aw, I can understand that.
- Jonah, is your dad home right now?

212
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,498
Yeah.
What's he doing? Is he busy?

213
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,708
Not really, he's out on the deck.

214
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,046
- I'm sure that I can help.
- But I'm gonna need you to help me...

215
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:46,927
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
- No way, he'd kill me.

216
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,136
Trust me, Jonah.

217
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,099
He won't be angry when he realises
how concerned you are about him.

218
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,308
Wanna bet?

219
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,103
But if I get yelled at, I'm never
gonna listen to your show again.

220
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay, fair enough.

221
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,109
- Dad?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,362
There's someone
on the phone for you.

223
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,909
- His name is Sam.
- Sam.

224
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,495
If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone

225
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,206
and tonight's topic is
your wishes and dreams.

226
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,416
I got it.

227
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,311
We're on the line now
with someone from Seattle.

228
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,377
Hello.

229
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,298
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

230
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,720
Okay. What are you selling tonight?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

231
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,015
- No, I'm not selling anything.
- I just wanna help.

232
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,100
I want you to know that your son called

233
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,687
and he asked me for some advice
on how you might find a new wife.

234
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,188
Who is this?

235
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:46,153
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network
America. And you are on the air.

236
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,490
- You called a radio station?
- Sam, are you with me?

237
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
Yeah. Yes.

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,663
Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.

239
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,334
And he is genuinely worried about you.

240
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,088
Get out here. Get out here. Come on,
now, I'm not gonna go through this alone.

241
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,426
I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.

242
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,348
I thought maybe you and I could talk, it
would make Jonah feel a little better. Sam?

243
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,018
Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.
Of what?

244
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,770
Her first name could be Doctor.

245
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:26,610
Please.
Sam. Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

246
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,821
Okay. Okay. Good.

247
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,243
- Now, I know this is difficult.
- But how long ago did your wife die?

248
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:41,833
About a year and a half ago.
Aw. Have you had any relationships?

249
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,047
No. No? Why not?

250
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,886
Uh, Marcia, or Dr. Fieldstone?
Dr. Marcia.

251
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:57,057
- Dr. Marcia.
- I don't mean to be rude...

252
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,226
And I don't want to invade
your privacy...

253
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,977
- Sure you do.
- Sure you do.

254
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:06,149
Go on, Sam. I'm listening. Sam.

255
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,197
We had a pretty tough time at first.

256
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,075
But we're dealing with it.

257
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:22,082
And Jonah and I will get along just
fine again, as soon as I break his radio.

258
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,754
I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.

259
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,382
You know, you can tell a lot
from a person's voice.

260
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,842
You certainly can.

261
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,263
But something must be missing if Jonah
still feels that you're under a cloud.

262
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,015
Just a few questions:
Are you sleeping at night?

263
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,810
He doesn't sleep at all.

264
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,730
How do you know that?
I live here, Dad.

265
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,778
Look, it's Christmas.

266
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,327
Maggie, my wife.

267
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,497
She really did it...

268
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:07,335
I mean, she loved...
She made everything beautiful.

269
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,300
It's just tough this time of year.

270
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,051
Every kid needs a mother.

271
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,724
Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?

272
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,353
- Yes.
- Don't answer that.

273
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,522
Let's get into that right
after these messages.

274
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,941
Sam, Jonah, don't go away.

275
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,362
If you've have just tuned in,
we are talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

276
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,533
And we'll be right back after this
break with your listener response.

277
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,494
What is she talking about?

278
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,301
This is when other people get to
call in and dump on what you said.

279
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:49,211
Oh. Oh. Well, this is
really fun. And helpful.

280
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,302
I bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

281
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,846
I bet he hasn't bathed
in weeks and he stinks.

282
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,100
Harriet, shut up. Hi, can I help you?
Tea, with the bag out.

283
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,313
You know, maybe I'll just go up to Seattle,
give him a little gift for New Year's Eve.

284
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,608
Yeah, you go on out there if you
want to. But don't open his refrigerator.

285
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,236
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge

286
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,197
they just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

287
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,159
All I'm saying is I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

288
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,846
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty five cents.

289
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,872
Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.

290
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,584
Ooh!
Tennessee, you are on the air.

291
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,422
Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.

292
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,466
Honey, get in line.

293
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,468
Next caller, go ahead.

294
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,640
If there was one question
I was allowed to ask...

295
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,933
Oh, go ahead.

296
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,229
People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.

297
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:54,025
Sam, do you think that there is someone out
there you could love as much as your wife?

298
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,157
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.

299
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,452
What are you going to do?

300
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,874
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning

301
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,835
and breathe in and out all day long.

302
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,965
And after a while I won't
have to remind myself

303
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,969
to get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out.

304
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,181
And then after a while I won't
have to think about

305
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:30,228
how I had it great and perfect for a while.

306
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,691
Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife.

307
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,360
Well, how long is your program me?

308
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,243
Oh, well, it was a
million tiny, little things.

309
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:50,081
When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.

310
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,628
And I knew it, I knew it
the very first time I touched her.

311
00:20:55,212 --> 00:21:00,717
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

312
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,179
I was just taking her hand

313
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,975
to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

314
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,814
It was like magic. Magic.

315
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, folks, it's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone in Chicago.

316
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,825
And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.

317
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,371
And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,

318
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,249
we hope you'll call again soon
and let us know how it's going.

319
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,918
Oh, you can count on it.

This man sells the greatest soup you've ever
eaten, and he is the meanest man in America.

326
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,268
I feel very strongly about this,
Becky. It's not just about soup.

327
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,686
Do it. What else?

328
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,105
New Year's Eve. Please
don't make me write it.

329
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,235
Listen to this: "Phone service in the Chicago
area was tied up for two hours Christmas Eve

330
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,031
when some kid calls a radio show
and says that his dad needs a new wife."

331
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,909
Two thousand women called the
station asking for the guy's number.

332
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,705
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife."

333
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,250
And the shrink practically forces the guy
and says, "Do you want to talk about it."

334
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,544
And he says,
"No, as a matter of fact, I don't."

335
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,547
And then suddenly for no
reason at all he start to talk

336
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,995
about how much he loved his wife

337
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,302
and how he just fell in love with her like
he was one of those cows in Michigan.

338
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,429
What cows in Michigan?

339
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,807
It was on 60 Minutes over those
cows that got zapped by stray voltage.

340
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,101
No one knows why.
And maybe it was Wisconsin.

341
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,814
But, anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife

342
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,733
and suddenly I was crying.

343
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,469
It's like what happens when I
watch those phone company ads.

344
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,488
I don't have to see the
whole thing, just the part

345
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,824
where the daughter gives the mother
the refrigerator with the big red bow.

346
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:34,079
Yes. The Polaroid commercial, two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.

347
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,083
They're making the album.
That kills me!

348
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,438
You should write something about this.

349
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,630
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

350
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,425
I tell you what it is: Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband?

351
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,738
There are a lot of desperate
women out there looking for love.

352
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,638
Especially over a certain age.

353
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,086
You know it's easier to be killed by a
terrorist than it is to get married over 40.

354
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,143
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

355
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,063
That's right, it's not true.
But it feels true.

356
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,511
It feels true because it's true.

357
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,252
There is practically a whole book
about how that statistic is not true.

358
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,028
Calm down, you brought it up.
I did not, Wyatt.

359
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,321
Did you even read that book?

360
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,300
Did anybody read that
book all the way through?

361
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,535
Are you two finished?
Fine, now where were we?

362
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:18,039
If someone's a widower, why do
they say that he was he "widowed"?

363
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,625
Why don't they say he was "widowered"?

364
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,213
I was just wondering.

365
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,173
What was that about up there?

366
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,009
What was what? What's with you?

367
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,262
Nothing's with me.

368
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,888
Something's with you.

369
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,684
What are you saying?
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

370
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,227
Sleepless in Seattle?

371
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,980
That's what she called him on
the show because he can't sleep.

372
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,442
And now 2000 women want his
number. The guy could be a crackhead,

373
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,780
a transvestite, a flasher, a junkie,
a chainsaw murderer

374
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,200
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

375
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,121
Actually, he sounded nice.

376
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,749
Oh? Oh, really?

377
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,335
Now we're getting down to it.

378
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,132
Please, Becky. I'm madly in love with Walter.
He did the craziest thing the other night.

379
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,675
What was that?

380
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:16,014
Oh, it was so funny. We
were hysterical. What was that?

381
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:33,239
You know, I was thinking, I've gotta go
to Boston for the AAB convention, right?

382
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,785
And then I gotta visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers, but...

383
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,207
Why don't we meet in New
York for Valentine's Day weekend.

384
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,667
Walter, I'd love to!

385
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,129
We can stay at the Plaza.

386
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,506
Ice skate in Central Park.

387
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,719
Register.

388
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:59,182
Yeah, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

389
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,395
How about it?

390
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,525
I'll take you to Chinatown for dim sum.

391
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,069
Does it have wheat in it?

392
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,363
I don't think so.

What did I used to say?

422
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,383
"Here's looking at you"?

423
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,510
"Here's mud in your eye."

424
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,762
"Here's to us."

425
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,142
You used to say, "Here's to us."

426
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,397
Oh, babe.

427
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,358
I miss you so much it hurts.

428
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
What do you wanna do?
Tell him when he gets here.

429
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,589
You want to tell him?
You can tell him?

430
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,340
She's back.
She has another idea.

431
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,708
No, no, no. I don't need this.

432
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,844
Sam, I'm so glad you're here.
How are you?

433
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,556
I heard you on the radio.
I told everyone about it.

434
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,600
We already knew. How did you...?

435
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,226
Grace. The dispatcher?

436
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,728
Yeah. All of Seattle knows.

437
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,481
I was brushing my teeth
and, suddenly, there you were.

438
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,442
I just couldn't believe my ears. I
called my mother in Las Vegas.

439
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:24,363
I said, "Mother, turn on the
radio. That's my architect."

440
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:30,620
You know, it's so nice when a
man can express his feelings.

441
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,164
It's wonderful.
I wish I could express my feelings.

442
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,208
So, Claire, is there a problem?

443
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,253
I was tossing and turning last
night. You know what that's like, Sam.

444
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,423
Because I realise I'm
never going to fit my platters

445
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,383
in that refrigerator we ordered.

446
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,511
And when I give parties,
I always put in platters.

447
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,263
So I thought I would get the
sub-zero refrigerator instead.

448
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,433
And the only problem...
We have to redo all the cabinets.

449
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,311
We're gonna...
We'll be into this wall.

450
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,147
- That's bearing wall.
- That's a delay, Claire, of...

451
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,441
Two, three... Five, six...

452
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,109
Twelve weeks. I don't mind.

453
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
The important thing is to get it right.

454
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,489
Absolutely. Your words.

455
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,408
Oh, I've gotta rush.
La décorateur calls.

456
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,994
Bye. Bye.

457
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,876
Well, this is fate. She's divorced,
we don't wanna redo the cabinets,

458
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,964
and you need a wife. What do they
call that, when everything intersects?

459
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,882
The Bermuda Triangle.

460
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:38,271
And here's another one. Do
you got room for one more here?

461
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,147
Here you go. Right there.

462
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,108
Look at this, Dad.
They're all for you.

463
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,776
Yes, sir. Here you go.

464
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,991
"Sleepless in Seattle,"
c/o Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

465
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,285
If you're having trouble
sleeping, you might wanna try

466
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,954
drinking a glass of
water from the other side.

467
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,498
I thought that was for hiccups.
Does it work for hiccups?

468
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,210
For hiccups, take a spoonful of
sugar, hold it in your mouth for a minute.

469
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,004
Really?

470
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,423
Thank you.

471
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,758
What possessed you
to give them our address?

472
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,177
They called and asked for it.

473
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,972
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle

474
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,684
"you're the most attractive man
I ever lay ears on." Pfft.

475
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,312
Wait, wait. They called?

476
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,732
How did they get our number? Oh,
let me guess. You gave it to them.

477
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,152
You have to give them your
number or they won't let you on the air.

478
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,031
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. I
live in Tulsa." Where's that?

479
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,408
It's in Oklahoma.

480
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,411
You know where Oklahoma is?
Somewhere in the middle.

481
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,832
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

482
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,020
Yeah, somewhere in the middle.
And, generally speaking

483
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:46,464
we should rule out anyone
that doesn't live near here.

484
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,341
She's willing to fly anywhere.

485
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,638
She looks like my third-grade
teacher. I hated my third-grade teacher.

486
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,767
Wait a minute.
She is my third-grade teacher!

487
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,313
Aren't you gonna read any of these?
No. This is not how it's done.

488
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,817
I'd much rather just see somebody I like

489
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,405
and get a feeling about them,
ask them if they wanna have a drink.

490
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,366
Or a slice of pizza? Not dinner.

491
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,953
Not on the first date, because halfway
through dinner, you could be really sorry.

492
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,955
Whereas, if it's just a drink

493
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,875
if you like them, you can
always ask them to dinner.

494
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,921
If not, you can say, "Well, that
was great," and then you go home.

495
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,923
You see what I mean?

496
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,510
I wonder if it still works this way.

497
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,889
It doesn't. They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.

498
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,560
If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?

499
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,729
I certainly hope so.

500
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,232
Will she scratch up your back?

501
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,359
What?

502
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:53,239
In movies, women always scratch
up the man's back and screaming.

503
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,492
How do you know this?
Jed's got cable.

504
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,411
Oh, Jed's got...

505
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,082
Hand me that towel behind you.

506
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,630
Thank you. I need it too.

507
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,465
Here, let me get you.

508
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,718
"Jed's got cable!" Come on.

Welcome back
to the best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone

523
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,977
clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.

524
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,938
Remember Marooned in Miami?

525
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,148
He says he doesn't love me anymore.

526
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,360
Why would you wanna be with
someone who doesn't love you?

527
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,153
Disappointed in Denver.

528
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:00,324
Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.

529
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,618
Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand.

530
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,537
Sleepless in Seattle.

531
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,250
Well, I'm going to get out
of bed every morning.

532
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,295
Breathe in and out all day long.

533
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,342
And then after a while,
I won't have to remind myself

534
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,347
to get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out.

535
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:29,520
And then after a while,
I won't have to think about

536
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,774
how I had it great and perfect for a while.

537
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,195
Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?

538
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,991
Well, how long is your program me?

539
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,288
Oh, well, it was...

540
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,456
Oh, it was a million tiny, little things.

541
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,667
When you added them all up

542
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,420
it just meant that we were
supposed to be together.

543
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,963
And I knew it.

544
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,049
I knew it the first time I touched her.

545
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,677
It was like coming home,

546
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,722
only to no home I'd ever known.

547
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,474
I was just taking her hand,

548
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,769
to help her out of a car.

549
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,981
And I knew it.

550
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,108
It was like

551
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,694
magic.

552
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,136
Well, I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
I really do. Are you happily married?

553
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,180
What? I mean...

554
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:49,850
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

555
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,855
I got married because Betsy said we had to
break up or get married. So we got married.

556
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,942
But when you first met her, did you believe

557
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,987
that she was the only person for
you, that in some mystical, cosmic way

558
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,366
it was fated? Annie,

559
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,702
when you're attracted to someone,
it means your subconscious

560
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,830
is attracted to their subconscious,
subconsciously.

561
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,834
What we think of as fate is just two
neuroses knowing they're a perfect match.

562
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,046
I don't even know him.

563
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,926
I'm having all of these fantasies
about some man I've never even met,

564
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,178
who lives in Seattle!

565
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,347
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

566
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,182
I know. I know.

567
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,394
I do not wanna move to Seattle.

568
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,023
But what I really don't wanna do

569
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,859
is end up always wondering
what might've happened

570
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,154
and knowing I could've done
something. What do you think?

571
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,410
It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everybody
panics before they get married.

572
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,246
I mean, didn't you? Yes, I did.

573
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,164
Yes, you did. Thank
you very much, Dennis.

574
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,834
I feel so much better
just having blown this off.

575
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,127
Anytime.

576
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,672
Sandy has a girlfriend,
Glenda. She's a weightlifter.

577
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,885
Her neck isn't bigger than her head...
No, I'm not asking you to set me up.

578
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:11,223
I don't need your help with that. I
wanna know what it's like out there.

579
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:16,478
That's what I'm trying to tell you what
women are looking for: Pecs and a cute butt.

580
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,106
Like, "He has the cutest butt."
Yeah.

581
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,067
Where did I hear that recently?
Everywhere.

582
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,779
You can't even turn on the news
without hearing some babe

583
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,823
thought some guy's butt was cute.

584
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,285
Who the first woman to say this was, I
don't know, but somehow it caught on.

585
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,328
So how's my butt?

586
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,916
Not bad. Really?

587
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,626
Yeah. Is it cute though?

588
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,463
I don't know. Are we
grading on a curve?

589
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,799
When was the last time you were out there?

590
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,094
Uh... Uh, uh...

591
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,221
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

592
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,476
Things are a little different now.

593
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,021
First, you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

594
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,858
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

595
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,944
Then you have tests, then
you get to do it with a condom.

596
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,905
The good news is you split the cheque.

597
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't think I could let
a woman pay for dinner.

598
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,952
Great! They'll throw a parade
in your honour.

599
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,997
You'll be Man of the
Year in Seattle Magazine.

600
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,084
Tiramisu.

601
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,504
What is tiramisu?
You'll find out.

602
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,172
Well, what is it? You'll see.

603
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,133
Some woman is gonna want me to
do it to her, and I'm not gonna know.

604
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,635
You'll love it.

605
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,387
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

606
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,390
Tough, tough. It's gonna be
much tougher than I thought.

607
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,811
What about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

608
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,396
Victoria? Yeah. She's perky.

609
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, no, I don't... What?

610
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,401
I'm far away from that.
What? No.

611
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,695
I'm just assembling notes. I'm not...
Notes.

612
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,406
How would I do that?
What do you mean? Call her up.

613
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,719
You say, "Come, let's get
together. We'll look at swatches."

614
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,411
Call her on the phone to say,
"Let's look at swatches"?

615
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,933
Yeah, you know, colour schemes.
She's not gonna see through that?

616
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,334
No, you don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

617
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,795
Think Cary Grant.

618
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,465
Cary Grant would call up and say,
"Come over and look at my swatches"?

619
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,010
How do you know? Maybe he
did. He didn't do it in the movies.

620
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,179
Gunga Din? He didn't call...?

621
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,723
Gunga Din is not a swatch kind of movie.

622
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,686
Who knows what he did in real life.
He did that with Dyan Cannon?

623
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,979
Yeah, sure.

624
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,815
"Hello, Dyan!
Take a look at these swatches."

625
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,044
Jonah, I'm home!

626
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,258
Hey, Jonah!

627
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,516
Jonah?

628
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:07,149
Hey, Jonah.

629
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,861
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

630
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,824
Well, it's nice to meet you, Jessica.

631
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,326
Dad, this is amazing.

632
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,162
If you play this backwards,
it says "Paul is dead."

633
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,582
Yeah, yeah. I know.

634
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,417
How do you know?

635
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,214
Dad, could you shut the door?

636
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,549
Sure. Sure.

637
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,052
H and G.

638
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,430

Hello, Victoria?

648
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,552
This is Sam Baldwin. I don't
know if you remember me, but...

649
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,638
Oh, great.

650
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,598
Hi. Uh...

651
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,352
I was wondering if, uh...

652
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,856
If you would like to have a drink with me?

653
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,774
Dinner?

654
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,528
Dinner would be even better.

655
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,282
Friday would be great, yeah.

656
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,493
How...? I hear
that's a good place.

657
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,081
7:30 would be fine.

658
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,751
And I'll, uh...

659
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,797
Okay, I'll meet you there.
Okay. All right.

660
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:41,511
Um... So it's Friday
at 7:30 for dinner.

661
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,513
Great.

662
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,641
Me too. Bye.

663
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,228
♪ <i>Back in the saddle again</i> ♪♪

664
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,734
Are you in love with him?

665
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,405
I'm not now.

666
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:05,118
Now those were the days when
people knew how to be in love.

667
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,245
You're a basket case.
They knew it.

668
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,416
Time, distance, nothing could
separate them because they knew.

669
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:15,754
It was right. It was real. It was...
It's a movie.

670
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,802
That's your problem.
You don't wanna be in love.

671
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,925
You wanna be in love in a movie.

672
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,885
Read it to me.

673
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:27,557
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never
written a letter like this in my life..."

674
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,144
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

675
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,689
I know that. You
think I don't know that?

676
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,443
What about Walter? Oh, Walter.

677
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,446
Oh, I'd give anything to marry Walter.

678
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,782
He's so unexpected.

679
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,662
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

680
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,415
I should write something
in this about magic.

681
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,917
What?
Something! What if I never meet him?

682
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,753
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

683
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,631
Your destiny can be your
doom. Look at me and Rick.

684
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,967
"I want to meet you"...

685
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,487
Top of the Empire State Building.

686
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,387
On the top of the Empire State Building.

687
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,766
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

688
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:14,062
I'll be in New York with
Walter. I can squeeze it in.

689
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:18,024
I'll be in New York with Walter!

690
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,159
Do you wanna hear about destiny?

691
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,702
If I hadn't married Martin

692
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,954
I never would've bought
the house with the dead tree.

693
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,081
On account of which I got divorced.

694
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:37,335
On account of which I hit a car and
met Rick while buying a neck brace.

695
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,756
Wait a minute. You never told me you
got a divorce because of a dead tree?

696
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:46,052
The tree man.
You fell in love with the tree man?

697
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,139
I did not say "love."
Did I say "love"?

698
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,100
This is my favourite part.

699
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,770
It's now or never.

700
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,940
Never is a frightening word.

701
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,611
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

702
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,196
Uh-huh.

703
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:10,202
Winter must be cold for
those with no warm memories.

704
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:16,082
- We've already missed the spring.
- Yes.

705
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,461
Men never get this movie.

706
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,421
I know.

707
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,343
Mummy! Mummy!

708
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,347
Mummy! It's okay. It's okay.

709
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,974
I'm here. I'm coming. Dad!

710
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,144
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay.

711
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,773
Hey, it's all right. It's okay.

712
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:42,567
What was that about, huh?
It was sinking.

713
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,069
What was? Our house.

714
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,321
There was water coming in all the windows.

715
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,031
Oh.

716
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,951
Well, it's okay now.

717
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,747
So, what should we do?

718
00:47:55,957 --> 00:48:00,752
Your mother used to sing to
you when you had bad dreams.

719
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,588
"Bye Bye Blackbird."

720
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,550
Yeah.

721
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,426
I miss her.

722
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,222
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

723
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,310
I don't know.
Like, do you believe in heaven?

724
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,607
I never did.

725
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:27,696
Or the whole idea of an
afterlife. But now, I don't know.

726
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,615
Because I have these dreams

727
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,327
about your mum.

728
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,415
Yeah. And we have long talks.

729
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,961
About you. How you're doing.

730
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,465
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

731
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,676
So, what is that?

732
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,139
It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?

733
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,891
I'm starting to forget her.

734
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,828
She could peel an apple

735
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,625
in one long, curly strip.

736
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,837

Hi, it's Annie.

760
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,317
Fine, fine. I'm fine.

761
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,988
Listen, I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

762
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,992

someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun,
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.

764
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,039
I'm doing a piece on how people
handle bereavement.

765
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:29,169
And I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

766
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,764
- This is Jonah Baldwin.
- We're not in right now, but you can...

767
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:42,557
Baldwin.

768
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,538
Architect.

769
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,990
- Psst.
- Okay, Clarise.

770
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:26,870
I'm gonna be back either by
midnight or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

771
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,875
Here's one for the both of us.
"Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

772
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,420
If there's any problem, here's
the number to the paediatrician.

773
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,382
Here's a bottle of Ipecac if anybody drinks
poison. It's right next to the juice glasses.

774
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,926
Fine. How do I look?

775
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,305
Great.
Do I look okay? I look all right?

776
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,308
I look stupid. I look stupid. I
look like I'm trying too hard.

777
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,075
I was gonna get a haircut, but
I'd just look like I got a haircut.

778
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,606
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these are grotesque.

779
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,192
I look like I'm trying to be tall.
Her name is Annie Reed.

780
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,029
Now I'm late. Bye.
Dad, read this.

781
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,780
Read this!

782
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,534
"Sleepless and Son..."

783
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:13,499
I've been an excellent third baseman, and
while we're on it, let's just say right now:

784
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,169
Brooks Robinson was the
best third-base men ever.

785
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,732
"It's important you agree with me
on that because I'm from Baltimore."

786
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,299
She thinks Brooks Robinson
is the greatest. So do you.

787
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,177
Everyone thinks so. It's a sign.

788
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,471
Come here.

789
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,015
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

790
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,184
All right.

791
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,061
Where's Seattle?

792
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,521
Right. Where is Baltimore?

793
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,232
Ah! It's right there! Look!

794
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,029
One, two, three. There's, like, 26 states
between here and there. Now, that's a sign.

795
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:47,909
I'm out of here. Goodbye!
Good night! I love you.

796
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,289
Clarise, did you move your car?

797
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,457
Huh?

798
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,219
Thank you, Derrick.
You're welcome.

799
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,887
I'll have...
White wine spritzer?

800
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,430
Yes. And you, sir?

801
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:10,974
I'm fine. Thank you.

802
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,183
Hi. Hi.

803
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:16,187
You look good.
You look good yourself.

804
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,027
I thought you'd never call me.

805
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,737
You did? I really wanted you to.

806
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,864
And I thought you were never going to.

807
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,658
Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin? Yes.

808
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,119
There's a phone call for you.

809
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:33,538
Excuse me.

810
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,711
Thank you. Hello.

811
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,006
Dad, can we go to New
York City for Valentine's Day?

812
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,384
What? Annie Reed from Baltimore

813
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:51,764
wants to meet us at the top of the
Empire State Building on Valentine's Day.

814
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,850
Jonah? What?

815
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,436
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

816
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,688
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

817
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,441
No.
This is the only reason for this call?

818
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,318
If we book now, we can
get an excursion fare.

819
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:09,323
Jessica's parents are travel agents...
I'm not having this conversation.

820
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,492
We'll talk about it at a later time.

821
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,038
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

822
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,881
Everything all right? Oh, yeah.

823
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,883
Do you have kids? No.

824
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,509
Do you want mine?

825
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,639
I'll have an Absolut straight up, please.

826
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,536
Hey, hey! Put that down.
Stop it!

827
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,497
There she is.

828
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,065
Why is she bringing
those groceries?

829
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,327
She's gonna cook us something

830
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,711
so be prepared. Hi, Sam. Thanks.

831
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,339
Thanks. And let me guess.

832
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,341
You must be Jonah.

833
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,011
Hi.

834
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,763
So this it? Yeah.

835
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,516
The car's down this way. Great.

836
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:21,229
She's on her sixth painter and
we are never going to finish this job.

837
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,232
Now she wants the fireplace rebricked.

838
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,359
I know her.
I could give her a call.

839
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,987
No, I've got it solved. I'll just
hit her with one of those bricks.

840
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,494
That's so funny.
You're so funny.

841
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:42,708
When she wants something done she says, "Oh, I
don't know. I'm stupid. You know what's best.

842
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:48,131
But couldn't we flip the house around so
that everything in the back is now in front?

843
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:54,387
And could the whole front of the house open on
a hinge so I can get in with a garage opener."

844
00:57:54,555 --> 00:58:00,852
"Yes, we can. We'll just..."
"Move the kitchen cabinets."

845
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,779
Hey, Jonah, bring some of
that stuff around, all right?

846
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,991
Do you like baseball?

847
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,079
Yes, I do. In fact my firm has box seats to
the Mariners. Why don't we all go some time.

848
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,539
Hey!

849
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,208
What about camping?
What about it?

850
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,627
Do you like camping?

851
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,754
I went camping once.

852
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,466
You know, Dad, we should
start camping more often.

853
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,511
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

854
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,266
It's only 10:00.
Yeah, 10:00. Time for bed.

855
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,059
Good night.

856
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,066
Hey, don't you wanna thank
Victoria for this delicious dinner?

857
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:54,322
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

858
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:59,160
I'm glad you liked it.
Good night, Jonah.

859
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,626
Yeah, we don't see a lot of
potatoes around here. We're rice men.

860
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,981
Oh, God.

861
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,428
Oh! Oh! Ow.

862
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,267
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

863
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,064
- Hello.
- Turn on your radio.

864
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,483
What? The kid is on.

865
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,902
You've got me listening to
this garbage. Go, turn it on.

866
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,570
Who is it?

867
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,617
It's Becky. She's having
trouble with Rick again.

868
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,787
I'll go downstairs.
Becky, I'll call you back.

869
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,293
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

870
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,274
He's kissing her right this minute!

871
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:54,483
Oh, really?

872
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,446
Jonah, tell the truth:
Are you spying on your father?

873
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:03,492
- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.

874
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,536
How will I explain this to Walter?

875
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,121
She came over and cooked dinner.

876
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:11,334
She brought two bags of groceries
like she was staying here for a year!

877
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,046
Jonah, it's good that your
father's dating. It's just hard on you.

878
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:19,383
It's something you think you want,
but then when it happens, it scares you.

879
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:20,593
That's not true.

880
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:21,886
Okay, now think.

881
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:26,182
Shouldn't your father be the judge of
whether someone is right or wrong for him?

882
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,642
He's not sane enough
to judge anything.

883
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:34,690
Now he's kissing her on the lips. My dad's
been captured by a ho! What am I going to do?

884
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:39,570
Jonah, calm down. Tomorrow,
when you're sitting down to breakfast,

885
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:45,618
tell him how you feel. It's not good
to keep your feelings inside you.

886
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:54,752
Miss Scarlet. In the broom
closet. With the radio.

887
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,799
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

888
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,262
I thought I saw a black widow spider.

889
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,099
You scared me to death.
You scared Victoria to death.

890
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,350
It was right over there.

891
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:13,437
Next time you think you see a
black widow spider I want you to say:

892
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:17,691
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe a
poisonous insect is in the house."

893
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,320
And I will calmly come and take care of it.
You scream like that again, I'll kill you.

894
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,281
Becky heard this guy on the
radio, she was sure it was Rick.

895
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,825
She was completely hysterical.

896
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:31,539
And then it turned out the guy
lived in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

897
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,374
That doesn't make any sense.

898
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,710
I know. I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

899
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:42,591
Thank God my life is in place.
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

900
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,900
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

901
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,861
You think so?

902
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,614
It's Y-O-H. Yeah. What's that?

903
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,533
Your only hope.

904
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:24,675
I thought I would look into doing
a story on those radio shows.

905
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,219
You'd have to go somewhere
to really look into them.

906
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,472
Definitely.

907
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,745
Couldn't you do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.

908
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:57,208
I won't be in Chicago long.
When you get back, I'll be gone.

909
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,504
Then I'll see you in New York.
I'll get it.

910
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,763
- This is Captain Browning.
- We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

911
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:16,393
The weather is clear to the west
and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

912
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,188
Don't you hate flying?
Yes, I do.

913
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:24,443
And I've just told the most terrible
one to the man I'm about to marry.

914
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,905
Do you feel that any lie is a betrayal?

915
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:31,909
I said flying. Oh.

916
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,670
Thanks for bringing me here.
Well, he likes the planes.

917
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,047
Can I bring something
back for you? A souvenir?

918
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,757
Does he like those little snow globes?

919
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:49,635
You know, you shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

920
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:53,639
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

921
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,687
He's 8. He's good at it.

922
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:03,482
I've read an article about this.
Children are hideous at the age of 8.

923
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,900
It's quite normal. Well...

924
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,695
Maybe when I come back, the two of us

925
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:12,032
ought to spend some time together
on our own. What do you think?

926
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:19,039
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

927
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,541
Bye.

928
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,131
Jonah.

929
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,801
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

930
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:36,098
I hardly know her myself.
She's, in fact, a mystery to me.

931
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,851
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

932
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:42,896
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

933
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,482
Could she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

934
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,237
These are the things I'm
willing to get to the bottom of.

935
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:54,533
That is why I am dating her.

936
01:05:54,701 --> 01:06:00,080
That's all I'm doing. I'm not
living with her. I'm not marrying her.

937
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,792
Can you appreciate the difference?

938
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,589
This is what single people do. They
try other people on and see how they fit.

939
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:14,845
But everybody's an adjustment. Nobody's
perfect. There's no such thing as a perfect...

940
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,613
Come on.

941
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,035
Dad, I was talking to
Jessica about reincarnation.

942
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,204
She says you knew Annie in another life.

943
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:43,707
Who's Annie?
The one who wrote us.

944
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,395
But Jessica says, you and Annie
never got together in that life.

945
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,588
So your hearts are like
puzzles with missing pieces.

946
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,359
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

947
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,008
Goddamn it.

948
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,885
The reason I know this and you don't,

949
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:59,473
is because I'm younger and pure, so
I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.

950
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:00,974
Who told you this stuff?

951
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,184
Jessica.

952
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,187
I sincerely hope you're
not marrying Jessica.

I watched him play with
his son at the beach.

979
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,689
Did you talk to him?

980
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,816
Couldn't do it.

981
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,069
How did I get here?

982
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,196
You told a lie and got on a plane.

983
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,574
That's not what I mean.

984
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,702
I'm going back over there tomorrow

985
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,412
and talk to him. I am.

986
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,416
Okay. Good. Goodbye. Beck.

987
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,376
What?

988
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:20,799
Is this crazy?
No, that's the weirdest part about it.

989
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:25,721
Thank you. I love you.
I love you too.

990
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,015
Good night. Bye.

991
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,497
It's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

992
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:02,275
Hello.

993
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,994
- So then what happened?
- So then I left, obviously.

994
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,247
You were standing in
the middle of the street?

995
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:19,095
You know that dream when you're walking down
the street naked and everyone is looking at you.

996
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,502
I love that dream.

997
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,798
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing!

998
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,883
But he saw you, right?
He saw me.

999
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,137
You were face to face.
He said hello.

1000
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,704
He said hello.
And what did you say?

1001
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:36,018
And all I could say was hello.
Oh, my God.

1002
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:42,524
All I could say was hello.
It's a sign.

1003
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:47,821
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1004
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,742
So stupid! From the minute
I listened to that stupid program me

1005
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,619
on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

1006
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,665
You are not a jerk.
Thank you. An idiot!

1007
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,794
You don't know who she was, Annie.
I saw her. I have a picture of her.

1008
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,337
I'll show you a picture of her.

1009
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,299
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1010
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:11,094
Here! See, that's
exactly what she looks like.

1011
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,431
This is a picture of someone's back.

1012
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,100
Well, it's her and he was crazy about her.

1013
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:21,104
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1014
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,948
Becky.

1015
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:36,495
So I mailed your letter.

1016
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:41,208
"Dear Annie. Thanks for
your letter. It was great."

1017
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,251
You sound neat.

1018
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:52,886
We're very excited about meeting you in New
York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are...

1019
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,348
M-F-E-O.

1020
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,727
"See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

1021
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,688
M-F-E-O?

1022
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,735
Made for each other.

1023
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,698
It's cute. It's like a little clue.

1024
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,665
So he can't write. Big deal.

1025
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,292
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy.

1026
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,504
And our pathetic need for it is
what gets us into so much trouble.

1027
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:31,258
I'm going to run back to
Walter's arms, if he'll still have me.

1028
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,717
What about the letter?

1029
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,681
It's nothing. It was written before
I went out there. Before the ho.

1030
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,687
The only thing is, she
didn't look like a ho.

1031
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,315
She looked like somebody we
would have been friends with.

1032
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,360
Ugh!

1033
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,488
You saw her in the airport and then here?

1034
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,736
And I tried to talk to her. It was like I
knew her or something. It was weird.

1035
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,368
You mean like a déjà-vu thing?

1036
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,746
It was very French déjà-vu-ish
kind of thing. Oui?

1037
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:06,042
Oui. At least you're out there seeing
people again. That's terrific.

1038
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,253
Well, I mean, there's really just the one.

1039
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,549
Victoria.
You don't like Victoria?

1040
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,760
She laughs like a hyena.
Is this true?

1041
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,220
No!

1042
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:21,099
Sort of. Yeah, a little bit.
But, tell them what you did.

1043
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,949
- Dad...
- Tell them about the radio show.

1044
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,144
Go ahead. Dad...

1045
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:26,123
They wanna hear it. Go
ahead. Tell them. Tell them.

1046
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,691
Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1047
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:34,571
And tells them I need a new wife.
Oh, you're kidding.

1048
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,740
That's so sweet.

1049
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:39,701
Now he's obsessed with
this one woman who wrote me.

1050
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:40,952
Are you serious? Yeah.

1051
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,747
She wants to meet me at the
top of Empire State Building.

1052
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,374
On Valentine's Day.

1053
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,085
It's like that movie.
What movie?

1054
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,172
An Affair to Remember.
Did you ever see it?

1055
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:57,469
Oh, God. Cary Grant and Deborah
Kerr. Is that "Karr" or "Kerr"?

1056
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,221
Kerr. Karr.

1057
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:03,391
Okay. She's gonna meet him at
the top of the Empire State Building.

1058
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,228
Only she got hit by a taxi.

1059
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:11,566
And he waited and waited.
And it was raining, I think.

1060
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:18,198
And then she's too proud
to tell him that she's

1061
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:26,456
crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

1062
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:30,502
But he comes to see her anyway.
And I forget why, but...

1063
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,382
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her.

1064
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:39,511
Because he doesn't even notice
that she doesn't get up to say hello.

1065
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,098
And he's very bitter.

1066
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:48,728
You think he's just going to walk
out the door and never know why.

1067
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,273
She's just lying there, you know.

1068
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:57,070
Like, on the couch with this
blanket over her shrivelled little legs.

1069
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,989
And...

1070
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,658
Are you all right? She's fine.

1071
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:05,578
And suddenly, he goes,
"I saw the painting".

1072
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:09,040
And he, like, goes to the bedroom.

1073
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,543
And he looks, and he
comes out and looks at her.

1074
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:16,715
And he kind of just...
They know and hug and it's so...

1075
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:21,636
That's a chick's movie.
I would say so.

1076
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:25,140
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1077
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,684
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1078
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:28,935
Desperate women.

1079
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,564
Just because someone is looking for a
nice guy, it doesn't make them desperate.

1080
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,167
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1081
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,233
No.

1082
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,754
It's easier to be killed by a
terrorist than to find a husband

1083
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,238
after the age of 40...
That is absolutely untrue!

1084
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,782
Right, honey. Right.

1085
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,784
Well, I'm not looking
for a mail-order bride.

1086
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:48,955
I just want somebody that I can have
a decent conversation with over dinner.

1087
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:52,834
You know, without it falling down into weepy
tears over some movie that she just saw.

1088
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,461
She's very emotional.

1089
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,440
Although, I cried at the
end of The Dirty Dozen.

1090
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,024
Well, who didn't?
Jim Brown was throwing

1091
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,216
these hand grenades down these air shafts.

1092
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:04,846
And Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin we sitting
on top of this armoured personnel carrier.

1093
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,515
They were dressed up like Nazis.
And it was...

1094
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,809
Trini Lopez... Trini Lopez...

1095
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:13,646
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1096
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,148
Stop it!

1097
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:20,153
Richard Jaeckel, at the beginning, he had
on a shiny helmet, because he was an MP.

1098
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:25,075
Please, no more.
God, I love that movie.

1099
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,252
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1100
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,171
What's so great about it?

1101
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,673
You have to find her, Jonah.
You have to go to her.

1102
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,009
Do you know how much money
it costs to go to New York?

1103
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:47,847
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

1104
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,474
How much money do you have?

1105
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,309
80 dollars.

1106
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:55,605
I have 42. That'll probably cover cabs.
But how would I get there?

1107
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,983
Honey, I have to run these
tickets over to someone.

1108
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,351
Can you keep an eye on things
out front till I get back?

1109
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,862
Sure, Mum.

1110
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,043
You want a window seat or aisle?
Window.

1111
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,087
You want a fruit plate?
I don't know. Do I?

1112
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,006
I'd rather die than eat airplane food.

1113
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,319
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied

1114
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:26,613
and the stewardess won't carry
you around and stuff like that.

1115
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,180
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1116
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:32,058
If it's in the computer,
they'll believe anything.

1117
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:34,310
Are you sure?

1118
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,957
Do you want me to say that you're
really, really short for your age,

1119
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,000
and they shouldn't say anything
because it would hurt your feelings?

1120
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,276
Yeah. That's a great idea!

You're gonna miss the train.
No, I'm not.

1125
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:11,097

feel happy. This is right. This is real.

1126
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,745
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies.

1127
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:16,436
And you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1128

Please, don't tell anybody what happened.

I was just... I was just...

1139
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,985
Go ahead. No, you go.

1140
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:10,698
Okay. Well, I was just gonna
say that ever since Christmas

1141
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:15,828
you've been different,
kind of distracted, distant.

1142
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:22,293
But now it feels as if you're coming
back from wherever you were.

1143
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,087
I am.

1144
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,215
I was just...

1145
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:31,970
I just... I just got...
I think I got nervous.

1146
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,556
But that's normal, right?

1147
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:39,561
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about... you know?

1148
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,107
What? Forever.

1149
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,944
No.

1150
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,740
Well...

1151
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,994
I did.

1152
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:01,457
And... You know what I think? I think
I thought it was too perfect, you know.

1153
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,669
I started to wonder if
we were the human equivalent

1154
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,338
of two rights making a wrong.

1155
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,090
You know what it was?

1156
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:14,304
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1157
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,847
You have to grow up.

1158
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:19,475
You just can't keep having all
these adolescent fantasies about

1159
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,311
how exciting life is gonna be.

1160
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,188
Don't hate me, but I love this pattern.

1161
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,565
You couldn't. I do.

1162
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:29,110
This is just like my grandmother's china.

1163
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,362
How many place settings?

1164
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,781
Ten. Ten.

1165
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:40,204
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is.

1166
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,998
Too many.

1167
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,858
Walter. It was my mother's.

1168
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,112
I had them size it down.

1169
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:16,699
She had really fat fingers.

1170
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:23,414
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick out

1171
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:27,752
if I had every ring in the whole
world to choose from.

1172
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,089
You see what I mean?

1173
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:34,634
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises,

1174
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:39,055
but I am not one of
those people. No, siree.

1175
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,558
Surprises are highly overrated.

1176
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,539
I'm leaving first thing
in the morning,

1177
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,043
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1178
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,108
Clarise is gonna be here.

1179
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:54,237
So you'll be able to see plenty of Geraldo and
Nightmare on Elm Street 12. I will never know.

1180
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:59,325
Are you going with her?
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1181
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,080
Don't try anything tricky.
Understand?

1182
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,461
Don't go rolling in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house.

1183
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:14,048
Or lock yourself in the closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1184
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:16,300
If your finger falls off, it's staying off.

1185
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,628
No one's gonna pack it on
ice and take you to hospital,

1186
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,055
so that you can be a
breakthrough in laser surgery.

1187
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,850
Is this about that woman in Baltimore?

1188
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,144
Annie.

1189
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,066
I don't care what you do!
Good! Fine!

1190
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,026
I'll tell you what I'm doing this weekend.

1191
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,946
I'm getting laid.
1990s and nobody's getting laid.

1192
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:40,199
I'm the only man in the America
who's getting laid this weekend.

1193
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:44,662
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college. Maybe seven.

1194
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,540
How long have you been there?

1195
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:48,750
Forever.

1196
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,126
What did you hear me just say?

1197
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,628
"Six girls in college.
Maybe seven."

1198
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:55,757
Seven. Eight! Mary Kelly.

1199
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,091
This is the one I like.

1200
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:03,264
Jonah, the fact is, you're
not gonna like any woman,

1201
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,099
because it isn't your mother.

1202
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,934
How do you know?

1203
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,563
What's wrong with Annie?
Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1204
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:14,567
Shut up? Shut up? Mum
never said shut up to me.

1205
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,736
Mum never yelled at me.

1206
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,822
This conversation is finished.
Why can't we go to New York?

1207
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,283
There is no way that
we are going on a plane

1208
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,952
to meet some woman who
could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1209
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,830
Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
You wouldn't let me.

1210
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:30,291
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit out of me.

1211
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,044
It scared the shit out of
every man in America!

1212
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,173
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1213
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,722
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

1214
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,933
That's good!
You'll have a lot to tell Oprah

1215
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,684
how your dad destroyed your life

1216
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,688
because he had to go off for a
weekend special at the Holiday Inn!

1217
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,833
Jonah, Clarise is here and I've got to go.

1218
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,961
Hey, Jonah.

1219
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:18,923
Jonah?

1220
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:26,389
All right. Jonah, listen,
I've got to go.

1221
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,519
Jonah.

1222
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,481
Hey, Jonah.

1223
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,669
Jonah!

1224
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,503
Jessica, honey.
You have tell us where he is.

1225
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,256
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1226
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,635
Jessica, this is your father. Tell
us where he is. Right this minute!

1227
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,600
- N-Y.
- What is that?

1228
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,851
"No way."

1229
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:13,728
That's N-W!

1230
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:18,816
New York. He's on
his way to New York.

1231
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,276
What? How?

1232
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:23,487
- United, 597.
- Jessica.

1233
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,573
When does it leave?
Seven thirty.

1234
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,041
Here you go.
Here's a nice pin for you

1235
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,876
for flying with us. Thank you.

1236
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,604
You're welcome.
Can I take this for you?

1237
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,546
No.

1238
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,189
Where to, kid?
Empire State Building.

1239
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,024
Hold on.

1240
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,275
Empire State Building.

1241
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,528
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1242
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:11,744
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

1243
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,122
No, I'm going to meet my new mother.

1244
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,979
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?

1245
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,606
No, I'm Cynthia.

1246
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,366
Excuse me, are you Annie?

1247
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,032
Great table. Thanks.

1248
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,577
Is something wrong?

1249
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:38,497
Can I get you a drink?
Some champagne?

1250
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,084
Fine. Fine.

1251
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:46,630
Can we have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

1252
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,010
Just kidding. It was a joke.

1253
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:54,180
He meant Dom Perignon. I got it.

1254
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,935
Ohh. Beautiful view.

1255
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:04,648
Walter... There's
something I have to tell you.

1256
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:20,873
Hey! Sorry, I have an emergency.

1257
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:26,879
Money, money, money, see?

1258
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:47,251
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

1259
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,919
No.

1260
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,838
I guess he could be.

1261
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,132
No.

1262
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,594
It's not him, Walter. It's me.

1263
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,555
I can't do this.

1264
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:08,355
Look, Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

1265
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,193
I don't want to be someone
that you're settling for.

1266
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,113
I don't want to be someone
that anyone settles for.

1267
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:22,745
Marriage is hard enough without
bringing such low expectations into it.

1268
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:24,788
Isn't it?

1269
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:28,292
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1270
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:31,712
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

1271
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,424
But okay.

1272
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,900
You okay?

1273
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,361
Yeah.

1274
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:03,452
What? Look.

1275
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:14,672
It's a sign. Who needed a sign?

1276
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:19,760
Walter, I have to go.

1277
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:37,361
Jonah!

1278
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,657
Dad! Dad! Jonah?

1279
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:59,049
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

1280
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:02,011
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1281
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,265
What would I have done?

1282
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:09,601
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1283
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,187
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1284
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,275
We're doing okay, aren't we?
I mean, are we okay?

1285
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,859
Aren't we all right? So far,
have I done anything stupid?

1286
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,068
No.

1287
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,029
Have I screwed it up for the both of us?

1288
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,031
No.

1289
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:17,336
Observation deck?
Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1290
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:20,839
Oh. No, please.
I really need to get up there.

1291
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:23,467
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1292
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,308
Listen

1293
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,770
can I just take a look? There's
someone I was supposed to meet.

1294
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:40,359
He's probably not there, but if I don't
at least look, I'll always wonder about it.

1295
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:43,862
Cary Grant, right?
You know that movie?

1296
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,824
It's one of my wife's favourites.

1297
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:58,502
Maybe when we get home, we'll get a dog.

1298
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,379
Okay.

1299
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:02,256
What do you mean, okay?

1300
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:05,759
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1301
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:21,191
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1302
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:27,865
Can I take a minute? Go ahead.

1303
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:44,233
I left it by the telescopes.

1304
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:12,844
It's you. It's me.

1305
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:16,181
I saw you in the street.

1306
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:20,602
Are you Annie? Yes.

1307
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,232
You're Annie?

1308
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:32,239
This must be yours. I'm Jonah.

1309
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,741
This is my dad. His name is Sam.

1310
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,493
Hi, Jonah.

1311
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,830
Sam.

1312
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:46,503
And who's this? Howard.

1313
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:49,590
Oh, Howard. Hello, Howard.

1314
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:06,231
We'd better go.

1315
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:14,948
