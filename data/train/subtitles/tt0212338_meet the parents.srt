1
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,103
I know we haven't
been together that long,

2
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,524
but these last ten months have
just been the happiest of my life.

3
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,862
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend,

4
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,574
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

5
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,536
Will you marry me?

6
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,830
Yes.

7
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,458
Seriously.
Do you think that sounds good?

8
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,710
– No!
– Really?

9
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,963
– 'Cause I think that kinda sums up…
– No!

10
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,090
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

11
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,427
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

12
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,763
Well, thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.

13
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,434
You've got a real
gentle touch there, doctor.

14
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,728
She won't be able to say no.

15
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:10,066
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

16
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,071
– Good luck, Greg.
– Thanks, Kim.

17
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,238
Good luck, buddy.

18
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,790
OK, it's time
for our problem of the week.

19
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,626
I want you to pick out your problem,

20
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,462
a problem that's been
bothering you all week,

21
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,840
with your eyes still closed…

22
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,386
…I want you to picture that problem
in your mind.

23
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,138
Pretend that it's right there
in front of you.

24
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,557
Not only are you my best friend,

25
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,811
but you're also the person I
wanna spend the rest of my life with.

26
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,774
I love you.
Will you… marry me?

27
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,612
Now I want you to scare your
problems away. I want you to say, «boo.»

28
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,823
Boo.

29
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,283
– Boo!
– Boo!

30
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,246
All right, you guys are great.

31
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,582
Very good. I will see you guys
after lunch, all right?

32
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,335
Hey, Pam, isn't that
your special friend outside?

33
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,131
Yeah, I think so.

34
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,174
Why don't you go talk to him?

35
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,927
– You think I should?
– Yeah.

36
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,765
Come here.

37
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,687
– Hi, sweetie.
– How you doin'?

38
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,189
– What's going on?
– I just was in the neighborhood.

39
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,817
Got off work early. Thought maybe
you wanted to get a bite to eat.

40
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,820
Oh, that's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

41
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,449
Oh, shoot, I forgot to change my shoes.

42
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,743
You don't have to change. I can't
resist a man in nurse's shoes.

43
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,121
I know, but I got sneakers
in my backpack.

44
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,249
– It'll just take a second.
– OK.

45
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,793
Honey…

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,379
– Pam, I love you.
– Yeah?

47
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,841
I love you, too.
Come on, sweetie.

48
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,219
I got a half hour before I have to be
back, so you wanna go have lunch?

49
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,475
– What are you doing?
– Nothing.

50
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,019
I just love you so much.

51
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:14,064
These last ten months have been
the happiest of my life.

52
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:18,277
Yeah, they've been amazing.
What's going on?

53
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:22,823
Nothing. I just…
I just feel like we're so close.

54
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,702
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and…

55
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,246
Are you OK, sweetie?
You're acting so weird.

56
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,998
I'm fine.
I just got a crick in my neck.

57
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,043
I was doing CPR on a 300 pound
crack addict this morning.

58
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,753
Want me to massage your neck
or something?

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,421
– No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm good.
– A back rub? Are you sure?

60
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,507
Your kids, they're trying
to tell you something.

61
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,009
– What? Hold on.
– Look!

62
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,845
– Oh, it's my sister. Hello? Hi!
<i>– I'm engaged!</i>

63
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,139
<i>Bob and I are getting married
in two weeks!</i>

64
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,892
You're engaged! That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

65
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:54,438
Oh, my God, you're getting married
in two weeks. That's a little soon.

66
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:58,609
Wow, Mom and Dad really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was OK with this?

67
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:02,071
<i>– Well, Bob asked Dad.</i>
– Wow, that was very thoughtful of him.

68
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,657
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

69
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,159
Yeah.

70
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:11,288
I'm just here with Greg. He's gonna
take me out for lunch. He's OK.

71
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,958
OK, yeah, I know you gotta go.
All right. I love you.

72
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,668
OK, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

73
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,671
So what's going on? What?
Debbie's marrying that guy?

74
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,133
Yeah, in two weeks. Dr. Bob of Denver.
Isn't that great?

75
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,096
Yeah, yeah, that's… Didn't they
just meet like a few months ago?

76
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,473
Well, yeah, but, you know,
he asked her, and she said yes.

77
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,725
He asked my dad. He said yes.
Then he asked Debbie.

78
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,646
Yeah, I overheard that. So, what,
like he had to ask his permission?

79
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,815
No, no, he didn't have to.

80
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,193
Bob understood that Dad appreciates
that kind of thing, you know?

81
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,780
Anyway, Deb said
that Dad's crazy about him.

82
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,117
Evidently, Bob bought him
the perfect gift that won him over.

83
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,995
– You know?
– Really? A gift?

84
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,373
Are you sure it's OK to X-ray this?

85
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,667
Yeah, it's not gonna mutate or anything.

86
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,007
– Sir, that's not gonna fit.
– Wait. Hang on a second.

87
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,594
The bag's too big, guy.
You gotta check it.

88
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,430
Over here.

89
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,682
– Raise your arms, sir.
– Look.

90
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,310
I've got an engagement ring
for my girlfriend in the bag.

91
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,438
I can't really open it here.
Don't you think I can just carry it on?

92
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,732
Hey, pal, if it ain't
fittin' through the frame,

93
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,276
you ain't carryin' it on the plane.

94
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,946
– 531. New York La Guardia. Check it.
– Wait, wait!

95
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,906
– Excuse me!
– Don't worry, pal.

96
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,200
It'll be waitin' for you
on the other side.

97
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,708
<i>Welcome to New York's
La Guardia Airport.</i>

98
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,886
Excuse me. Hi.

99
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,805
You lost my bag, and there's
a two-carat diamond ring inside it.

100
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,891
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

101
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:57,895
But put your local address on this form,
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

102
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,522
What if it doesn't? Am I supposed
to spend the entire weekend

103
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,399
with just the clothes on my back?

104
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,239
It's a great gift. I just thought
you were gonna get them champagne.

105
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,242
I think your dad is gonna be
very psyched about this gift.

106
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,411
Well, don't forget he's retired, though.

107
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,082
The guy was in the rare-flower business.
I think he still maintains an interest.

108
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,293
You make it sound like
they're really hard to please.

109
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,586
No, not at all!

110
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,297
He's the sweetest man
in the whole world. Just relax!

111
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,426
– He's gonna love you. I promise.
– As much as he loves Dr. Bob?

112
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,055
Take it easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is entirely wasted on my parents.

113
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,557
What, are they Amish?

114
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,021
OK, no jokes.

115
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,442
– What are you doing?
– What?

116
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,737
I told you my dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

117
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,364
OK, all right,
I'll leave 'em in the car.

118
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,491
No, no, no, no, he'll check there.

119
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,743
– Oh, gosh.
– What…

120
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah, the roof is
probably a better idea.

121
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,959
Hey. Oh, and…

122
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,753
…we're not living together.

123
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,798
– I thought you said you told him.
– Well…

124
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,052
– Hi, Daddy! Hi!
– Sweet pea!

125
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,014
– I missed you so much, Pamcake.
– I missed you too, Flapjack.

126
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,105
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

127
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,775
Short stack, short stack, coming up.

128
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,654
Where's my «wittle» girl?

129
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,992
– Mommy! Mom!
– You look so beautiful.

130
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,578
So do you. Look at you.

131
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,913
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

132
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,207
Hi, Greg.
I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.

133
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,333
Great to finally meet you.

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,086
– Good meeting you.
– And I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.

135
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,548
Oh…

136
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,677
What are you driving there, a Ford?

137
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,680
Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus.

138
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,601
We were gonna get a mid-size, but I
figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks.

139
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,188
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.

140
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,149
Sure. Interesting color. You pick it?

141
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,027
Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

142
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:13,697
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

143
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,659
– But you didn't pick it.
– Jack!

144
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,539
Oh, yucky. What smells
of old sour milk?

145
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,584
– Poor Greg got spit up on by a baby.
– He didn't.

146
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,171
He did, Ma, at the lost luggage
counter. The airline lost his bag.

147
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,881
They didn't!

148
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,508
– Yeah.
– Yeah, they did.

149
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,927
– What about you, honey?
– Oh, no. I carried on.

150
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,720
That's my girl.

151
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,057
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

152
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,228
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.

153
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,148
– That's right. <i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>
– Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.

154
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,609
Yeah.

155
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,614
– Hey, Mom, the house looks great.
– Really? Oh, good.

156
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,909
– We spruced up for the wedding.
– This is so nice.

157
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,246
– We like it.
– Beautiful.

158
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,583
Oh, now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,338
We were curious,
how do you pronounce it?

160
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,924
Oh, just like it's spelled.

161
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,635
F-O-C-K-E-R.

162
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,349
– Focker.
– Focker.

163
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,522
– Oh, I'll get it, honey.
– Oh, thanks, Mom.

164
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,859
– There he is. There's our little guy.
– Jinxy, come here, boy.

165
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,863
Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.

166
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,116
– Come here. Come to Daddy.
– Jinxy!

167
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,119
Come on.
Taught him that in one week.

168
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:46,623
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.
Jinxy, say hello to Greg.

169
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,041
– Wave to Greg.
– Hello, Jinx.

170
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,211
Attaboy.
That took me another week.

171
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,131
– Oh, my gosh.
– Pam, I didn't know you had a cat.

172
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,383
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

173
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,552
Your daddy's found
his new best friend.

174
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,472
You won't believe it.
He even taught him to use the potty.

175
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,475
– He did? Dad, that's kinda weird.
– What's so weird about it?

176
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,477
Now we don't have to smell kitty litter.

177
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,687
– That's right.
– Right?

178
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,940
That's incredible. How did you
teach the cat to use the toilet?

179
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,358
Oh, that was easy, Greg.

180
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,069
I just designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet,

181
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,739
and then once he got used to it,
I took it away.

182
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,241
– Yeah, makes sense.
– I don't think he likes it.

183
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,661
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig, squat and bury.

184
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,331
I had to move
all my potted plants off the floor.

185
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,043
Plus, you got another guy around
the house to leave the seat up.

186
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,839
He can't lift the seat, Greg.

187
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,175
He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs.

188
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:42,512
Ah, right. Opposable…
I didn't think about that.

189
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,764
Jinx is strictly a house cat.

190
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,558
Can't let him outside because
he lacks outdoor survival skills.

191
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,685
One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?

192
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,689
I don't think Greg will be playing
with Jinxy too much. He hates cats.

193
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,693
Pam, I don't hate cats.

194
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,696
I don't hate cats. I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.

195
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,907
– Yeah, yeah.
– I am too.

196
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,617
Well, that's OK
if you hate cats, Greg.

197
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,120
No! I don't.
I don't hate cats at all.

198
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,458
That's OK. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

199
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,461
I… I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,966
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?

201
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,550
Greg, you come with me.

202
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,553
We'll get you something to wear
from Jack's closet, OK?

203
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,056
– OK.
– Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey.

204
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,685
– Yeah?
– I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

205
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,020
Me too, Daddy.

206
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:39,361
Hey, listen, be nice to this one,
OK? I kinda like him.

207
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,739
– OK, I'll try.
– Thank you.

208
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,417
– Shirt fit OK, Greg?
– Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

209
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,460
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

210
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,088
You know, I wish you hadn't
told your parents I hate cats.

211
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,506
But you do hate cats.

212
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,675
You didn't have to tell them
right when we met.

213
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,677
I know. I'm sorry.
It just kinda slipped out.

214
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:08,432
Get your red-hot pu-pus.
My goodness, what is that?

215
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:13,854
Oh, that's just a little something
from me. Go ahead. Open it up.

216
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,566
Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.

217
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,651
Oh, isn't that nice?

218
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:29,286
Oh, look at this. It's a flowerpot
with the dirt in it.

219
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:34,624
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

220
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,211
The bulb of a Jerusalem tulip.

221
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:45,510
Which I was told is one of the rarest
and most beautiful flowers in existence.

222
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,890
Oh, right, right, the Jerusalem…

223
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,518
…from the <i>jerusales tulipesias</i>
genus. Yes, yes.

224
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,774
Anyway, yeah, the guy said
with regular watering,

225
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,400
it should bloom in about
six months, so…

226
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,236
Oh, we'll look forward to that, Greg.

227
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,748
So, Greg, how's your job?

228
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,376
Good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

229
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,255
I… I recently
got transferred to triage.

230
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,257
Oh, is that better than a nurse?

231
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,427
No, Mom, triage is a unit of the E.R.

232
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,721
– It's where all the top nurses work.
– Well…

233
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,015
No, they do.

234
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,644
Not many men in your profession,
though, are there, Greg?

235
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,357
No, Jack, not traditionally.

236
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,488
Oh, Pam, honey, did you know that
your father started his own business?

237
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:50,033
– Really? Dad, that's great.
– Oh, wow!

238
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,452
Yes, I thought with
my knowledge and experience,

239
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,454
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?

240
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,123
– I really admire that.
– Yeah.

241
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,876
So what is it?
What's the new venture?

242
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:04,422
Let me ask you a question, Greg.
Let's just say you have kids

243
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,426
and you wanna get out of the house,
spend a night on the town. You know?

244
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,138
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

245
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,057
References, work experience…
it all checks out fine.

246
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,227
But then how do you
really know for certain

247
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,564
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?

248
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,401
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?

249
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:31,616
– Sure, I think so.
– No, the answer is you cannot.

250
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:38,039
Let me show you something.
Take a look at this, Greg.

251
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,253
What's this look like to you?

252
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,173
This looks like a teddy bear.

253
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,551
Smile, you're on «nanny camera.»

254
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,221
Oh, yeah, yeah! I've seen
these things advertised on TV.

255
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,932
Oh, no, not like this, you haven't.
Take a look.

256
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,271
Oh, my gosh. Hi!
Where's the other camera?

257
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,107
Right here in this decorative artifact.

258
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,444
– Wow, that's great.
– Our cameras are motion-activated,

259
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,030
so they begin taping as soon
as they sense any movement.

260
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,284
We can hide 'em in anything. Mirrors,
lamps, televisions, you name it.

261
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,536
So no matter where you go…

262
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,789
…we'll be watching you.

263
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,961
So, Jack, couldn't this maybe
be construed as illegal?

264
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,546
You know, invasion of privacy?

265
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,134
Trust me, Greg, when you start
having little Fockers running around,

266
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,428
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.

267
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,894
Impressive, isn't it?

268
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,062
Quite.

269
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,275
– Oh, I'll get that.
– I'll get it. Honey, I'll get it.

270
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,361
OK.

271
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,031
Any problem with the documents?

272
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,826
OK. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.

273
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,496
Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.

274
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,040
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent

275
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,376
and ask for the vegetarian special, OK?

276
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,004
Wow. All this
and the wedding's on Sunday?

277
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,008
– Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?
– Nope, wrong number.

278
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,595
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make a run to the store.

279
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,973
That's funny.
I thought I just bought some.

280
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,434
You know how that stuff,
it just goes, so I'll be back in a jiff.

281
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,853
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

282
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,484
Sweetie, you'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.

283
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,112
– Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.
– Yeah.

284
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,906
You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.

285
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,409
– Go on, sweetie.
– Yeah.

286
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,203
OK, unless you want some privacy.

287
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:46,126
– Why would I need privacy?
– No, I didn't think you would.

288
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,545
– OK, let's head out.
– Oh, good.

289
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,715
Bye.

290
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:56,011
Have fun, you guys.
Pam, he seems wonderful.

291
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,806
– He is. We have the best time together.
– Good.

292
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,641
Now, have you two been…?

293
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,395
– Mother!
– Thinking about anything permanent.

294
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,982
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
we haven't really discussed it,

295
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,943
but I definitely
have a feeling this is it.

296
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,905
Dad seems to like him.
Don't you think?

297
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,074
Absolutely.

298
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,415
– Big day, Saturday.
– This car…

299
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,877
Yes. This car is…

300
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,506
You got… What do you use?
Unleaded? Regular unleaded?

301
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,133
Premium.

302
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,559
Hey, you know, Jack, now that
we have a second to talk,

303
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,104
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

304
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,231
I know that we haven't
been together that long,

305
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,611
but the time that we have spent
together has been really incredible.

306
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,362
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

307
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,746
I don't not like cats.
I just… I just prefer dogs.

308
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,249
I mean, I'm just more
of a dog kind of, you know…

309
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:14,130
Come home, wagging their little tails,
happy to see you kind of…

310
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,968
You need that assurance, do you? You
prefer an emotionally shallow animal?

311
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,970
I…

312
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,431
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,

313
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,934
his tail will go between his legs
and cover his genitals,

314
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,560
his ears will go down.

315
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,897
A dog is very easy to break, but cats
make you work for their affection.

316
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,774
They don't sell out the way dogs do.

317
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,326
You like Peter, Paul and Mary?

318
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,416
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

319
00:20:56,172 --> 00:21:00,385
– Great song.
– Yeah, one of my favorites.

320
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,638
Who would've thought it wasn't
really about a dragon, huh?

321
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,933
What do you mean?

322
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,020
You know, the whole drug thing.

323
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,858
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

324
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,530
Some people think that…

325
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,033
…to «Puff the Magic Dragon»
means to…

326
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,618
They're really…

327
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,415
To smoke… to smoke…

328
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,543
A marijuana cigarette.

329
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,380
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

330
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,508
Right.

331
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,389
– Are you a pothead, Focker?
– No! No.

332
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,727
What? No, no, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm, I'm not… I…

333
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,396
I pass on grass all the time.

334
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,565
– I mean, not all the time.
– Yes or no, Greg?

335
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,108
No. Yes. No.

336
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,577
Look, Greg, I'll meet you back
out front in about 12 to 15 minutes.

337
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,704
OK.

338
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,934
– Hey. Hi.
– Hey. How you doing? Hey.

339
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,478
Do you have any of those
nicotine patches?

340
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,898
No. We have the gum.

341
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,111
– Great.
– You chew it.

342
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,615
Thank you. Yes, OK. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?

343
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,910
Mumm's. It's on sale for 13.95.

344
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,954
Really? That's it?
You don't have, like,

345
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,790
a nice, like, 80 or $100 bottle
of something?

346
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,752
You can get
a whole bunch of Mumm's.

347
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,914
– Focker.
– Hey, Jack. Ready to go?

348
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:39,210
I've been ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

349
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,841
– You been waiting here long?
– No, I was just reading up about…

350
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,471
– …pumps.
– Pumps?

351
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,017
Yes. Breast pumps.

352
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,646
I grew up on a farm.

353
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,030
Get your hot buns, hot patooties.

354
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,866
Wow, Dina,
everything looks fabulous.

355
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,369
It's such a treat for me to have
a home-cooked meal like this.

356
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,872
Dinner at my house usually consisted
of everybody in the kitchen

357
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,874
fighting over containers
of Chinese food.

358
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,794
You poor thing. What, there
wasn't enough food to go around?

359
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:26,174
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.

360
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,136
Greg, would you like to say grace?

361
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,057
Oh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

362
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,976
You're telling me Jews
don't pray, honey?

363
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,773
– Unless you have some objection.
– No, no, no, no, I'd love to.

364
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,858
Pam, come on, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.

365
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:47,403
I've said grace at many a dinner table.

366
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,077
Let's…

367
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,747
OK.

368
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:04,253
O dear God…

369
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,007
…thank you.

370
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:13,930
You are such a good God to us,
a kind and gentle…

371
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:19,560
…and accommodating God.

372
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:24,899
And we thank you, O sweet,
sweet Lord of hosts…

373
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,943
…for the…

374
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,115
…smorgasbord you have so aptly

375
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,284
lain at our table this day…

376
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,247
…and each day… by day.

377
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,043
Day by day by day.

378
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:50,925
O dear Lord, three things we pray.

379
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,637
To love Thee more dearly,

380
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:59,267
to see Thee more clearly,

381
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,812
to follow Thee more nearly…

382
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:06,983
…day by day… by day.

383
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,651
– Amen.
– Amen.

384
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,320
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

385
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,241
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting, too.

386
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,669
Oh, that's a… That's a lovely vase.
That's great.

387
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:30,590
Let me guess, Jack. Is that
one of your secret cameras, too?

388
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:38,598
Greg, Greg. That's an urn which holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

389
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:43,352
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

390
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,438
That's all right.
You didn't know, Greg.

391
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,691
– I'm…
– That's our gran-gran.

392
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:53,196
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

393
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,698
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

394
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,575
Miss you every day.

395
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,995
Oh, honey, why don't you
read Greg your poem?

396
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,206
Oh, no, he doesn't want to hear that.

397
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,208
What? No! What-what-what poem?

398
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,044
You see, when Jack had to retire

399
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,713
– for health reasons…
– That's a bunch of malarky. I'm fine.

400
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,716
The doctor thought it would be
therapeutic if he

401
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,177
sort of expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

402
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:20,389
Honey, you wrote the most beautiful
poem about your mother.

403
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,391
Please, we really wanna hear it.

404
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,061
– Poem, poem.
– Please!

405
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:29,065
Oh, all right.
It's a work in progress.

406
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,526
I'm still not happy with it.

407
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,903
As soon as it's ready,

408
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,865
then I am going to glaze it
onto a plate

409
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,076
– and put it next to the urn.
– Nice.

410
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,036
It's very special.

411
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:46,415
<i>My Mother</i> by Jack Byrnes.

412
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,920
«You gave me life, you gave me milk

413
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,214
You gave me courage

414
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:59,178
Your name was Angela
the angel from heaven

415
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:03,349
But you were also an angel of God
and he needed you too

416
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,727
Selfishly I tried to keep you here

417
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,438
While the cancer ate away your organs

418
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,774
Like an unstoppable rebel force.

419
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:17,613
But I couldn't save you
and I shall see your face…

420
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,909
Nevermore, nevermore

421
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,787
Nevermore…

422
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:29,125
Until we meet… in heaven»

423
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,795
Daddy, that's beautiful.

424
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,965
– It always gets me.
– Amazing. So…

425
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,720
So much love, yet also
so much information.

426
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,223
It takes a lot out of him.

427
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:50,229
– Greg, would you like some yams?
– Thank you. Oh, yeah.

428
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,566
You must've had vegetables fresher
than that, growing up on a farm, Greg.

429
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:57,320
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

430
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,405
He told me he grew up on a farm.

431
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,536
– Do they have many farms in Detroit?
– No, Dina, no, not a lot.

432
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,580
In fact, Jack, I should clarify this.

433
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:11,834
I didn't actually grow up…
on a farm per se.

434
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:15,463
The house we grew up in
was originally erected

435
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,674
in the early Dutch farm, Colonial style.

436
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:22,428
So that, plus we had a lot of pets…

437
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,225
– Which one did you milk then?
– Dad!

438
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:33,648
– Honey, he said he pumped milk.
– What have you ever milked?

439
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,152
A cat.

440
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,155
A cat?

441
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,698
I milked a cat once.

442
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:46,535
– You wanna hear a story?
– Sure.

443
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:52,208
My sister had a cat, and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.

444
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,294
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was this one little runt…

445
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,547
this little sweet little…
little-engine-that-could runt

446
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,343
who wanted to get up there and couldn't
really get access to the… to the…

447
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,972
…to the… to the… to the teat.

448
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,848
Teat?

449
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,850
– Dad.
– What have you.

450
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:15,398
I went in and just simply,
you know, just…

451
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,904
…into a little saucer,

452
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:26,867
then took the saucer and fed it
to Geppetto… that's what I named him.

453
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,745
I had… I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

454
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,248
Oh, yeah, you can milk
anything with nipples.

455
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,753
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?

456
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,756
OK, could we change
the subject perhaps?

457
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,385
– Champagne, champagne.
– Yes.

458
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,595
Maybe we could celebrate
with a little bubbly.

459
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,265
That'd be great. Good idea.

460
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,942
«I have nipples. Can you milk me?»

461
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,446
Well, in a funny way,
you've already seen Deb's ring.

462
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,740
That's true.

463
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,742
Would anybody care for a bottle

464
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,953
of Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries
finest champagne?

465
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,623
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

466
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,208
That's very nice.

467
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,919
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?
I haven't been home for months.

468
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,797
Well, when I gave Bob
the OK to propose to Deb,

469
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,966
I put him in touch with my diamond guy,

470
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,761
and he picked out
the same design Kevin gave you.

471
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,724
– Kevin, your old boyfriend?
– Thanks, Dad.

472
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:34,143
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fiance.

473
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:45,446
Oh, my God. Jinxy, no!

474
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,490
Jinxy, no!

475
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,700
Oh, God.

476
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:51,952
Shit.

477
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,999
– Greg, sweetie, how you doing?
– Oh, just fine,

478
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,336
considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,

479
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:04,548
found out you were engaged and
had your father ask me to milk him.

480
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,926
At least back then he was
still talking to me.

481
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,595
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were that close.

482
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,681
– Who, Daddy and me?
– No, Kevin and you.

483
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,683
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?

484
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,522
You never told me about
your cat-milking days in Motown.

485
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,440
That was a long time ago, Pam.

486
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,734
Yeah, OK, well, so was this.

487
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:29,698
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical than anything else.

488
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,953
Physical? Like what?
Like you worked out together?

489
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,542
No, no, it was nothing, nothing.
It was a stupid sexual thing.

490
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,836
I'm gonna go throw up now.

491
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,673
Greg, listen. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month

492
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,967
before I realized
that I'd made a mistake, OK?

493
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,928
I… I… I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,

494
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:54,557
and I met and fell in love with you,
OK, so can we please drop this?

495
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,727
– OK.
– Good.

496
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,938
I just feel like this is
not going well at all.

497
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:04,400
– I feel like your dad hates me.
– He doesn't hate you, sweetie.

498
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,278
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?

499
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,280
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

500
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:13,868
I thought he would love my gift,
you know, being this big flower guy,

501
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:17,246
but it's like he didn't even show
the slightest bit of interest.

502
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:21,250
Listen to me. Forget the gift.

503
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:25,921
You are the most adorable, loving,
sweetest man in the whole world,

504
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,424
and I love you.

505
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,926
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that,

506
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,930
and grow to love you too, OK? OK?

507
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,269
Speaking of growing to love you…

508
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,605
– Honey, it's late. Come on.
– I know it's late.

509
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,858
But Mr. Winky is still on Chicago time,

510
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,278
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.

511
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,821
Greg?

512
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,617
And there it is.

513
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,372
What's with the robe?

514
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,126
It's Pam's. My pajamas are in
the suitcase with everything else.

515
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,754
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

516
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,464
– OK, honey?
– Sure.

517
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,299
– You don't have to do that, Dina.
– Oh, no, no.

518
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,134
No, that's fine. We have to.

519
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,970
– Thank you.
– You're welcome.

520
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:18,515
Look, Greg, I just wanna say, don't
worry about what happened tonight.

521
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:23,520
Oh, well, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible. I mean…

522
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,398
Well, it was a horrible thing.

523
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:34,156
But let's just put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

524
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,744
– OK. OK.
– Thank you, Daddy.

525
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,164
– Oh, thank you.
– Thanks, Mom.

526
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,999
– These'll do just fine.
– Good night.

527
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,502
Night-night. Why'd you give him
my favorite pair?

528
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,463
– Good night. See you in the morning.
– Good night.

529
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,007
– Have a nice sleep.
– OK, you too.

530
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:56,845
Oh, no, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

531
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:01,850
Oh, OK, 'cause Pam said
I should sleep in Debbie's room.

532
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,145
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.

533
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,439
This way, you'll have more privacy,
you'll have your own bathroom.

534
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,193
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's always a little quirky.

535
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,030
– OK.
– Oh, one more thing.

536
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,618
I'm a realist. I understand
it's the 21st century,

537
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:23,706
and you've probably had premarital
relations with my daughter.

538
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,376
But under our roof, it's my way
or the Long Island Expressway.

539
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,713
– Is that understood?
– Of course, yeah.

540
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,882
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

541
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,094
OK.

542
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,060
<i>Welcome to Atlantic American Airways'
lost luggage department.</i>

543
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,897
<i>At Atlantic American Airways, customer
satisfaction always comes first.</i>

544
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,108
<i>We are experiencing heavy call volume.</i>

545
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,235
<i>Because your call
is very important to us,</i>

546
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,405

547
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,575
<i>Please press «1» if you'd like

548
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,536
<i>We are closed for the night.
Please call back…</i>

549
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,085
Sorry.

550
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:16,592
I don't know what it is, but there's
something about him that's a little off.

551
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,428
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jack,
you know we've been through this

552
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:24,475
with every boyfriend Pam has had
since, what, middle school.

553
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,604
I think Greg…
He's a lovely young man.

554
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:31,774
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.

555
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,903
She said that?
She said those exact words?

556
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,114
I didn't tape record it, Jack,
but that's the impression.

557
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,369
I just feel sorry, the poor boy
never had a home-cooked meal.

558
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,289
What kind of a family doesn't have time
to sit down for dinner?

559
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:51,293
– Fugitives.
– Please try to enjoy the weekend.

560
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,963
– Both our daughters are in love.
– That's what I'm worried about.

561
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,637
– Oh, geez, I just realized something.
– What?

562
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,181
– Pam's middle name.
– Martha.

563
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,142
Oh, no.

564
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,852
Pamela Martha Focker.

565
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,206
«Operation Ko Samui»?

566
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,259
Looking for something, Greg?

567
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,555
Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

568
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:30,559
I heard a noise, so I came down
to see if everything was OK.

569
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,477
Everything's fine.
I just… I'm sorry.

570
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,438
I saw a light on,
and I kinda stumbled in.

571
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,858
– I didn't realize…
– That's OK. See anything interesting?

572
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:41,403
No, not at all. I mean, I mean…

573
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,033
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this… It's a cozy little nook.

574
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,410
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.

575
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,749
– Yeah.
– It's an antique polygraph machine.

576
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,585
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,

577
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,712
but I never saw one actually up close.

578
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,714
You know what?

579
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,218
Why don't you try that on?

580
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,929
Oh, that's OK.

581
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,057
Oh, come on. We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.

582
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,726
– I… I shouldn't.
– Why should you be afraid?

583
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,770
– You have nothing to hide.
– No, I know.

584
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,773
– So there shouldn't be any problem.
– No, there's no problem.

585
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,485
– So, try it on.
– OK.

586
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,153
I'll help you.

587
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,455
Don't worry. You'll enjoy this.

588
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,876
All right.

589
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:43,298
Looks complicated. Now, these aren't
100 percent accurate, right? They're…

590
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,134
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

591
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,804
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.

592
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,266
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions,

593
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,643
and all you have to do
is answer «yes» or «no.»

594
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,147
– OK.
– All right. Let's give it a whirl.

595
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:04,361
– Did you fly on an airplane today?
– Yes, I did.

596
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,115
No peeking. Did we eat pot roast

597
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:11,827
– for dinner tonight?
– Yes.

598
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,912
Was it under-cooked?

599
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:22,170
No, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste.

600
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,633
– But I wouldn't…
– I'm just kidding, I'm just…

601
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,306
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.

602
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,644
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

603
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,943
No.

604
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,698
– I mean, well, I don't…
– Yes or no?

605
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:02,753
– Hey!
– Hey.

606
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,383
What's the matter? You can't sleep?

607
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,969
No, no, I'm just going over
some of my answers

608
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,221
from the polygraph test
your dad just gave me.

609
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,016
– Oh, no, he didn't.
– Yeah, he did.

610
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,393
Well, did you lie to him?

611
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,688
No! I mean… Well, he asked me
if we were living together,

612
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,274
– and…
– What'd you tell him?

613
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,360
I… nothing.
Your mother walked in

614
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,570
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.

615
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,697
This how you'd react if I told you

616
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,908
he shoved bamboo shoots
up my fingernails?

617
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:37,329
Or does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?

618
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,665
Well, he doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

619
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,417
What?

620
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,420
Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.

621
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,423
That was just his cover.

622
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,426
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

623
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,513
How could you not tell me this?

624
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:59,101
I wanted to, honey, but it was strictly
on a «need-to-know» basis.

625
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,607
So, what? He's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy?

626
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:08,110
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.

627
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,321
They used him to interrogate suspected
double agents in the company.

628
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,323
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

629
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,992
I was scared of your dad back
when I thought he was a florist.

630
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,287
It's wonderful to know I've actually got
a CIA spy-hunter on my ass.

631
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:23,291
Would you stop?
You're doing great, OK?

632
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,461
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

633
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,632
– It's just weird.
– Oh, I know, but you're doing fine.

634
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,677
I promise.

635
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,853
– No, no!
– What's wrong, sweetie?

636
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,481
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out of my cage.

637
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,984
– Your what?
– I told your dad

638
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,485
I wouldn't touch you for 72 hours.

639
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,655
– I'm not in junior high anymore, so…
– No, no, no.

640
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,742
Seriously. I want to try
to respect his rules, OK?

641
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,453
OK. Fine.

642
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,665
Why don't you go ahead and get some
sleep, and I'll see you in the morning.

643
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,208
OK.

644
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:20,515
– Morning, Greg.
– Good morning.

645
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,686
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret of mine last night.

646
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,564
Yes, she did.

647
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,401
As long as you can keep your
mouth shut for the rest of your life,

648
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,987
you're in no immediate danger.

649
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,741
I won't tell.

650
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,869
I'm just being humorous.

651
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,914
That was funny.

652
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,710
But the fact is, Greg, with
the knowledge you've been given,

653
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:51,880
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

654
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,842
«the Byrnes family circle of trust.»

655
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,803
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me,

656
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,893
– and round and round we go.
– OK. Understood.

657
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,565
OK, good. Come on.
Let's go inside and have breakfast.

658
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,533
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
Where are you</i>

659
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>I love you</i>

660
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,081
Jinxy. Jinxy.

661
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,416
Not at the table, honey, please.

662
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:32,921
– Attaboy!
– Hey, hey, look who's up!

663
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,589
– Hi, sweetie.
– You must be Greg.

664
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,133
– Hello.
– Oh, look, somebody had

665
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,427
a visit from the hair fairy.

666
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,265
– Oh, yes.
– Nice 'do, nice 'do.

667
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,600
I'll do the intros.
Greg, this is my sister, Debbie.

668
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,228
– Hi. Nice to meet you.
– The bride-to-be. Congratulations.

669
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:52,274
– And her fiance, Dr. Bob.
– You can call me Bob… M.D.

670
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:56,152
– These are his parents, Linda Banks…
– Hi. How are you?

671
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,614
…and the world-famous
plastic surgeon, Dr. Larry.

672
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,950
Whoa, now, cut that out.

673
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,662
You know, Greg's
in medicine, too, Larry.

674
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:08,665
– Oh, really? What field?
– Nursing.

675
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,795
– That's good.
– No, really. What field?

676
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,631
Nursing.

677
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:23,138
Hey, why don't I get you
a chair, Greg?

678
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,682
Thank you. Thanks.

679
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,685
So, you didn't want
to go for the M.D.?

680
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,814
No, I actually thought about becoming a
doctor, but I decided it wasn't for me.

681
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,816
Just as well. Boards are killer.

682
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,652
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

683
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,988
– You serious?
– No, I did OK.

684
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,324
Oh, he did more than OK. Trust me.

685
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,452
Why did you take the test if you weren't
planning on going to med school?

686
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,579
Well, I wanted to keep my options open,

687
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,706
but in the end,
nursing was a better fit for me.

688
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,667
It gives you the freedom to work
in several different areas of medicine.

689
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,794
Plus, I can focus
100 percent on patient care,

690
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,297
as opposed to being a doctor where
you have to deal with the bureaucracy.

691
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:00,133
Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

692
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,135
Oh, my God!
I thought Deb told you.

693
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,847
Dr. Andy threw out his back.
He can't make the wedding.

694
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:09,059
Oh, damn. Now I have
to reconfigure the whole procession.

695
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:13,980
Bob, why doesn't Greg stand in
for Andy, be the usher?

696
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,192
– No, Pam, no.
– That'll be fine.

697
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,319
Bob, Greg'll be your second usher.

698
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:23,406
– Good.
– Yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK, sure.

699
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:27,202
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go

700
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,788
because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.

701
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:30,955
Thirty-two minutes!

702
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,000
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

703
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,878
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.

704
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,051
Dina, thank you so much
for breakfast.

705
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,225
– Hey, you OK?
– Why didn't you wake me up?

706
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,185
I thought you'd like to sleep late.

707
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,187
Not when I'm a guest
in somebody's house.

708
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,648
– It's OK. Don't worry about it.
– No, it's not OK.

709
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,818
Tell that to Dr. Torquemada
in there with the grand inquisition.

710
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:02,404
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.

711
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,782
– Get dressed in what?
– Borrow some more of dad's clothes.

712
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,451
– No, I don't… come on.
– Why not, honey?

713
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:12,288
I just… No, I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

714
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,250
OK, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

715
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,252
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met,

716
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,462
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?

717
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,924
OK, all right.

718
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,760
– Where's Denny's room?
– Top of the stairs, turn right.

719
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,226
Denny?

720
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,940
Denny?

721
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,276
Denny?

722
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,280
Hello? Hello?

723
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,337
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell you doing in here?

724
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,798
I'm… I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

725
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,009
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?

726
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:10,138
No, dude, no. No, no,
she said I could come up here,

727
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:12,265
– maybe borrow some clothes from you.
– Do me a favor. Close the door.

728
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,267
– OK.
– Quick.

729
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,481
– Tell anybody I wasn't here?
– No, they think you're asleep.

730
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:23,151
– Yeah, so, it's all good.
– You scared me.

731
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,328
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?

732
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:35,288
No, it's not that bad.

733
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:38,249
Your little Pamcake's got it
a lot worse than I do, you know?

734
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,960
You need some clothes.

735
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,421
Yes, that would be…
That would be great.

736
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,591
– Glad to hook you up. All right?
– Cool.

737
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,719
Like what you done with the crib.

738
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:55,016
Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

739
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:01,815
P-h phat.

740
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,900
I think these oughta do it.
Here you go, chief.

741
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,902
– All right!
– Enjoy!

742
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,029
– Thanks a lot, Denny.
– No problem.

743
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,991
Oh, and don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?

744
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,160
– I'll keep it on the lowdown.
– Down low.

745
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,537
No doubt.

746
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,708
People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.

747
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:25,046
Larry, Linda, Debbie, Bob, honey.

748
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:29,217
Now, I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

749
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,427
– I don't think I need a jacket.
– It's cold out, honey.

750
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,722
Hold on. Here, take Denny's jacket.

751
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:41,187
– Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.
– Whatever.

752
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,566
– Let's go.
– Hurry, hurry. We're going to be late.

753
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,484
– Who is ready for the tux shop?
– Oh, fuck…

754
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,913
Denny, how's the tux fit?

755
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,958
– Dad…
– What's that?

756
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,711
It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

757
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:11,259
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device for smoking marijuana.

758
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,387
Really?

759
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,434
Not mine. It's not.

760
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:24,230
Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?

761
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:31,946
– I like the top hat. Complements you.
– Can I talk to you for a minute?

762
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,953
Sit down.

763
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,836
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust to you, Greg?

764
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,714
Yeah, I think I got it.

765
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,425
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?

766
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,928
I… I don't think so.

767
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:58,348
Didn't we have a discussion
yesterday in the car about this?

768
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,643
Oh, yes! You mean… yes!

769
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,895
You mean me and Pam. Yes,
I'd love to talk to you about that.

770
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,356
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.

771
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:09,984
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice,

772
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,986
but to put you right back
outside the circle.

773
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,156
And once you're out, you're out.
There's no coming back.

774
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,161
Well, I would definitely like
to stay inside the circle.

775
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,455
Well, then, tell me the truth.

776
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,540
OK.

777
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:31,047
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

778
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,801
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.

779
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:38,346
That's what 19 months in a
Vietnamese prison camp will do to you.

780
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:42,350
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.

781
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:46,771
And if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

782
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,815
I will bring you down, baby.

783
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:51,526
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

784
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:09,335
Where are we? I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

785
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:12,839
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

786
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:14,424
Wow!

787
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,760
– Oh, this is a crazy house.
– Not bad, huh, Dad?

788
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:23,558
Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal
purposes. People do that nowadays.

789
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:26,311
This kid has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.

790
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,521
Hey, you. Get in some
quality time with the boys?

791
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,606
Yeah, it was fun.

792
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,235
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

793
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:38,281
Why would «B.B.Q.
at best man's» be weird?

794
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:41,576
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.

795
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:44,454
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

796
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,583
– Kevin, your ex-fiance?
– Hey! Welcome, everybody.

797
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,918
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?

798
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:58,468
Well, they… they went
to lacrosse camp together,

799
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,596
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

800
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:03,765
Lacrosse camp?

801
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,934
I was really lucky
I was able to salvage this wood

802
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,312
from an old seamen's chapel
in Nantucket.

803
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,608
– Wow! Kevin, the house is amazing.
– This is where the light comes in.

804
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,610
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.

805
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,821
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot and the pool is luke.

806
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,074
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B.B.Q,

807
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,326
– just follow me.
– All right, Kevo.

808
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,161
– Right on schedule.
– Bring it on.

809
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:27,330
It must cost a fortune
to heat this place.

810
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:29,123
Wait till you see the rest of the house.

811
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,959
OK. This way, everybody, out this way.

812
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,393
– You OK, sweetie?
– Yeah.

813
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,979
I'm really sorry. I don't know
why I thought you knew.

814
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,981
It… It's not a big deal.

815
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,651
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

816
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,321
I think I can handle an afternoon
with your ex-fiance.

817
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,989
OK. Thank you.

818
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:06,160
Now, for the floor that you're walking
on, I chose this Bolivian wormwood.

819
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,747
I think it works well in here.
I have the Viking range here,

820
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,834
and the twin sub-z's.
Yeah, they open up right there.

821
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,710
Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

822
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,296
– Yeah, kind of blend in.
– Great.

823
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:22,009
– Are you a homeowner, Greg?
– No, no, I rent.

824
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:26,848
So, things are going real, real well
for you at Neuberger, aren't they, Kevo?

825
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,767
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.

826
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:33,604
I got in early on some wireless IPOs.
The stuff just skyrocketed from there.

827
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,856
Wow.

828
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,191
What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?

829
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,902
– I'm in health care.
– So you know what I'm talking about.

830
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,780
There are a lot of Benjamins
to be made now with biotech stuff.

831
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:45,408
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?

832
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:47,994
I'd say strong…

833
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:51,622
…to quite strong.

834
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,791
You gotta strike while the iron's hot.

835
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,835
Now's the time.

836
00:54:56,002 --> 00:55:00,214
– Greg's a male nurse.
– That's right. Thank you, Jack.

837
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:04,719
Well, that's great. That's great
to give something back like that.

838
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:06,762
I'd love to find time to do
volunteer work.

839
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,473
Just the other day I saw
this golden retriever that…

840
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:11,601
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really…

841
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,228
It made me feel terrible. I wish
there was something I could do.

842
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:17,940
Yeah, well, I get paid, but also
it feels, you know, good, too.

843
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,276
So it's kind of… everybody wins.

844
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:23,070
What are you…
You're like a Wall Street trader?

845
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,697
– An investment guy?
– No.

846
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:28,618
I mean, I don't like to be painted
with that brush. Yes, that's my day job.

847
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,079
We have time?
We got time, don't we, Jack?

848
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,291
I want to show you what I'm really
interested in. Come on. Let's go.

849
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:42,256
Wow! It looks like somebody
got an «A» in wood shop.

850
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:48,262
Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby.
I whittled that out of beech wood.

851
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,431
– It's beautiful.
– Yeah.

852
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:53,226
– What got you into… «carpentering»?
– Carpentry?

853
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:57,939
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.
He was a carpenter.

854
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,775
I figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,

855
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,610
who better than Christ?

856
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,158
Greg's Jewish.

857
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,452
– Are you?
– Yeah.

858
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,123
Well, so was J.C.
Wow. You're in good company.

859
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,751
Right.

860
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,630
Well, I'm gonna head to the pool,

861
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,799
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

862
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,427
– Wow, he made a gift.
– Greg.

863
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,972
I put a fresh coat of lacquer
on this this morning,

864
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,890
so bear with me with the fumes.

865
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:38,271
Wow. Kev.

866
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,940
– Isn't that something?
– That's incredible.

867
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,693
– Thank you.
– Roses. Deb's favorite.

868
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,570
– Yes, right.
– The little holes are for candles.

869
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,990
Exactly. And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.

870
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,660
– They make a tiny birdbath.
– That's great.

871
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,871
It's beautiful. What is it?

872
00:56:56,038 --> 00:57:00,585
It's an altar.
Or you might call it a chuppah.

873
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,131
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

874
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,508
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',

875
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,011
and tomorrow Robert and Debra
will meet beneath it

876
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,931
to become man and wife. And later,
when they purchase a home,

877
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,017
maybe it will grace their garden.

878
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:20,604
Well, that's my sappy, romantic idea.

879
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,151
Must have taken forever to build.

880
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,903
No, not too bad. About 70 hours.

881
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,866
Which isn't bad, considering I carved it
all by hand from one piece of wood.

882
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,039
<i>Hey, Kevo. 12:15. Time to start
the barbecue, big guy.</i>

883
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,334
OK, Mr. B.
I better get back to playing host.

884
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,004
OK, you guys, grab your suits,
and I'll meet you down at the pool.

885
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:47,006
I'm gonna take a pass on the swimming.

886
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,507
Oh, no, you can't.

887
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,260
I don't even have a suit with me.
The airline lost my bag…

888
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,888
<i>Pamcake, let's go.
Mom's got your suit here.</i>

889
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:57,058
– Coming, Dad.
– You better get going.

890
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,103
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.

891
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:06,275
Thank you. And, by the way, she just
had the nicest things to say about you.

892
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,153
– Really?
– Yeah.

893
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:15,368
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.

894
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,204
Boy, she is a tomcat.

895
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,586
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.

896
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:28,631
– I'm not gonna swim.
– I'm not taking no for an answer.

897
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,427
Cold buffet is on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

898
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,971
Comin' through here.

899
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:51,779
Yeah, that'd be Gre…
Hey, there he is! Get out here.

900
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,117
G-man, we got salmon, we got
swordfish. What's it gonna be?

901
00:58:56,283 --> 00:59:01,789
How 'bout a little of both, K-Dog?
I'm pretty hungry.

902
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,625
I think they call that the munchies.

903
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,255
Let's go. Hit the ball, Kev!
Show 'em what you got!

904
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,558
– Come on, Greg.
– Damn!

905
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,476
– He's got nothing.
– Come on, Greg.

906
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,146
– Service.
– Come on, Greg.

907
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:30,317
– Nice serve, pal.
– All right.

908
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:31,694
Bring it on, Jack.

909
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:37,700
– Set it!
– Oh, Greg! Come on!

910
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:40,870
– Nice shot, Maverick!
– Sweet setup, Iceman.

911
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,331
– Nice one, nurse.
– Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

912
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,667
You gotta rush the net on defense.
Don't be afraid of the ball.

913
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,462
– It's Greg.
– Huddle up, team. Huddle up.

914
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,839
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid of the ball.

915
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:54,842
– Come on. This is unacceptable.
– He's gotta go for the ball.

916
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,512
– Here's what we gotta do.
– Let's go! We're gettin' cold in here.

917
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,055
We're gettin' creamed, people.

918
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,516
If Florence Nightingale
would play defense.

919
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,561
– Larry, I missed one shot.
– It was a big shot.

920
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:09,231
Larry, keep floatin' where you are.
Denny, take the deep shots.

921
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,359
Greg, nobody's expecting much out
of you. If I set you up with the ball,

922
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,653
– can you jump up and spike it?
– No.

923
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,158
– I'd have to be pretty high, but yeah.
– I bet you would, Panama Red.

924
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,744
– Everybody, look sharp. Break!
– Let's play some ball.

925
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:24,497
– All right, here we go.
– Come on!

926
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,167
– Let's go.
– Come on.

927
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:32,046
– Greg!
– Set!

928
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:35,382
You gotta spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!

929
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:38,177
– Look how Bob did that. Nice play, Bob.
– Thanks, Jack.

930
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:41,472
– Fire it up there, Focker!
– Let's do it!

931
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,099
– Way to go, Deb!
– Greg!

932
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,231
Honey! God!

933
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:58,239
– What the hell's the matter with you?
– It's only a game, Focker!

934
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,741
Oh, honey! I'm coming!

935
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,619
Get some ice.

936
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:07,498
– My eye! Oh, my eye!
– Focker!

937
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,959
God!

938
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,589
– Pam, help your sister, please.
– I'm so sorry, Deb.

939
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,051
Deb, you can totally see Voit
backwards on your forehead.

940
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:21,595
– Denny, get outta here!
– You the bandleader?

941
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,181
Go over the song selection
with Bob. Bob? Bob!

942
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,934
– Yeah, Jack.
– Are you a Mr. Focker?

943
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:29,770
– Yes.
– OK. Sign here, please.

944
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,189
– Great. Thank you.
– I'm sorry, honey.

945
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,618
Hey, your suitcase. You go through it,
make sure it's all there?

946
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:47,121
– Yeah, it's fine. What's up?
– Good.

947
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,876
Wanted to make sure you're OK
since hitting the spike

948
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,210
heard 'round the world.

949
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,130
– Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
– It's OK.

950
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:59,091
I don't know what got into me, Iceman.

951
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,426
«Iceman»?

952
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:02,970
I'm sorry. That a special thing
between you and Kevin?

953
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,556
– Oh, Greg, stop it.
– Stop what, Iceman?

954
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:08,350
<i>Top Gun</i> was a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.

955
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:12,313
– All right? That's it.
– Iceman. I have no problem with that.

956
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,816
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what this is all about?

957
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:21,280
– I can't be Maverick. Kevin's Maverick.
– He used to be, but we can change that.

958
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:25,326
– Can he be Goose?
– No, because Goose dies in the end.

959
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:27,995
It's very sad.

960
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,541
– Honey, I don't really…
– Greg, shut up.

961
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,168
OK.

962
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:49,266
– Dad, you ever think of knocking?
– Not in my own den.

963
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:53,187
– What are you two doing in here?
– I'd say rounding second base.

964
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:59,193
– This is Greg's room, Dad.
– We're gonna use it for storage.

965
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,488
Greg will stay in Debbie's room,
and she'll bunk up with you tonight.

966
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,531
Fine. Come on, Greg.

967
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:05,908
OK. I'll be right up.

968
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:07,743
I'll meet you upstairs.

969
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,330
– Oh, good. They found your suitcase.
– Yeah.

970
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:15,542
Hey, Jack, I don't quite know
what happened back at the tux shop.

971
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:19,254
If I've given you the wrong impression
regarding Pam in any way, I'm sorry.

972
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:24,259
OK? I have nothing but the best
intentions with Pam, and I just…

973
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:27,388
There's something in the suitcase here
that I'm planning on giving her

974
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,682
that I think symbolizes…

975
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:35,604
…the level of my commitment to her.

976
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:41,276
And I wouldn't feel right asking her to
wear it without her father's permission.

977
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,906
– Jack?
– Did you flush this toilet?

978
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:50,327
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

979
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,454
I saw little Jinxy come in last night,

980
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,374
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.

981
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:59,169
Jinx knows not to use that toilet,
and even if he did, he'd never flush it.

982
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,256
– What does it matter?
– The matter, Greg, R.N.,

983
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,758
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,

984
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:08,387
and when you have a septic tank nearly
full and a toilet running all night,

985
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,389
then you could have a hell of a problem.

986
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,599
Mr. Byrnes?

987
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,394
This was not part of my job description.

988
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,771
Nice stench. You're really
on a roll there, bud.

989
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,773
Bite me, Denny!

990
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,234
Listen to me. In 20 hours,
I'm having a wedding here,

991
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,236
so I need my cesspool pumped now!

992
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:27,740
– Not tomorrow. Now!
– Dad, what's going on?

993
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,076
– Oh, my God!
– What's that smell?

994
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:33,287
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

995
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:36,290
Focker flushed the toilet in the den,
so the septic tank is overflowing.

996
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:39,042
Jack, I told you. It wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

997
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:41,462
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!

998
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,465
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for chrissakes!

999
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,468
The animal doesn't
even have thumbs, Focker.

1000
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,680
– Hey, look at this!
– Kevo!

1001
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:53,974
Over by the tree, right?

1002
01:04:57,186 --> 01:04:59,313
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!

1003
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,900
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!

1004
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,360
– Kevin, no!
– No, no, no, no!

1005
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:14,536
– No, no, no!
– What the heck?

1006
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,223
I know that's what I said I wanted,
that's what I wanted.

1007
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,266
It is a black Samsonite suitcase.

1008
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:38,352
What I'm saying is,
do you think it's possible

1009
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:40,813
that the Samsonite people,
in some crazy little scheme

1010
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,857
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?

1011
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:45,776
<i>– I don't think so.</i>
– Really, you don't?

1012
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,320
<i>I am going to need your
baggage claim number again.</i>

1013
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:49,488
Jinx, stop.

1014
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:41,039
– I know I signed for it.
<i>– I'm looking at your signature.</i>

1015
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,333
Do me a favor.
Could I talk to your supervisor?

1016
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,586
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1017
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,962
– What's your name?
<i>– Joy.</i>

1018
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:50,757
– Let me talk to your supervisor.
<i>– My supervisor is on a break.</i>

1019
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,427
When he gets back, have him
give me a call right away.

1020
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,429
– It's a very important bag.
<i>– I'm sure it is, sir.</i>

1021
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:03,437
Jinx.

1022
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:06,565
Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.

1023
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:09,401
Please, I'm in a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.

1024
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,486
<i>– So the name's «Greg Focker»?</i>
– I don't know.

1025
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,280
Greg or Gregory. Run both names.

1026
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,658
Jinx.

1027
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,285
Come on. No. Jinx.

1028
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:19,786
Come here. Jinxy.

1029
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,123
Mew, mew, mew. No. No.

1030
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,626
Jinx. Oh, shit.

1031
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,295
Greg didn't ace his med school boards.

1032
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,005
He never even took
the goddamn MCATs.

1033
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:34,134
Oh, Jack, that's what you
had your sources check out?

1034
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,803
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

1035
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,348
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.

1036
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,850
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers

1037
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,769
looking for easy access to ludes.

1038
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:46,605
We already know that he's been
puffin' the magic dragon.

1039
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:49,024
I knew the little quack was lying.

1040
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:54,154
Jinxy. Come here.
Come here, little Jinxy head.

1041
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:03,997
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
I won't hurt you</i>

1042
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:12,589
– The fact is, Greg lied to you.
– He did not lie to me, Dad.

1043
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,675
He lied to you, and I thought
you should know the truth.

1044
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,052
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.

1045
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,680
I don't care what
your information says, Dad.

1046
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,266
Greg took the MCATs. OK?

1047
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,247
Holy…

1048
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,125
Shit!

1049
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,309
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1050
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:53,774
No!

1051
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:03,742
Holy…

1052
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,286
– No!
– Oh, my God!

1053
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,455
All right, everybody.
All right, stand back.

1054
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,874
Stay back. Stay back.

1055
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:15,128
– Watch out. Watch out!
– Oh, Jack! Oh, God!

1056
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,968
We've got a fire! Somebody call 911
right away! Hurry up!

1057
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,726
Jinxy! Jinxy!

1058
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,146
We've checked every yard, every car
on the street. Nobody's seen him.

1059
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,232
He's not up in any
of the trees, Jack.

1060
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,317
We checked all the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.

1061
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,903
Yeah, none of the neighbors
have seen him either.

1062
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:43,198
You tried to milk him, didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!

1063
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:45,325
Dad, stop it. That's enough.

1064
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:48,078
– Honey, please calm down.
– How can I calm down

1065
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:50,080
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal

1066
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,289
and the ring bearer's missing?

1067
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:54,459
– What do you mean, «the ring bearer»?
– Your daddy didn't tell you?

1068
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:57,671
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.

1069
01:10:57,838 --> 01:10:59,714
Oh, no. No, you didn't, Dad.

1070
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,508
Yeah, yeah. You put
this around the neck,

1071
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,218
and these ribbons are for the rings.

1072
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:06,513
– That's adorable, Jack.
– Oh, for chrissakes!

1073
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,806
That's great, Dad.

1074
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:09,558
Yeah, but now we have
to postpone the rehearsal.

1075
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,477
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.

1076
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:14,855
We're gonna canvass the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.

1077
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,024
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.

1078
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,192
– Jack!
– No!

1079
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,903
We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat!

1080
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:26,199
Stupid cat? How could you say that?
That cat's been like a brother to you!

1081
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:30,704
We're supposed to let him wander the
streets without food, water or toilet?

1082
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,000
– Dad, Greg'll find him.
– What?

1083
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:38,003
– Yeah, what?
– Oh, that's wonderful.

1084
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:43,466
Fine. Fine. OK. Denny?

1085
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,760
– Denny? Denny? Denny!
– Dad, I'm right here.

1086
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,805
OK. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.

1087
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,516
I'm not wearin' that stupid
pillow thing on my head.

1088
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,935
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1089
01:11:55,437 --> 01:12:00,358
Jinx! Jinx! Here, Jinx.

1090
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:05,572
You just go and wander the streets
without food, water or toilet? Fucker!

1091
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:10,160
Actually, you may be in luck.

1092
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,246
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

1093
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:15,540
There he is.

1094
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,668
Holy shit, that's Jinx.

1095
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,796
– Jinxy!
– No, let me see that photo again.

1096
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,216
You gotta picture him
without that stupid Santa cap.

1097
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:28,261
– Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!
– No.

1098
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:32,182
You see, in the picture,
your cat has an all-black tail.

1099
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:35,268
– Yeah.
– And this one has a white tip.

1100
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,854
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

1101
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,275
– Looks just like him.
– Almost.

1102
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,654
Except for that tail.

1103
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,250
Dearly beloved…

1104
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:06,800
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here on this beautiful day

1105
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,135
to join Dr. Robert Banks…

1106
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:17,352
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here on this beautiful day

1107
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:22,148
to join Dr. Robert Banks and
Debra Byrnes in holy matrimony.

1108
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,651
This is a special day…

1109
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:51,177
He found him!

1110
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,014
It's him! It's him!

1111
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,017
I gotta see this.

1112
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,397
– Look, Dad, it's Jinx.
– Oh, my little baby!

1113
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:06,818
– We found you. We found you.
– Greg, thank you so much.

1114
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,904
– Where did you find him?
– Gave us a little scare, huh?

1115
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:12,824
Jinxy.

1116
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:31,551
To Greg.

1117
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:34,763
– Honey, where is Greg, anyway?
– He's in the restroom.

1118
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,767
Yes, I tried there. I've tried
every shelter on the north shore, OK?

1119
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:43,521
He's a brown-and-black Himalayan
with an all-black tail.

1120
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:48,526
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, OK.
You go check. I'll call you back.

1121
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,907
– Hey, hey! It's the man of the hour.
– Hey!

1122
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,951
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a little visit to the urinal fairy.

1123
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:05,543
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

1124
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,421
Thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad I could help out.

1125
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,424
We never did get to finish
that little «convo» back in the den.

1126
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:14,719
When you have a minute, there is still
something I'd love to talk to you about.

1127
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,972
We'll get right to it as soon
as we get back. You have my word.

1128
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,642
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of trust.

1129
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:23,812
Guess who's back in the circle of trust.

1130
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:51,798
Look at Jack!

1131
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:56,428
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1132
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:59,806
Maybe I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

1133
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:03,977
Sure. I bet he could whittle a private
little dance floor for the two of you.

1134
01:16:04,144 --> 01:16:06,104
I'm serious.

1135
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,857
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.

1136
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:13,486
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.

1137
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,530
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but…

1138
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:18,199
Come on. Seriously. Seriously.

1139
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,493
Part of you wishes
you ended up with him.

1140
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,665
Yes, he's very talented,
but it would've never worked out.

1141
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,667
Why not?

1142
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:30,670
I was never in love with Kevin.

1143
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,342
I'm in love with you.

1144
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,513
– That's a good explanation.
– Think so?

1145
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,307
Thought you'd like that.

1146
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:44,684
– I do.
– I'm glad.

1147
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:50,857
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like half an hour ago.

1148
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:55,737
OK, I already…
I already described it. Airline.

1149
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:57,864
Messages.

1150
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:01,826
It's, it's brown…

1151
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,706
…with a little bit of black trim.

1152
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,875
Yes.

1153
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,960
<i>Please enter your four-digit code.</i>

1154
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,549
<i>Jack, hi. It's Hank Macatee
from next door.</i>

1155
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:20,011
<i>You'll never guess who wandered
over here this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.</i>

1156
01:17:20,178 --> 01:17:23,264
<i>Yeah, he's not wearing his collar,
but I'm sure it's Jinxy.</i>

1157
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:25,600
<i>Thought you might be worried,
so just give me a jingle</i>

1158
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:28,520
<i>when you guys get home, and
I'll bring the little rascal over.</i>

1159
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,064
OK, well, if you could
just keep checking, please,

1160
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:33,274
and I'll call you back later. Thanks.

1161
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:38,238
– Any luck?
– No, they're still looking.

1162
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,281
Hey, Jack, this is a great party.

1163
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:44,786
I guess sometimes these things come
together in their own kooky sort of way.

1164
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:47,914
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.

1165
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:51,793
– You found him at that animal shelter?
– Yeah, right.

1166
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,463
– The important thing is he's home now.
– Yes.

1167
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:58,258
Yeah. You know, there's something
about that ball of fur

1168
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,468
that just puts a big smile on my face.

1169
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:04,097
Yeah. You haven't seen any
of his latest tricks, have you?

1170
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,266
No.

1171
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,309
Well, when we get back, I'll show you.

1172
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:11,729
We don't have to do it tonight. He's had
a long day. He's probably tired.

1173
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,732
– I wouldn't want to…
– I think he'd like to show you tonight.

1174
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,572
Why don't you give me
the key and let me drive?

1175
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,574
Hey, Larry. You know what?
Why don't I drive?

1176
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,576
– It's a very expensive car.
– Good idea.

1177
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,661
I've always wanted to test-drive a Benz.

1178
01:18:26,828 --> 01:18:28,830
Be my guest, Focker.

1179
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:33,835
– Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?
– Larry said I could drive.

1180
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:41,092
– Let's go. Hurry, hurry. All right.
– Bye, guys.

1181
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:42,969
– See you.
– Thanks for driving.

1182
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:50,685
– Drives better than your Taurus, Greg?
– Yeah.

1183
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:53,313
Come on. Get in the car, honey.
Let's go. Hurry up.

1184
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,523
OK, OK.

1185
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,484
Whoa, nellie!

1186
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,446
Everybody comfortable back there?

1187
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,451
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.

1188
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:11,539
You got your seat belts on back there?
Get your seat belts on.

1189
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,671
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

1190
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,551
– You're driving like a maniac!
– Focker, take it easy!

1191
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:27,013
– Benz drives like a dream, Lar.
– Let's not make it a nightmare, huh?

1192
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:32,185
Oh, there's Jack.

1193
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:37,148
Hey, Jackie.

1194
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:44,864
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

1195
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,244
OK, now, Greg? Greg?

1196
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,748
Greg, no!

1197
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:02,715
– Is everything OK, honey?
– Yeah, just trying to make good time.

1198
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:06,052
What the heck is the matter with you?

1199
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:08,554
All right. We're gonna be home.
We're gonna get home.

1200
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,348
Very soon, we're gonna get home.

1201
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:18,106
It's not the Autobahn.
Come on, Greg!

1202
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:23,778
Jesus!

1203
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:27,198
– Maybe you should drive after all.
– We're OK.

1204
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:34,914
All right.

1205
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,257
Oh, no. No, please.

1206
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,511
– Yes!
– Jack just turned.

1207
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:53,391
You were supposed to make
that left at the light, Focker.

1208
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:56,185
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1209
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,855
Where does he think he's going?

1210
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:02,817
– Home, home, home.
– What a wild ride.

1211
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:05,445
Who gave him the keys?

1212
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,656
– OK, we're out.
– I'm gonna get out on your side, honey.

1213
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:11,826
– I wonder if he has a license.
– Yeah, a license to kill.

1214
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:18,458
Come on, everybody.

1215
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,627
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1216
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,255
You're a lunatic!

1217
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,299
Come on, Linda!

1218
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:27,925
Hey, hey!

1219
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,811
– What in the world…
– Oh, my…

1220
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,147
Oh, the dress!

1221
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,649
It was the cat! Goddamn you!

1222
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,777
– Dad, Dad… Dad! Dad!
– Jinx, I'm gonna…

1223
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,695
Calm down!

1224
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:51,491
– Where's the cat?
– Cat got out! Cat got out, Jack!

1225
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,128
You spray-painted his tail to make him
look like Jinxy, didn't you, Focker?

1226
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:07,006
Greg, what's he talking about?

1227
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:11,344
Hank Macatee called me a couple of
hours ago and told me he found Jinxy.

1228
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,304
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.

1229
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:17,183
He spray-painted his tail, then
tried to beat us back here so that

1230
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,478
– he could get rid of the evidence.
– Oh, no.

1231
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,817
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

1232
01:22:27,485 --> 01:22:31,030
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

1233
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,327
How could you do something like that?

1234
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,831
– I'm sorry.
– What are you going to tell me next?

1235
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,500
That you set Kevin's altar on fire?

1236
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,796
Oh, my God.

1237
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:52,552
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx up onto the roof.

1238
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,888
I had a smoke, and I think
I might have lit something that…

1239
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:02,019
I don't know what happened. He put
so much goddamn lacquer on that thing.

1240
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:07,441
– It was an accident waiting to happen.
– This is very disappointing, Greg.

1241
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:14,115
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1242
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,119
So you lied to me
about everything, Greg?

1243
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:20,913
You lied about the cat,
the fire, about the MCATs.

1244
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,250
I didn't lie about the MCATs.
Don't you see what's happening here?

1245
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:27,753
– Your dad has turned you against me.
– I didn't turn her against you.

1246
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,422
You did that to yourself.

1247
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:34,927
Jack, please. You didn't like me
from the second I walked in here.

1248
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,930
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.

1249
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,767
– All I ask for is honesty.
– Oh, honesty?

1250
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,605
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty, Jack?

1251
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,440
OK, let's talk
a little truth and honesty.

1252
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:52,570
Let's talk a little
«Operation Ko Samui,» Jack.

1253
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:54,614
What's he talking about, Dad?

1254
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,116
Yeah, that's weird, 'cause
I thought there weren't any secrets

1255
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:59,368
inside the circle of trust, Jack.

1256
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,454
I don't know what you're talking about.

1257
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,957
You don't? What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1258
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,752
Hey, Pam, guess what. Daddy's planning

1259
01:24:07,919 --> 01:24:11,130
a little covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.

1260
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,633
You are?

1261
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,760
Round and round we go, Jack. Hey.

1262
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,803
I bet everybody would love
to hear about your rendezvous

1263
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,764
in the parking lot of
the Oyster Bay Drug and Sundrie.

1264
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:22,808
You know what I'm talking about.
Where the guy gave you the passports

1265
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,479
and the documents. Or how about
your little phone call in Thai?

1266
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,981
– Jack can't talk Thai.
– Oh, no, Dina.

1267
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:33,194
Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talk Thai very well.

1268
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,322
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

1269
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:39,742
He's still very much in the CIA.

1270
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:43,996
– Daddy. What…
– He's right.

1271
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:47,833
He's right. My cover's blown.

1272
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,338
I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

1273
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,006
What?

1274
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:56,842
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

1275
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,887
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1276
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,639
What?

1277
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:04,517
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1278
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:08,229
That guy I was meeting in the parking
lot is Thor Svenson, my travel agent.

1279
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:10,356
He was giving me their visas.

1280
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:16,278
Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, J.B.
That's something.

1281
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,572
Don't mention it. I just…

1282
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,617
You know, if this nursing thing
doesn't work out, Focker,

1283
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:24,203
I'd say you definitely have
a career in espionage.

1284
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,667
Thanks, Greg.

1285
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,578
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

1286
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,210
I guess you're gonna stay here.

1287
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,883
Pam, I…

1288
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:53,959
– Gaylord M. Focker?
– Gaylord? Gaylord?

1289
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,128
Yeah, that's me.

1290
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,632
– I thought your name was Greg.
– It is.

1291
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,801
– That's not what it says on the form.
– I know.

1292
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,637
It's my legal name. Nobody's called me
by it since third grade.

1293
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:09,016
Whatever.

1294
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,979
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?

1295
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,904
– Denny.
– I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just…

1296
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:23,489
It's not a normal name.

1297
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:27,535
– Come on. Now look what you've done.
– Oh, Pammy.

1298
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,954
Don't… Don't go away.

1299
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,824
You're in luck. There is room.

1300
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:19,545
And without a Saturday stay-over,
that fare difference will be $1,137.11.

1301
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,719
– Did you want me to book you the seat?
– OK. All right.

1302
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:29,930
Did you want to check any bags today?

1303
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,017
We should be all right with
only one usher, don't you think?

1304
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,646
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1305
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:26,779
Thought you might like to see this.

1306
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:38,624
– How did you get this?
– Oh, I have my sources, too.

1307
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:47,132
I called Gaylord, aka
Greg's parents in Detroit.

1308
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:50,511
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.

1309
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:54,515
Oh, honey. It… That doesn't matter
if he did well on some test.

1310
01:29:54,682 --> 01:29:56,684
What does that prove?
Look at this place!

1311
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,645
He almost destroyed the wedding
because he lied!

1312
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:06,569
I love you, Daddy, but you
can be a real jerk sometimes.

1313
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:14,034
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

1314
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:16,495
Who is, Jack?

1315
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:19,999
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.

1316
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:27,965
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin

1317
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:30,092
until she broke up with him?

1318
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:33,971
Maybe it's time you think about
what Pam wants.

1319
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,195
Greg, it's me.

1320
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,365
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

1321
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:57,077
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.

1322
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:02,708
Listen, I am so sorry.

1323
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:07,671
I acted like a complete idiot,
and I hope that you can forgive me.

1324
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:13,552
I mean, I don't care about
the fire or the cat or…

1325
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:19,558
I mean, I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.

1326
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:23,854
That's actually really gross,
but the point is that…

1327
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:28,400
…that I understand
why you did it, and…

1328
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:32,071
…and I love you. I want you
to know that I really…

1329
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,406
I really, really love you, and…

1330
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:42,748
When you get this,
will you please call me? OK. Bye.

1331
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:51,298
Marty, listen, I need
a commercial flight ID scan.

1332
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:53,675
Interstate from New York
La Guardia to Chicago.

1333
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,053
Four-hour sweeps,
backwards and forwards.

1334
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,765
Last name: Foxtrot, Oscar,
Charlie, Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

1335
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:02,434
First name: Golf,
Alpha, Yankee, Lima…

1336
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:07,314
<i>Gaylord Focker on Atlantic American
flight 27, departs 2:35.</i>

1337
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:10,275
– 2:35? Twenty-three minutes. Thanks.
<i>– Affirmative.</i>

1338
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,570
– Enjoy your flight.
– Thanks.

1339
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:15,280
Hello.

1340
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:20,619
I'm sorry. We're only boarding
rows nine and above right now.

1341
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:24,540
– You'll have to wait.
– Well, I'm in row eight.

1342
01:32:24,707 --> 01:32:26,750
Please step aside, sir.

1343
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:28,919
It's just one row.
Don't you think it's OK if I…

1344
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:30,921
We'll call your row momentarily.

1345
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,134
Step aside, sir.

1346
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:03,036
Thank you for waiting. We'd like to
continue boarding the aircraft now.

1347
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:06,165
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.

1348
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,048
Hello.

1349
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,720
Enjoy your flight.

1350
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:37,696
Excuse me.

1351
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,200
OK, where's the fire, huh?

1352
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:48,582
Will you hand me
a pillow over there?

1353
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:51,376
– You're gonna have to check that.
– I got it.

1354
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,171
– No, I'm sorry. That bag won't fit.
– No, I'm not… hey.

1355
01:33:54,338 --> 01:33:57,049
– I'm not checking my bag, OK?
– There's no need to raise your voice.

1356
01:33:57,216 --> 01:34:00,594
I'm not raising my voice. This would be
raising my voice to you, OK?

1357
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,179
I don't want to check my bag.

1358
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:05,557
By the way, your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

1359
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,601
Because I already did that once,
and you lost it,

1360
01:34:07,768 --> 01:34:09,895
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly for me.

1361
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:12,064
– OK?
– I can assure you that your bag

1362
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:14,066
will be placed safely below deck
with the other luggage.

1363
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:17,778
Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag will
be safe below with the other luggage?

1364
01:34:17,945 --> 01:34:20,447
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?

1365
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:23,158
Gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it in there?

1366
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:26,370
– No.
– No? OK. Then shut your pie hole

1367
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:29,456
and listen to me when I say
that I am finished

1368
01:34:29,623 --> 01:34:32,960
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!

1369
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:36,797
Sir, we have a policy on this airline
that if a bag is this large, we…

1370
01:34:36,964 --> 01:34:39,550
Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, OK?

1371
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:42,844
Not like I have a bomb in here, it's
not like I want to blow up the plane.

1372
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:46,265
I wanna stow my bag according
to your safety regulations.

1373
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:48,475
– Sir, sir…
– If you would take a second

1374
01:34:48,642 --> 01:34:51,645
and take the little sticks out
of your head and clean out your ears,

1375
01:34:51,812 --> 01:34:53,730
maybe you would see that
I'm a person who has feelings,

1376
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:55,816
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!

1377
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:58,861
All I wanna do is hold onto my bag
and not listen to you!

1378
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:01,154
The only way that I would
ever let go of my bag

1379
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:02,823
would be if you came over here now

1380
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:05,158
and tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers.

1381
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:09,288
OK? If you can get it from my kung fu
grip, then you can come and have it.

1382
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:11,832
OK? Otherwise, step off, bitch.

1383
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:16,712
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1384
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,423
– You got him?
– Yeah.

1385
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,348
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended.

1386
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,309
So tow it.

1387
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:32,811
I've got a plane full of people saying
you threatened that stewardess.

1388
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:34,271
I was not threatening her.

1389
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:36,690
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing.

1390
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,359
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her with a bomb!

1391
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:41,612
– I said I didn't have a bomb!
– You said «bomb.»

1392
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,531
– I said, «It's not like I have a bomb.»
– You said «bomb» on an airplane.

1393
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:47,993
– What's wrong with saying «bomb»?
– You can't say «bomb» on an airplane.

1394
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:52,164
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb! You gonna arrest me?

1395
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:55,167
– You assaulted an airline employee…
– What if I was a bombardier?

1396
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:57,210
I got enough to put you away
for a few years!

1397
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,965
Norm. Take five.
I got a specialist here.

1398
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:05,677
Bye, Norm.

1399
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:13,685
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

1400
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:17,856
– I'm everywhere, Focker.
– I didn't do anything, Jack.

1401
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,066
Yeah, I know.

1402
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:21,985
Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1403
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:25,822
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything
until you answer some questions.

1404
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,575
Unless you want to spend the next
years of your life in prison,

1405
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,369
you better goddamn well
tell me the truth.

1406
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:33,664
No more lies. You understand?
No more lies.

1407
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,791
– Did you do this?
– Just answer the questions.

1408
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,126
– Have me taken off that airplane?
– Answer the question.

1409
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:42,214
– Put your hands over there. That's it.
– You're sick, you know that?

1410
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,221
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no?

1411
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:52,391
– Yes.
– Are you a male nurse?

1412
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,559
– Yes.
– Are you a pothead?

1413
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,603
– No.
– Have you ever smoked pot?

1414
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,605
Yes.

1415
01:36:58,772 --> 01:37:01,608
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr. Jinx?

1416
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:03,402
Yes.

1417
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,612
Because you desperately
were seeking my approval?

1418
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:08,615
– Yes.
– Because you love my daughter Pam?

1419
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:11,618
– Yes.
– Do you wanna marry her?

1420
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,622
Do you want to marry her?

1421
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:21,628
I did, until I met you.

1422
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,922
What does that mean?

1423
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:27,384
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.

1424
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,097
But frankly, sir, I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1425
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:34,933
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts

1426
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,811
about whether or not I could
even survive in your family.

1427
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,776
I think you've got some serious issues.

1428
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:49,448
If I lighten up, would you consider
marrying my daughter?

1429
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,616
Would you lighten up a lot?

1430
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:54,953
– Yeah.
– Yes or no?

1431
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,830
– Yes.
– Would you let me and Pam

1432
01:37:56,997 --> 01:37:58,957
live our lives and
not interfere all the time?

1433
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:01,960
I promise not to interfere
in your lives all the time.

1434
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:04,463
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1435
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:08,258
Could you at least try, maybe,
to consider another profession?

1436
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,135
– Jack, yes or no?
– Ever?

1437
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:12,804
– No!
– OK, yes.

1438
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:14,806
Would you let me and Pam
sleep in the same room?

1439
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:18,810
Don't push it, Focker.
You're in a real mess.

1440
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,315
If you married my daughter,
would you support her

1441
01:38:23,482 --> 01:38:25,484
in the way that she
deserves to be supported?

1442
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:26,985
Yes.

1443
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:29,321
Would you be
honest and faithful to her?

1444
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,239
Yes.

1445
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:35,827
Will you devote yourself entirely to her
for the rest of your life?

1446
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:38,080
Of course.

1447
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:40,582
Gaylord Focker…

1448
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,087
…will you be my son-in-law?

1449
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,862
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.

1450
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:14,241
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.

1451
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:16,368
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

1452
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:21,498
No. Don't worry. It's OK.
We worked out a lot of our issues.

1453
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:24,709
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

1454
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,630
Yeah. First he gave me his little
human lie detector thing, but I passed.

1455
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:30,632
Good.

1456
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:33,343
Yeah, and…

1457
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:36,680
…then he proposed.

1458
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,142
Are you feeling all right?

1459
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:49,484
Listen. This weekend was a nightmare.
I had this whole elaborate plan,

1460
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:53,572
and then somewhere between
giving your sister a black eye

1461
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:57,909
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

1462
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:03,081
I just… I love you.
I love you so much.

1463
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:06,793
And our world just makes sense
when I'm with you.

1464
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,670
I think he's about to do it, Jack.

1465
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:12,048
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

1466
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:17,095
And I think if we can get through

1467
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:20,724
what we got through in the last 48
hours, we could get through anything.

1468
01:40:21,975 --> 01:40:23,476
I think so, too.

1469
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:26,313
– And, Greg, I don't…
– Wait. Hang on a second.

1470
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:27,939
Mr. Jinx?

1471
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,739
Hi, Jinx…

1472
01:40:37,616 --> 01:40:39,451
That's a ring.

1473
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:44,706
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

1474
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,586
Pam?

1475
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:52,297
– Will you marry me?
– Yes.

1476
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,634
Yes.

1477
01:40:58,637 --> 01:41:00,138
Yes.

1478
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,851
Attaboy, Greg!

1479
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:07,979
That «circle of trust» thing?
That's mine.

1480
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,611
Well, looks like we got
another wedding to plan.

1481
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:17,489
Yep. Just gotta do one more thing.
What's that?

1482
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:19,282
Meet his parents.

1483
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,993
– Jack…
– Honey, relax.

1484
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,746
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

1485
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:27,540
Good night, Jack.

1486
01:41:35,507 --> 01:41:38,843
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker.

1487
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,516
Do you, Debra Byrnes,
take Robert Banks

1488
01:41:44,683 --> 01:41:48,061
– to be your lawfully wedded husband?
– Yes. I mean, I do.

1489
01:41:48,228 --> 01:41:50,855
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1490
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:11,543
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

1491
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:38,611
I knew it.

1492
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:41,489
<i>Shit!</i>

1493
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,325
– I knew it.
<i>– Damn it!</i>

1494
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:55,295
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

1495
01:42:55,462 --> 01:42:57,464
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

1496
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,550
<i>Oh, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.</i>

1497
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:05,055
<i>What's that, Jack? What?
You're a big, bad CIA man, huh?</i>

1498
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:08,600
<i>They teach you that in the CIA?
They teach you that?</i>

1499
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:10,810
<i>Oh, yeah. What's that, Jack?</i>

1500
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:15,940
<i>What? Yeah, you thought Puff was just
the name of the boy's magical dragon?</i>

1501
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,984
<i>Not too quick on the uptake, huh, Jack?</i>

1502
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:20,445
<i>Why don't you ask Denny
who's puffin' the magic dragon?</i>

1503
01:43:20,612 --> 01:43:24,824
<i>Not onto that one, huh? Surprising
for a big CIA pulse detector.</i>

1504
01:43:25,492 --> 01:43:28,119
<i>Hey, hey, check my pulse
on this question, Jack.</i>

1505
01:43:28,286 --> 01:43:30,372
<i>Do I think you're a psycho? Yes.</i>

1506
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:34,417
<i>What? Oh, you like my little gift?</i>

1507
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:37,128
<i>What? The Jerusalem what?</i>

1508
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:40,298
<i>What? I can't hear you. Jerusalem
toodle-oo-poosey, poosley-loo?</i>

1509
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:43,134
<i>What? What? Oh, you don't
know shit about flowers.</i>

1510
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:45,095
<i>What's that? You want me to what?</i>

1511
01:43:45,261 --> 01:43:47,138
<i>You have another question?
Sure. I got one question for you.</i>

1512
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:49,808
<i>It's… Can you deal with that?</i>

1513
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:40,000
