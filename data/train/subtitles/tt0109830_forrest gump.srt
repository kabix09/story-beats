1
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,701
Hello.

2
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,330
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,921
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,927
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:44,308
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,188
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,948
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,995
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,667
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,877
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,755
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,050
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,037
where they're going, where they've been.

14
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,438
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:39,363
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,910
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,330
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

18
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,783
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
<i><b>FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</b></i>

20
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,343
Let's take a little walk around.

21
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,935
How do those feel?

22
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,065
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

23
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,651
as strong as I've ever seen,

24
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,113
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

25
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,534
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

26
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,702
Forrest!

27
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,413
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

28
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,333
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

29
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,835
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

30
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,129
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

31
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>And what he did was,</i>

32
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

33
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,347
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

34
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,768
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

35
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,730
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

36
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,858
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

37
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,360
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

38
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,195
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

39
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,823
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

40
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

41
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,877
Okay... Get it, get it...

42
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,922
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

43
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,341
All right...

44
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,593
What are you all staring at?

45
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,139
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

46
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,395
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

47
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,064
If God intended everybody to be the same,

48
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,274
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

49
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,153
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

50
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,117
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

51
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,245
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

52
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,081
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

53
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,585
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

54
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,713
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

55
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:02,589
<i>something like that.</i>

56
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

57
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,220
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

58
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,264
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

59
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,309
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

60
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,104
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

61
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,940
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

62
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:25,028
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

63
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,908
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

64
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:34,163
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

65
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,126
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

66
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,420
Now, his IQ is 75.

67
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,340
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

68
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,971
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

69
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,975
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

70
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,311
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

71
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,689
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.

72
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,026
Now, this is normal.

73
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,821
Forrest is right here.

74
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:14,203
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

75
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,581
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

76
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,791
Now, he'll be just fine.

77
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,669
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

78
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,131
He might be a bit on the slow side,

79
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,051
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

80
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,637
the same opportunities as everyone else.

81
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,516
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

82
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,769
We're talking about
five little points here.

83
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,106
There must be something can be done.

84
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,152
We're a progressive school system.

85
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,906
We don't want to see anybody left behind.

86
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,244
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

87
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,374
He's on vacation.

88
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,645
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

89
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,611
You don't say much, do you?

90
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,083
"Finally, he had to try.

91
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,127
"It looked easy, but,

92
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,672
"oh, what happened.

93
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,758
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

94
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,886
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

95
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,225
Vacation's when you go somewhere

96
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,938
and you don't ever come back.

97
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,071
<i>Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.</i>

98
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,909
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

99
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,579
<i>There was always folks coming and going.</i>

100
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,747
Supper.

101
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,250
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

102
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,878
<i>Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

103
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,631
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

104
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,343
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

105
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,387
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

106
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,891
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

107
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,518
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

108
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,230
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

109
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,207
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

110
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,682
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

111
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,544
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

112
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,589
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

113
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,634
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.

114
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,888
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

115
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,848
Slow it down some.

116
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,894
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

117
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,313
<i>It sounded good.</i>

118
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:34,277
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

119
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,196
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

120
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,326
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

121
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,413
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

122
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,081
<i>and guess what?</i>

123
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,263
This is not for children's eyes.

124
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,642
<i>Some years later, that handsome young man</i>

125
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,270
<i>who they called "The King,"</i>

126
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,647
<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>

127
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,859
<i>had himself a heart attack, or something.</i>

128
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,112
Must be hard being a king.

129
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,713
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

130
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,874
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

131
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:35,172
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</i>

132
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,427
Are you coming along?

133
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,014
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

134
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,266
This is the bus to school.

135
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

136
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,443
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

137
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,249
This seat's taken.

138
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,212
It's taken!

139
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,971
You can't sit here.

140
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,560
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

141
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,021
<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>

142
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,858
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

143
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,986
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

144
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,783
But I do remember the first time I heard

145
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,702
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

146
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,580
You can sit here if you want.

147
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,379
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

148
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,173
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

149
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,176
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

150
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,933
What's wrong with your legs?

151
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,271
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

152
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,357
<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

153
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,526
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

154
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,320
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

155
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,665
These are going to make me...

156
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:28,430
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

157
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,912
Are you stupid or something?

158
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,999
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

159
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,296
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

160
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,798
<i>From that day on, we was always together.</i>

161
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,718
<i>Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.</i>

162
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,931
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

163
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,726
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

164
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,437
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

165
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,564
"...a good little monkey and..."

166
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,569
<i>She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.</i>

167
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,658
<i>Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.</i>

168
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:13,663
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

169
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,668
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

170
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,837
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

171
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,424
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

172
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,512
My only friend.

173
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:37,103
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

174
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,564
Some people don't think so, but they do.

175
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,194
Hey, dummy!

176
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,238
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

177
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,825
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

178
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,246
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

179
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,583
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

180
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,211
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

181
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,129
We're gonna get you!

182
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,842
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

183
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,471
Come back here, you!

184
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,570
Run, Forrest!

185
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,072
Run!

186
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,148
<i>Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,</i>

187
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,776
but I can run like the wind blows.

188
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,116
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

189
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,285
I was running!

190
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,704
He's getting away! Stop him!

191
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,155
That boy sure is a running fool.

192
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,802
<i>Now, remember how I told you that</i>

193
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,789
<i>Jenny never seemed to want to go home?</i>

194
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,917
<i>Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

195
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,169
<i>Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,</i>

196
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,589
<i>and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.</i>

197
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,509
Jenny?

198
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,719
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

199
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:19,432
<i>He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.</i>

200
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,605
<i>And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.</i>

201
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,692
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

202
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,820
Daddy's taking a nap.

203
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,571
- Jenny!
- Come on!

204
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,575
Jenny, where'd you run to?

205
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,579
You'd better get back here, girl!

206
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,707
Where you at?

207
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,381
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

208
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,718
Jenny!

209
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,763
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

210
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,056
Jenny!

211
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,309
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

212
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,145
far, far away from here.

213
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,898
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

214
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,108
far, far away from here.

215
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,278
<i>Mama always said that God is mysterious.</i>

216
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,571
Jenny!

217
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,948
<i>He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.</i>

218
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,247
You'd better get back here!

219
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,758
<i>Instead,</i>

220
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,956
<i>he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.</i>

221
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,127
<i>She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

222
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,422
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

223
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:40,096
<i>Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,</i>

224
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,266
<i>just 'cause she said she was scared.</i>

225
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,810
<i>Scared of what, I don't know,</i>

226
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,147
<i>but I think it was her grandma's dog.</i>

227
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,024
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

228
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,485
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends</i>

229
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,091
<i>all the way up through high school.</i>

230
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,866
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

231
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,286
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

232
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,455
did you hear me, stupid?

233
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,408
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

234
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:08,958
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

235
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,794
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

236
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,047
Run, Forrest! Run!

237
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,675
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

238
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:23,139
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

239
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,810
Jack rabbit!

240
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,487
Yeah!

241
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,490
Go! Go! Go!

242
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,826
Run, Forrest!

243
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,416
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

244
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,504
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

245
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:27,704
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

246
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,540
Just a local idiot.

247
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,711
<i>And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.</i>

248
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,928
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

249
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,638
- Okay!
- Run!

250
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,267
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

251
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,282
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

252
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,412
No! Turn! Go!

253
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,260
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

254
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,262
but he sure is fast!

255
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:34,270
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.</i>

256
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,523
<i>Federal troops enforcing a court order</i>

257
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,610
<i>integrated the University
of Alabama today.</i>

258
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,944
<i>Two Negroes were admitted,</i>

259
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,281
<i>but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat</i>

260
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,949
<i>to stand in the school house door.</i>

261
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:51,662
<i>Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...</i>

262
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,790
Earl, what's going on?

263
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,210
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

264
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,120
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

265
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,838
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

266
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:05,468
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

267
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,012
With us? They do?

268
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,474
<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise</i>

269
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,809
<i>to block the doorway,</i>

270
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,981
<i>President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense</i>

271
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,896
<i>then to use military force.</i>

272
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,690
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,</i>

273
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,069
<i>commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.</i>

274
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,864
<i>...because these National Guardsmen
are here today</i>

275
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,492
<i>as federal soldiers for Alabamans.</i>

276
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,496
<i>They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.</i>

277
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,998
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

278
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,085
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

279
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,505
<i>to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,</i>

280
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:48,886
<i>just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.</i>

281
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,851
<i>And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama</i>

282
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,186
<i>in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated</i>

283
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,273
<i>and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone</i>

284
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,443
<i>had been signed up for summer classes.</i>

285
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,865
<i>Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am...</i>

286
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,367
<i>Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.</i>

287
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,037
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...</i>

288
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,206
Say, wasn't that Gump?

289
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,377
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

290
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,967
<i>A few years later, that angry little man</i>

291
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,553
<i>at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea</i>

292
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,805
<i>and ran for president.</i>

293
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,561
<i>But somebody thought that it wasn't.</i>

294
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,315
But he didn't die.

295
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,571
My bus is here.

296
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,408
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

297
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,578
It was nice talking to you.

298
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,585
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

299
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,921
I was in college.

300
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,352
Did you go to a girls' college,

301
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:08,197
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

302
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,258
It was co-ed.

303
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,094
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

304
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,472
It was a college just for girls.

305
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,767
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

306
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,882
That hurts.

307
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,062
Forrest! Forrest!

308
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,276
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

309
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,485
What are you doing?

310
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,875
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

311
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:14,991
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

312
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,596
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

313
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,828
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

314
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,872
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

315
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,166
He doesn't know any better!

316
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,588
Forrest, why did you do that?

317
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,510
I brought you some chocolate.

318
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,596
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,059
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

320
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,356
Look at you.

321
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,527
Come on. Come on.

322
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,911
Is this your room?

323
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,627
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

324
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,797
about who you're gonna be?

325
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,716
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,635
Aren't I going to be me?

327
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:19,388
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

328
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,559
You know? I want to be famous.

329
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,064
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

330
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,401
I just want to be on an empty stage

331
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,779
with my guitar, my voice.

332
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,074
Just me.

333
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,912
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

334
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,918
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

335
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,303
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

336
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,600
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

337
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,965
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

338
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,225
It's all right.

339
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,230
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

340
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,658
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

341
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,664
No.

342
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,007
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

343
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,176
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

344
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,637
Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,184
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

346
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,362
<i>College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.</i>

347
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,699
<i>They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,</i>

348
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,536
<i>where you get to meet
the President of the United States.</i>

349
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,360
<i>President Kennedy met with the Collegiate</i>

350
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,957
<i>All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.</i>

351
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,461
<i>Now, the really good thing about meeting</i>

352
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,381
<i>the President of the United States
is the food.</i>

353
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,134
<i>They put you in this little room
with just about anything</i>

354
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,720
<i>you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

355
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,724
<i>And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,</i>

356
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,435
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

357
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,605
<i>I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

358
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,958
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

359
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,570
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

360
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,004
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

361
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:25,640
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

362
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,661
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

363
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,496
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

364
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.</i>

365
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,211
<i>I believe he said he had to "go pee."</i>

366
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,312
<i>Sometime later, for no particular reason,</i>

367
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,815
<i>somebody shot that nice young President,</i>

368
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,317
<i>when he was riding in his car.</i>

369
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:05,114
<i>And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,</i>

370
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,283
<i>only he was in a hotel kitchen.</i>

371
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,161
It must be hard being brothers.

372
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,372
I wouldn't know.

373
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,332
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

374
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,750
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

375
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,754
<i>After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.</i>

376
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,798
Congratulations, son.

377
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,634
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

378
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,806
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

379
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,017
Congratulations, son.

380
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,145
Have you given any thought
to your future?

381
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,315
Thought?

382
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,651
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

383
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,696
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

384
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,490
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

385
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,494
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

386
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,622
This seat's taken.

387
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,875
Taken.

388
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,631
<i>At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,</i>

389
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,716
<i>seeing how it was only my induction day</i>

390
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,552
<i>and I was already getting yelled at.</i>

391
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,891
You can sit down if you want to.

392
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,853
<i>I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.</i>

393
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,564
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

394
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,693
No, but I been on a real big boat.

395
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:28,322
I'm talking about a shrimp-catching boat.

396
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,866
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

397
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,744
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

398
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,913
when I was about maybe nine.

399
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,167
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

400
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,881
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

401
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,219
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

402
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,931
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

403
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,351
<i>So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

404
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,311
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp,</i>

405
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,441
<i>and her mama before her cooked shrimp,</i>

406
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,569
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

407
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,916
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

408
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:11,573
<i>there was to know
about the shrimping business.</i>

409
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,702
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

410
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,746
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

411
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,207
after I get out the Army.

412
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,919
Okay.

413
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:28,257
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

414
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,884
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

415
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,304
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

416
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,765
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

417
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,643
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

418
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,730
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

419
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,607
Listen up, people!

420
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:49,945
<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.</i>

421
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

422
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,950
<i>You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,</i>

423
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,079
<i>and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"</i>

424
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,622
Is that clear?

425
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,791
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

426
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:06,628
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

427
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,466
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

428
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,969
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

429
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,764
less what you spend on gas, you can...

430
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,600
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

431
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,772
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

432
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,482
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

433
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:30,027
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

434
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,674
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

435
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,990
I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump.

436
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,992
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

437
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,120
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

438
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,001
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

439
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:50,839
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

440
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,926
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

441
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:59,056
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

442
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,935
There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp,

443
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,354
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

444
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:11,693
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

445
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,780
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

446
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,701
That's... That's about it.

447
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,375
<i>Night time in the Army is a lonely time.</i>

448
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:30,879
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.</i>

449
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,966
<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>

450
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,765
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

451
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,407
<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over</i>

452
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,785
<i>some photos of her
in her college sweater,</i>

453
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,454
<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>

454
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,252
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

455
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,922
<i>because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

456
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:19,011
<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

457
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,638
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

458
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,434
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.</i>

459
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,019
<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>

460
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,605
<i>Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.</i>

461
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,441
<i>And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,</i>

462
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:36,320
<i>direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,</i>

463
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,115
<i>let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.</i>

464
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,953
- All right!
- Bobbi!

465
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,561
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

466
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,814
<i>She was a folk singer.</i>

467
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,326
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

468
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,911
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

469
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,708
Hey, honey, this ain't <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>

470
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,378
Hey, honey, I got something here for you.

471
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,174
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

472
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,718
I'm singing a song here.

473
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,515
Polly, get out here!

474
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,383
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

475
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,936
Oh, shut up!

476
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,357
Forrest, what are you doing here?

477
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,109
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

478
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,568
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

479
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,696
Forrest, let me down!

480
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,453
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

481
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,664
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

482
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:14,793
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

483
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,880
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

484
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,301
I can't help it. I love you.

485
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,763
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

486
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,065
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

487
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,446
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

488
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,782
Yes, I do.

489
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,581
You think I could fly off this bridge?

490
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,423
What do you mean, Jenny?

491
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,803
Nothing.

492
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,808
I gotta get out of here.

493
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,228
Wait, Jenny...

494
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,775
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

495
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,109
Can I have a ride?

496
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,778
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

497
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,196
Get in the truck.

498
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,114
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

499
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,952
They sending me to Vietnam.

500
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,124
It's this whole other country.

501
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,629
Just hang on a minute.

502
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,133
Listen, you promise me something, okay?

503
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,512
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

504
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,222
Just run away.

505
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,808
Okay.

506
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,022
Jenny.

507
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,193
I'll write you all the time.

508
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>And just like that, she was gone.</i>

509
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,766
You come back safe to me, do you hear?

510
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,063
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

511
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,983
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

512
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:30,113
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

513
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,335
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

514
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,588
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

515
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,258
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

516
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,561
we can get American shrimpers

517
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,376
to come out here and shrimp these waters.

518
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,994
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

519
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,266
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

520
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,894
You must be my FNGs.

521
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,241
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

522
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,940
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

523
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,108
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

524
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,028
who would love to grease an officer.

525
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,615
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

526
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,952
What's wrong with your lip?

527
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,371
I was born with big gums, sir.

528
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:24,167
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

529
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,770
Where you boys from in the world?

530
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,172
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

531
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,383
You twins?

532
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,887
No, we are not relations, sir.

533
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,059
Look, it's pretty basic here.

534
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,312
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

535
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,107
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

536
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,109
There is one item of GI gear

537
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,321
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

538
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,825
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

539
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,201
Try and keep your feet dry.

540
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,500
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

541
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,330
to change your socks whenever we stop.

542
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,333
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

543
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,711
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

544
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,327
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

545
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,256
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

546
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

547
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:18,966
<i>Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

548
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,559
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

549
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,854
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

550
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>in every single American war.</i>

551
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,332
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

552
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:35,238
Get on it!

553
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,700
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

554
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,248
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

555
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,542
Little Rock's a fine town.

556
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,796
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

557
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,382
draw what you need for the field.

558
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:58,386
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

559
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,389
Two standing orders in this platoon:

560
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,100
one, take good care of your feet,

561
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:09,272
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

562
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,822
I sure hope I don't let him down.

563
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:34,339
<i>I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.</i>

564
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:46,935
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

565
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,028
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

566
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

567
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,621
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

568
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:11,793
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

569
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,837
Get down! Shut up!

570
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,256
<i>...so we did.</i>

571
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,984
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

572
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,904
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

573
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,699
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

574
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,203
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

575
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,706
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

576
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,000
Man, what the hell's going on?

577
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,421
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

578
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,047
Nothing.

579
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,679
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

580
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:08,516
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

581
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,351
Come on, move out.

582
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,856
Step it up. Look alive out there.

583
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:19,235
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

584
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,737
Fire in the hole!

585
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,534
Gump, check out that hole.

586
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,621
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

587
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,874
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

588
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:43,551
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

589
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,430
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

590
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,099
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

591
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,478
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

592
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,648
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

593
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,777
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

594
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,948
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

595
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,451
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

596
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,913
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

597
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,792
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

598
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,255
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

599
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,799
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

600
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,801
like brothers and stuff.

601
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,431
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

602
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,518
I got a very important question
to ask you.

603
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:39,107
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

604
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,943
Okay.

605
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:45,446
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

606
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,324
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

607
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,786
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

608
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,122
We ain't got to pay no rent.

609
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,336
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

610
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,628
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

611
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:04,299
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

612
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,635
That's a fine idea.

613
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,847
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

614
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,729
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

615
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,733
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

616
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:26,821
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

617
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,657
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

618
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,995
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

619
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,539
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

620
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,919
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

621
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:47,383
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

622
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:06,027
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

623
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:09,030
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

624
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:13,368
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

625
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,206
Ambush!

626
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,083
Take cover!

627
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,879
Get down!

628
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,422
Get the sixty!

629
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,719
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

630
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,888
Forrest, you okay?

631
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,727
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

632
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,730
Medic, we got a man down!

633
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,733
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

634
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,779
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

635
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,408
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

636
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,868
Misfire! Misfire!

637
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,248
God damn it! Mac!

638
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,627
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

639
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,754
Jesus!

640
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,090
My unit is down hard and hurting!

641
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,760
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

642
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,555
Pull back! Pull back!

643
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,724
Run! Run, Forrest!

644
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,143
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

645
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,895
Run, man! Run!

646
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,731
Pull back! Run!

647
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,776
Run, God damn it, run!

648
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:54,594
Medic! Can I get a medic?

649
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,306
<i>I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.</i>

650
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,938
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

651
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,940
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

652
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,026
Bubba!

653
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,948
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

654
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,704
Any friendlies out there?

655
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,832
Yeah, I've got three over here.

656
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,460
Where the hell are you?

657
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,378
Bubba?

658
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,174
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

659
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,135
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

660
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,386
Tex!

661
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,515
Okay.

662
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,033
<i>I couldn't just let him
lay there all alone,</i>

663
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:44,529
<i>scared the way he was,</i>

664
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:48,523
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

665
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:06,082
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

666
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,710
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

667
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,262
Can't hear... Can't hear...

668
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,890
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

669
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,434
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

670
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,523
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

671
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,858
<i>...over.</i>

672
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:35,236
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

673
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,113
We got Charlie all over this area.

674
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,574
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

675
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,035
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

676
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,287
I know he's dead!

677
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,248
My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!

678
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,069
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

679
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,544
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

680
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,922
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

681
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,383
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

682
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,094
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

683
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,306
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

684
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,464
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

685
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,895
<i>Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

686
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,439
Something bit me!

687
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,448
You chink son of a bitch!

688
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,952
I can't leave the platoon.

689
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,999
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

690
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,251
Did you hear what I said?

691
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,921
God damn it, put me down!

692
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,673
Get your ass out of here!

693
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,596
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

694
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,421
Where the hell do you think you're going?

695
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,231
To get Bubba.

696
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:50,144
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

697
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,647
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

698
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,191
I gotta find Bubba!

699
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,625
Forrest.

700
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,052
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

701
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,513
I'm okay.

702
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,189
Oh, Bubba, no...

703
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,525
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

704
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,369
Come on. Come on. Come on.

705
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,875
I'm okay, Forrest.

706
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,046
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

707
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,211
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

708
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,759
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

709
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,219
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

710
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,763
Hey, Bubba.

711
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,265
Hey, Forrest.

712
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:56,812
Forrest, why'd this happen?

713
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,940
You got shot.

714
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,821
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

715
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,282
I wanna go home.

716
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,328
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

717
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:17,833
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

718
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,087
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

719
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,091
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

720
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,099
That's all I have to say about that.

721
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,645
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

722
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,650
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

723
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,154
Oh, yes, sir.

724
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,324
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

725
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:55,704
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

726
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,667
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

727
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,004
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

728
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,840
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

729
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,551
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

730
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,010
<i>And guess what?</i>

731
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,180
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

732
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,477
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.

733
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:23,023
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

734
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,037
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

735
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,881
Harper!

736
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,553
Cooper, Larson,

737
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,098
Webster,

738
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,020
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

739
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,860
Kyle, Nichols,

740
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:16,035
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

741
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,746
Holiday...

742
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,755
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

743
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,594
Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?

744
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,591
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

745
00:58:35,601 --> 00:58:38,599
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

746
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,060
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

747
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,439
Good catch, Gump.

748
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,568
You know how to play this?

749
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,947
Come on, let me show you. Here.

750
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,368
Now, the secret to this game is,

751
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:03,290
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

752
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,212
All right.

753
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,219
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

754
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:18,472
See? Any idiot can play.

755
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,725
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

756
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,270
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

757
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,606
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

758
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:40,327
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

759
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,288
<i>whatever that means.</i>

760
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,000
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

761
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,384
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

762
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,314
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

763
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,400
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

764
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,194
I should have died out there with my men,

765
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,324
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

766
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,994
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

767
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:23,871
Do you see that?

768
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,708
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

769
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:32,671
Yes, sir, I do.

770
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,385
Did you hear what I said?

771
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,055
You cheated me.

772
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,264
I had a destiny.

773
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:45,893
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

774
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,606
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

775
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,951
Do you understand what I'm saying, Gump?

776
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,457
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

777
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,753
I had a destiny.

778
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,093
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

779
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,601
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

780
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,334
Look at me.

781
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,629
What am I gonna do now?

782
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,343
What am I gonna do now?

783
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,188
PFC Gump?

784
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,150
Yes, sir!

785
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,318
As you were.

786
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:22,656
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

787
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,327
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

788
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,838
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

789
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,549
They sent him home.

790
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,308
<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

791
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,896
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

792
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,357
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

793
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,568
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

794
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,347
<i>to men from each of the Armed Services.</i>

795
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,323
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

796
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:10,120
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

797
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:13,373
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

798
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,418
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

799
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,017
<i>God damn, son.</i>

800
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:37,981
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

801
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:41,568
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

802
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,826
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

803
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,615
What are you doing here so late?

804
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:50,744
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

805
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,997
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

806
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,708
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

807
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,753
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

808
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,549
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

809
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,345
Follow me, let's go!

810
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,765
Come on. Let's go.

811
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,398
Stand here.

812
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,028
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

813
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,447
Okay.

814
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,618
<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>

815
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:35,205
<i>And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.</i>

816
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:36,985
<i>Now, I'm gonna bring up some soldiers...</i>

817
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:39,626
<i>And he liked to say the "F" word.</i>

818
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,088
<i>A lot."F" this and "F" that.</i>

819
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,507
<i>And every time he said the "F" word,</i>

820
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,343
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.</i>

821
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:51,513
<i>...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</i>

822
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,892
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

823
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,978
Come on, man, come up here, man.

824
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,732
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

825
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:06,153
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

826
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,501
<i>Tell us a little bit about the war, man.</i>

827
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,337
<i>The war in Vietnam?</i>

828
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,340
<i>- The war in Viet-fucking-Nam!</i>
- Yeah!

829
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,778
Peace!

830
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:49,529
Come on, man, go!

831
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,782
- Come on!
- Peace!

832
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:52,908
<i>Well...</i>

833
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,495
<i>There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

834
01:05:56,536 --> 01:06:01,375
<i>...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

835
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,966
<i>In Vietnam, your...</i>

836
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,986
Hey, what the hell are you...

837
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:22,688
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

838
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,232
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

839
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,318
We can't hear you!

840
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,030
We can't hear anything!

841
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,242
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

842
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,743
Speak up!

843
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:38,996
That's it!

844
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,916
<i>...and that's all I have to say
about that.</i>

845
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,176
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

846
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,222
What's your name, man?

847
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,891
<i>My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.</i>

848
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,269
<i>Forrest Gump!</i>

849
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,770
- Gump!
- Gump!

850
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:09,026
Forrest! Forrest!

851
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,449
<i>- Jenny!</i>
- Forrest!

852
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,885
Hey! Hey!

853
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:46,104
<i>It was the happiest moment of my life.</i>

854
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,818
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

855
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,738
<i>She showed me around,</i>

856
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,407
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

857
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:58,825
Shut that blind, man.

858
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,161
And get your white ass
away from that window.

859
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,330
Don't you know we in a war here?

860
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,655
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

861
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,657
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

862
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,795
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

863
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,630
from the racial onslaught of the pig

864
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,799
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

865
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,177
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

866
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,015
Who's the baby killer?

867
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,851
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

868
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,686
Forrest, this is Wesley.

869
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,136
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

870
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,774
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

871
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,317
Let me tell you something else.

872
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:36,655
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

873
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,283
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

874
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:44,037
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

875
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,039
to die for a country that hates them.

876
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:49,292
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

877
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:52,504
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

878
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,172
as they sleep in their beds at night.

879
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,382
You are a fucking asshole!

880
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,844
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

881
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:11,356
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

882
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,568
Forrest!

883
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,903
Stop it! Stop it!

884
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:24,911
Oh, God...

885
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,165
I shouldn't have brought you here.

886
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:31,877
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

887
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,672
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

888
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,345
Come on, Forrest.

889
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:52,063
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

890
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,550
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

891
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,896
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

892
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,783
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

893
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,288
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

894
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,218
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

895
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:25,805
You look handsome in it. You do.

896
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,811
- You know what?
- What?

897
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,069
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

898
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,447
Me, too, Forrest.

899
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:47,160
<i>We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.</i>

900
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,415
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.</i>

901
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:57,128
<i>And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind</i>

902
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:00,257
<i>and learn how to live in harmony,</i>

903
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,676
<i>which must be out west somewhere,</i>

904
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,095
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

905
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,430
<i>Try to love one another right now</i>

906
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,682
Hey!

907
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,185
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

908
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,145
- I'll go.
- Far out.

909
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,775
<i>It was a very special night
for the two of us.</i>

910
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,445
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

911
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,657
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

912
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:28,451
I have to, Forrest.

913
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,704
Jenny?

914
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,500
Things got a little out of hand.

915
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:39,379
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

916
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,842
I would never hurt you, you know that.

917
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,972
You know what I think?

918
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:55,729
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

919
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,328
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

920
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:23,923
I want you to have this.

921
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,764
Forrest, I can't keep this.

922
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:36,686
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

923
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,899
Why are you so good to me?

924
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,943
You're my girl.

925
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,073
I'll always be your girl.

926
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:33,326
<i>And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.</i>

927
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,163
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

928
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,001
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

929
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,176
<i>I thought I was going back to Vietnam,</i>

930
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,513
<i>but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists</i>

931
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,223
<i>was to play Ping-Pong.</i>

932
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,600
<i>So, I was in the Special Services,</i>

933
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,937
<i>traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans</i>

934
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,440
and showing them how to play Ping-Pong.

935
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,442
I was so good that some years later

936
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:09,154
<i>the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

937
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,198
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

938
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,701
<i>in like a million years,
or something like that.</i>

939
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:18,246
<i>Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,</i>

940
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,166
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

941
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,294
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

942
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:27,297
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

943
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,049
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.</i>

944
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,558
<i>Mr. Gump, have a seat.</i>

945
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,229
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

946
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,550
<i>- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.</i>

947
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,897
<i>Can you tell us, what was China like?</i>

948
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:57,076
<i>In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.</i>

949
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,745
<i>No possessions?</i>

950
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:04,584
<i>And in China, they never go to church.</i>

951
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,587
<i>No religion, too?</i>

952
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:12,800
<i>- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

953
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,971
<i>Some years later,
that nice young man from England</i>

954
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,724
<i>was on his way home to see his little boy</i>

955
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:22,769
<i>and was signing some autographs,</i>

956
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:26,856
<i>and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.</i>

957
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:33,738
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

958
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,116
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

959
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,538
Lieutenant Dan!

960
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:46,084
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

961
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,462
Yes, sir, they surely did.

962
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,548
They gave you,

963
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:55,802
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

964
01:15:55,885 --> 01:16:00,139
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

965
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,309
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

966
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:05,645
Yes, sir.

967
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,650
Well, then, that's just perfect!

968
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,904
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

969
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,240
God damn bless America.

970
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,450
Hey!

971
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,579
Oh, God!

972
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,500
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

973
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,379
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.</i>

974
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,423
<i>And because he didn't have no legs,</i>

975
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,676
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

976
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:42,015
Take a right. Take a right.

977
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,186
Hey! Come on, already!

978
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,064
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

979
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,692
I'm living off the government tit.

980
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:55,695
Sucking it dry!

981
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,822
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

982
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,645
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

983
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,285
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

984
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:13,087
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.</i>

985
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,928
<i>You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.</i>

986
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,726
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

987
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:31,981
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

988
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,949
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

989
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:44,452
that's all they ever talk about.

990
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,581
Jesus this and Jesus that.

991
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,335
Have I found Jesus?

992
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,963
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

993
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:01,511
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

994
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,181
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

995
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,977
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

996
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:12,230
Did you hear what I said?

997
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:17,276
Walk beside him in the kingdom of heaven.

998
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,321
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

999
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:23,783
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

1000
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,081
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

1001
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,042
Oh?

1002
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,257
Well,

1003
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,596
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1004
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,182
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1005
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:53,396
<i>We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.</i>

1006
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,314
<i>This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.</i>

1007
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,608
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1008
01:18:57,692 --> 01:19:00,027
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1009
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,530
Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?

1010
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,440
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1011
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:05,700
soon as I have some money.

1012
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,619
I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam

1013
01:19:08,703 --> 01:19:11,414
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1014
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,917
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1015
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:18,463
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1016
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,257
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,093
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1018
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:28,055
Now hear this!

1019
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:32,643
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1020
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,812
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1021
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:37,356
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1022
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,985
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1023
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:45,406
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1024
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:48,493
Danny, what are you complaining about?

1025
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:51,162
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1026
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,874
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1027
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,921
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1028
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:04,217
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1029
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,833
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1030
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,583
'cause Tommy bought a round on the house

1031
01:20:07,622 --> 01:20:09,231
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1032
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:11,925
Well, well, I had company.

1033
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:16,437
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1034
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:21,192
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1035
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,570
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1036
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:27,198
<i>It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,</i>

1037
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,575
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1038
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,956
<i>wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.</i>

1039
01:20:57,562 --> 01:21:01,065
<i>...eight, seven, six, five,</i>

1040
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,652
four, three, two, one!

1041
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,446
Happy New Year!

1042
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,632
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1043
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,588
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1044
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,673
What's his problem?

1045
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:10,009
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1046
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,178
What, is your friend stupid or something?

1047
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,346
What did you say?

1048
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,214
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1049
01:22:15,224 --> 01:22:17,058
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1050
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,101
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1051
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:21,302
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1052
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,095
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1053
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,263
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1054
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,848
You belong in <i>Ripley's Believe It Or Not!</i>

1055
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,808
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1056
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:28,861
Go on! Get out of here!

1057
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,685
Come on, Lenore. We don't need this shit!

1058
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,071
Get out of here!

1059
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:35,868
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1060
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,458
No, no.

1061
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:11,570
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1062
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,448
She tasted like cigarettes.

1063
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:35,136
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.</i>

1064
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:37,401
<i>He didn't want to be called crippled,</i>

1065
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:40,359
<i>just like I didn't want
to be called stupid.</i>

1066
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:47,732
Happy New Year, Gump.

1067
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,946
<i>The US Ping-Pong team</i>

1068
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:56,554
<i>met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...</i>

1069
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,118
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1070
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:03,164
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1071
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,499
So, I went, again.

1072
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,795
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1073
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,507
<i>Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1074
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:16,969
<i>So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?</i>

1075
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:20,056
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?</i>

1076
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:22,767
<i>- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1077
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,978
<i>I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.</i>

1078
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:28,064
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it for you.</i>

1079
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:29,815
<i>Security, Frank Wills.</i>

1080
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:33,486
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1081
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,280
over to that office across the way.

1082
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:39,453
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1083
01:24:39,463 --> 01:24:41,994
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1084
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,704
<i>Okay, sir. I'll check it out.</i>

1085
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:45,498
- Thank you.
<i>- No problem.</i>

1086
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,500
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

1087
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:56,509
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1088
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,636
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1089
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,224
<i>will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.</i>

1090
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,396
<i>As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...</i>

1091
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:16,195
Sergeant Gump.

1092
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,906
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1093
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,118
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1094
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:28,290
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1095
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:30,334
For the Army it does.

1096
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:37,842
<i>And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.</i>

1097
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:44,932
<i>So, I went home.</i>

1098
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:09,832
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1099
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,328
- Louise, he's here.
<i>- Now, when I got home,</i>

1100
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:17,131
<i>I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.</i>

1101
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,592
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1102
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,761
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1103
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:26,599
One man even left a check for $25,000

1104
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,144
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1105
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,938
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1106
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,024
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1107
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,027
I know that. I know that.

1108
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,779
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1109
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:45,576
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1110
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,818
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
<i>- That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1111
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,331
- You look real good.
<i>- It's funny how things work out.</i>

1112
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:53,626
<i>I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,</i>

1113
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,961
<i>and I always try to keep my promise.</i>

1114
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,569
<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>

1115
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,383
<i>to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.</i>

1116
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:05,137
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1117
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,140
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1118
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:09,558
I guess.

1119
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,146
<i>And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.</i>

1120
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:18,692
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1121
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,866
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1122
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:35,459
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1123
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,172
<i>Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,</i>

1124
01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:42,174
<i>and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1125
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:45,511
<i>and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1126
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,846
Tell me something.

1127
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,016
Are you stupid or something?

1128
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,185
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1129
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:56,188
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1130
01:27:57,062 --> 01:27:59,454
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,"

1131
01:27:59,464 --> 01:28:03,195
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1132
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:04,672
which everybody knows isn't true,

1133
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,540
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1134
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,577
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1135
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:15,541
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1136
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:18,043
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1137
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:42,985
<i>Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1138
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,404
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1139
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,408
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1140
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,454
I only caught five.

1141
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,915
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1142
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,252
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1143
01:29:02,262 --> 01:29:04,932
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1144
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:11,972
<i>I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,</i>

1145
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,352
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1146
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:40,209
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,</i>

1147
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,836
<i>but I thought about her a lot,</i>

1148
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:46,423
<i>and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1149
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:35,240
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1150
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,058
Hey!

1151
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:29,586
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1152
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:33,632
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1153
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,469
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1154
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:39,805
Yes, I know that.

1155
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,182
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1156
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:46,853
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1157
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:55,362
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1158
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,115
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1159
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:01,326
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1160
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,372
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1161
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,832
No, sir.

1162
01:33:15,716 --> 01:33:18,010
That's my boat.

1163
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:26,059
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1164
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,769
so take a left.

1165
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:32,107
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1166
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,860
Over there! They're over there!

1167
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:39,364
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1168
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:44,703
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1169
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,709
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1170
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:53,879
That's where we'll find them.

1171
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:10,687
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1172
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,608
How are we going to find them?

1173
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,235
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1174
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,536
<i>So, I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1175
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,790
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1176
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,918
<i>though I think
he left the praying up to me.</i>

1177
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:52,771
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1178
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:59,319
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.</i>

1179
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:21,007
- You'll never sink this boat!
<i>- Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1180
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:24,177
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1181
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:25,637
Come on!

1182
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:33,979
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1183
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:40,485
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1184
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,489
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1185
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:50,162
You'll never sink this boat!

1186
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:54,374
<i>Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,</i>

1187
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,043
<i>destroying nearly everything in its path.</i>

1188
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,671
<i>And as in other towns
up and down the coast,</i>

1189
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:02,215
<i>Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry</i>

1190
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:06,178
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1191
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:09,473
<i>Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,</i>

1192
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,976
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.</i>

1193
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,979
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1194
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,690
<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

1195
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:27,532
<i>Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails</i>

1196
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:31,703
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1197
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:35,165
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1198
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:39,836
We got a whole bunch of boats, 12 <i>Jennys,</i>

1199
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:43,381
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1200
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:47,010
Bubba-Gump Shrimp. It's a household name.

1201
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:48,929
Hold on there, boy.

1202
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:53,600
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1203
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:56,728
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1204
01:36:58,355 --> 01:37:02,400
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1205
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:07,906
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1206
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:16,039
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1207
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:21,086
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1208
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:25,465
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1209
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,092
Well, yes, I would.

1210
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:34,349
That's him right there.

1211
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,737
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1212
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:40,939
Forrest,

1213
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,281
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1214
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:21,605
<i>He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.</i>

1215
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,489
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1216
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:35,076
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1217
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,494
<i>Base to</i> Jenny 1.

1218
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:40,040
<i>- Base to</i> Jenny 1.
<i>- Jenny 1</i>. Go, Margo.

1219
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,666
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1220
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:44,210
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1221
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:47,672
- He is indisposed at the moment.
<i>- His mama's sick.</i>

1222
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,737
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1223
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,533
Hi, Forrest.

1224
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:19,037
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1225
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,880
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1226
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:44,187
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1227
01:39:47,524 --> 01:39:49,901
Come on in, sit down over here.

1228
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:07,752
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1229
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,630
It's just my time.

1230
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:16,261
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1231
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:20,265
Death is just a part of life,

1232
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:23,893
something we're all destined to do.

1233
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:30,108
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1234
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:34,529
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1235
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:40,493
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1236
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:45,248
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1237
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,254
What's my destiny, Mama?

1238
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,634
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1239
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,930
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1240
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:03,141
You never know what you're going to get.

1241
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:07,645
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>

1242
01:41:07,729 --> 01:41:09,939
I will miss you, Forrest.

1243
01:41:11,775 --> 01:41:15,820
<i>She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1244
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:20,658
<i>I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.</i>

1245
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,998
And that's all I have to say about that.

1246
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,273
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1247
01:41:36,283 --> 01:41:39,077
There'll be another one along shortly.

1248
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:46,476
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1249
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:49,646
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1250
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:53,358
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1251
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:56,694
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1252
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:01,741
<i>So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1253
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,577
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.</i>

1254
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:09,332
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1255
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:11,157
<i>And so then, I got a call from him saying</i>

1256
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:14,546
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1257
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:16,881
"That's good. One less thing."

1258
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:23,304
<i>Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,</i>

1259
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:27,433
<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>

1260
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:31,396
<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>

1261
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:38,570
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>

1262
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:45,451
<i>And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1263
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:48,204
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1264
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:54,127
You know what?

1265
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,423
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1266
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:00,091
That smells wonderful.

1267
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:04,888
<i>And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1268
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:07,265
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1269
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,938
<i>But at night time
when there was nothing to do</i>

1270
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:16,399
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1271
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,777
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1272
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:26,636
<i>And then, she was there.</i>

1273
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,797
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1274
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,978
<i>Jenny came back and stayed with me.</i>

1275
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:22,233
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1276
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:26,070
<i>or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed</i>

1277
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:30,158
<i>and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1278
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:33,703
<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>

1279
01:45:35,038 --> 01:45:40,209
<i>Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1280
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,795
<i>and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,</i>

1281
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:47,216
<i>and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.</i>

1282
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:50,595
<i>Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</i>

1283
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,971
How could you do this?

1284
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:14,262
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1285
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:20,977
<i>I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.</i>

1286
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:25,440
<i>It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.</i>

1287
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:31,863
<i>Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,</i>

1288
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:36,993
<i>and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.</i>

1289
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,871
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1290
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:48,171
<i>And she even showed me how to dance.</i>

1291
01:47:56,345 --> 01:48:00,558
<i>And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.</i>

1292
01:48:04,312 --> 01:48:07,231
<i>And it was the happiest time in my life.</i>

1293
01:48:26,876 --> 01:48:28,703
<i>...and this Fourth is witnessing
one of the</i>

1294
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:31,756
<i>largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...</i>

1295
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,759
- You done watching it?
<i>- ...here in New York Harbor...</i>

1296
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:37,058
- I'm going to bed.
<i>- ...with a spectacular display</i>

1297
01:48:37,068 --> 01:48:40,112
<i>of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...</i>

1298
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,856
Will you marry me?

1299
01:48:53,778 --> 01:48:56,739
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1300
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:01,452
You would, Forrest.

1301
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,623
But you won't marry me.

1302
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:10,127
You don't want to marry me.

1303
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,133
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1304
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:23,266
I'm not a smart man,

1305
01:49:24,976 --> 01:49:27,395
but I know what love is.

1306
01:50:04,432 --> 01:50:05,683
Jenny.

1307
01:50:07,602 --> 01:50:10,104
Forrest, I do love you.

1308
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,911
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1309
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:43,841
<i>That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1310
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:49,430
<i>So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,</i>

1311
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:51,340
<i>I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.</i>

1312
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:54,602
<i>President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of...</i>

1313
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,353
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1314
01:52:56,437 --> 01:53:00,608
<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>

1315
01:53:00,691 --> 01:53:03,110
<i>And I figured since I'd run this far,</i>

1316
01:53:03,194 --> 01:53:06,489
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1317
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,740
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1318
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:10,159
I ran clear across Alabama.

1319
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:14,371
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1320
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:17,291
I ran clear to the ocean.

1321
01:53:23,172 --> 01:53:26,342
<i>And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1322
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:29,720
<i>might as well turn around
and just keep on going.</i>

1323
01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:38,062
<i>And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1324
01:53:39,855 --> 01:53:43,567
<i>I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.</i>

1325
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:49,573
<i>When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1326
01:53:49,657 --> 01:53:52,701
When I had to go, you know...

1327
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:55,538
I went.

1328
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:58,582
And so, you just ran.

1329
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,418
Yeah.

1330
01:54:36,704 --> 01:54:41,959
<i>I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1331
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,463
<i>But most of all, I thought about Jenny.</i>

1332
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:49,717
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1333
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:53,596
<i>For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1334
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:57,057
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1335
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,310
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1336
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,395
<i>Charles Cooper brings us this report.</i>

1337
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,732
<i>For the fourth time
on his journey across America,</i>

1338
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:07,651
<i>Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1339
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:10,654
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1340
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,585
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
<i>- Sir, why are you running?</i>

1341
01:55:13,595 --> 01:55:14,491
Why are you running?

1342
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:16,160
Are you doing this for world peace?

1343
01:55:16,243 --> 01:55:17,809
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1344
01:55:17,819 --> 01:55:20,664
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1345
01:55:20,748 --> 01:55:21,790
Or for animals?

1346
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:24,752
<i>They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running</i>

1347
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,211
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1348
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:28,297
Why are you doing this?

1349
01:55:28,339 --> 01:55:30,841
I just felt like running.

1350
01:55:30,966 --> 01:55:33,344
I just felt like running.

1351
01:55:33,469 --> 01:55:36,680
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1352
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:42,645
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1353
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:45,012
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1354
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:47,153
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1355
01:55:47,278 --> 01:55:49,280
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1356
01:55:49,322 --> 01:55:53,155
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1357
01:55:53,197 --> 01:55:55,032
<i>So, I got company.</i>

1358
01:55:56,867 --> 01:56:02,706
<i>And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.</i>

1359
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,379
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1360
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:13,550
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1361
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:16,971
<i>but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.</i>

1362
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:20,432
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1363
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:22,299
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1364
01:56:22,351 --> 01:56:24,176
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1365
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:27,317
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1366
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:29,572
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1367
01:56:29,582 --> 01:56:33,210
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1368
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:37,241
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1369
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,703
Sometimes.

1370
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:45,249
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fellow</i>

1371
01:56:45,289 --> 01:56:47,072
<i>did come up with a bumper sticker slogan,</i>

1372
01:56:47,082 --> 01:56:50,294
<i>and he made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1373
01:56:51,714 --> 01:56:53,924
<i>Another time, I was running along,</i>

1374
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:57,386
<i>somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1375
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,471
<i>he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,</i>

1376
01:56:59,555 --> 01:57:02,558
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1377
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:06,103
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1378
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:12,609
Have a nice day.

1379
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,362
<i>Well, some years later,</i>

1380
01:57:15,446 --> 01:57:19,366
<i>I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1381
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:21,827
<i>He made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1382
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:29,043
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.</i>

1383
01:57:30,294 --> 01:57:31,462
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1384
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:35,966
<i>"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."</i>

1385
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:40,971
<i>And I think that's what
my running was all about.</i>

1386
01:57:41,805 --> 01:57:45,809
<i>I had run for three years, two months,</i>

1387
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:48,395
<i>14 days and 16 hours.</i>

1388
01:58:04,078 --> 01:58:06,413
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1389
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,593
I'm pretty tired.

1390
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,473
Think I'll go home now.

1391
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:45,494
Now what are we supposed to do?

1392
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:50,707
<i>And just like that,
my running days was over.</i>

1393
01:58:52,668 --> 01:58:54,419
<i>So, I went home to Alabama.</i>

1394
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:59,383
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...</i>

1395
01:59:01,135 --> 01:59:05,305
<i>...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.</i>

1396
01:59:05,806 --> 01:59:08,241
<i>The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...</i>

1397
01:59:08,251 --> 01:59:10,211
I picked up the mail.

1398
01:59:10,978 --> 01:59:14,857
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1399
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:19,194
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1400
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:21,822
and that's what I'm doing here.

1401
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,533
She saw me on TV, running.

1402
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:28,829
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1403
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:35,836
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1404
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:39,590
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1405
01:59:39,715 --> 01:59:44,261
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1406
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:48,432
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1407
01:59:51,435 --> 01:59:53,353
It was nice talking to you.

1408
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:57,024
I hope everything works out for you!

1409
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:06,450
Hey!

1410
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:08,535
Forrest!

1411
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:12,039
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1412
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:13,332
I got your letter.

1413
02:00:13,415 --> 02:00:16,043
I was wondering about that.

1414
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:19,421
Is this your house?

1415
02:00:19,463 --> 02:00:22,549
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1416
02:00:22,633 --> 02:00:26,345
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1417
02:00:33,227 --> 02:00:35,270
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1418
02:00:38,065 --> 02:00:43,487
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1419
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:45,239
There you are.

1420
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,208
And this, I got you running.

1421
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,330
I ran a long way,

1422
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:55,666
for a long time.

1423
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,378
And there...

1424
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:09,346
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1425
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:16,186
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1426
02:01:16,311 --> 02:01:21,566
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1427
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:25,988
- Hey.
- Hi.

1428
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:27,197
Hey, you.

1429
02:01:28,365 --> 02:01:31,368
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1430
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:34,584
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1431
02:01:34,594 --> 02:01:36,638
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1432
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:38,583
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1433
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:44,840
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1434
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:48,010
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1435
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:51,054
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1436
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:57,227
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1437
02:02:00,105 --> 02:02:01,940
His name's Forrest.

1438
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:04,401
Like me.

1439
02:02:06,028 --> 02:02:08,155
I named him after his daddy.

1440
02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:11,575
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1441
02:02:12,868 --> 02:02:14,911
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1442
02:02:29,384 --> 02:02:30,594
Hey.

1443
02:02:31,762 --> 02:02:34,639
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1444
02:02:37,225 --> 02:02:41,355
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1445
02:02:41,897 --> 02:02:43,273
Okay?

1446
02:02:47,611 --> 02:02:49,488
Isn't he beautiful?

1447
02:02:50,489 --> 02:02:53,450
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1448
02:02:57,245 --> 02:02:58,330
But...

1449
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,920
Is he smart, or...

1450
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:08,965
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1451
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:20,769
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1452
02:03:30,112 --> 02:03:32,948
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1453
02:03:56,054 --> 02:03:57,848
Forrest,

1454
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:00,851
I'm sick.

1455
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,190
What, do you have a cough due to a cold?

1456
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:09,651
I have some kind of virus,

1457
02:04:09,693 --> 02:04:12,404
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1458
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:15,532
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1459
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:22,205
You could come home with me.

1460
02:04:23,874 --> 02:04:29,546
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1461
02:04:33,884 --> 02:04:36,678
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1462
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:41,349
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1463
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:47,856
Okay.

1464
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:50,567
Please take your seats.

1465
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:56,740
Forrest? It's time to start.

1466
02:05:16,134 --> 02:05:17,719
Hi.

1467
02:05:18,595 --> 02:05:20,096
Your tie.

1468
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,277
Lieutenant Dan.

1469
02:05:49,626 --> 02:05:51,586
Lieutenant Dan.

1470
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,089
Hello, Forrest.

1471
02:05:54,756 --> 02:05:57,425
You got new legs. New legs!

1472
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:02,430
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1473
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:07,143
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1474
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:12,482
Magic legs.

1475
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:18,863
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1476
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,036
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1477
02:06:27,122 --> 02:06:30,333
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1478
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:33,712
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1479
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:48,018
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1480
02:06:49,894 --> 02:06:54,149
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1481
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:58,862
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1482
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:31,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

1483
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,077
Hey, Forrest.

1484
02:07:52,415 --> 02:07:54,209
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1485
02:07:55,877 --> 02:07:58,213
Yes. Well, I...

1486
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:01,257
I don't know.

1487
02:08:01,966 --> 02:08:06,930
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1488
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:12,102
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1489
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:19,442
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1490
02:08:20,735 --> 02:08:24,614
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1491
02:08:26,408 --> 02:08:30,328
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1492
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:35,041
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1493
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:40,630
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1494
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:47,262
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1495
02:08:47,804 --> 02:08:50,181
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1496
02:08:51,433 --> 02:08:53,309
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1497
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:01,109
I wish I could've been there with you.

1498
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,613
You were.

1499
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:17,792
I love you.

1500
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:25,508
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1501
02:09:27,218 --> 02:09:30,972
And I had you placed here under our tree.

1502
02:09:35,852 --> 02:09:40,690
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1503
02:09:44,819 --> 02:09:46,488
<i>Mama</i>

1504
02:09:47,572 --> 02:09:52,577
always said that dying was a part of life.

1505
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:58,333
I sure wish it wasn't.

1506
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:04,756
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1507
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,175
But...

1508
02:10:07,425 --> 02:10:10,094
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1509
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:15,725
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1510
02:10:17,894 --> 02:10:23,900
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1511
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:29,614
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1512
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:31,950
Okay.

1513
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,409
<i>He's really good.</i>

1514
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:35,578
Forrest, you go.

1515
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:41,376
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1516
02:10:44,921 --> 02:10:48,383
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1517
02:10:51,636 --> 02:10:53,888
You'd be so proud of him.

1518
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:57,058
I am.

1519
02:10:58,101 --> 02:11:01,312
He wrote you a letter.

1520
02:11:02,897 --> 02:11:04,941
And he says I can't read it.

1521
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:08,611
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1522
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:26,004
Jenny,

1523
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:35,013
I don't know if Mama was right,

1524
02:11:36,347 --> 02:11:37,849
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1525
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:40,602
I don't know

1526
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:45,148
if we each have a destiny,

1527
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:52,322
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1528
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:58,661
But I think

1529
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:02,332
maybe it's both.

1530
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:09,547
Maybe both is happening at the same time.

1531
02:12:15,678 --> 02:12:17,680
But I miss you, Jenny.

1532
02:12:24,062 --> 02:12:28,483
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1533
02:13:03,768 --> 02:13:06,729
Here's your bus. Okay.

1534
02:13:08,398 --> 02:13:11,734
Hey. I know this.

1535
02:13:11,859 --> 02:13:14,737
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1536
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:17,573
Grandma used to read it to you.

1537
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:19,742
My favorite book.

1538
02:13:23,079 --> 02:13:24,580
Here we are.

1539
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,207
Okay.

1540
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:29,419
Here you go.

1541
02:13:34,298 --> 02:13:36,801
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1542
02:13:40,263 --> 02:13:43,975
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1543
02:13:45,977 --> 02:13:48,771
I'll be right here when you get back.

1544
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:56,612
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1545
02:13:56,654 --> 02:14:00,199
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
