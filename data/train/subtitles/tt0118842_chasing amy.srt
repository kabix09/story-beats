1
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:38,491
The seminar will begin in five minutes.

2
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:41,369
It will be in room "C."

3
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,164
So, uh, how about Chow Yun Fat?

4
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,584
I don't know.
I love Chow Yun Fat.

5
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,878
- I just don't see him playing Madman.
- Awesome.

6
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,339
Thank you.

7
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,974
"To a really big fan"?

8
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,769
Uh, you bet.

9
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,355
I love this book, man.
This shit is awesome!

10
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,357
I wish I was like these guys.
Gettin' stoned,

11
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,986
talkin' all raw about chicks and fightin' supervillains!

12
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,990
I love these guys! You know what.
They're like Bill and Ted...

13
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,158
meet Cheech and Chong!

14
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,369
Yeah. I kind of
like to think of them...

15
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:25,997
as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
meet Vladimir and Estragon.

16
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes! Who?

17
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,504
So, do you, like, draw this or something?

18
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,968
I ink it, and I'm also the colorist.
The guy next to me draws it.

19
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,512
But we both came up
with the characters. Next!

20
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,014
What does that mean, you "ink it"?

21
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,933
Well, it means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil.

22
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,895
And then he gives it to me
to go over in ink. Next!

23
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,189
So, basically, you just trace.

24
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,568
It's, uh, it's not tracing, all right?

25
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,529
I add depth and shading to give the image more definition.

26
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,449
Only then does the drawing truly take shape.

27
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:06,787
No, no, no. You go over what he draws
with a pen, all right? That's tracing.

28
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,707
Not really. Next.

29
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,670
Hey, man, let me ask you somethin'.

30
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,090
Somebody draws something
and then you draw the exact same thing,

31
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,719
like, right on top of it without going
outside the original designated art.

32
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,763
What do you call that?

33
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,432
- I don't know, man. Tracing?
- See?

34
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,017
You want your book signed or what?

35
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,228
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

36
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,565
Don't get all testy just because you
got a problem with your station in life.

37
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,983
Oh, I'm secure with what I do.

38
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,153
Then just say it.
You're a tracer.

39
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,446
How should I sign this?

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,448
I don't want you to sign it, man.

41
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,784
I want the guy who draws Bluntman & Chronic to sign it.

42
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,454
- You're just the tracer.
- Tell him, little shaver.

43
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,416
Who do I sign it to?

44
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,877
You fuckin' tracer!

45
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,756
I'll trace a chalk line around
your dead fuckin' body, you fuck!

46
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,758
Would you get him outta here?

47
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,555
Hey, wait a second! He jumped me!
You fuckin' tracer!

48
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,890
Your mother's a tracer!

49
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,934
Can I explain the audience principle to you?

50
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,894
If you assault and accost them, then we have no audience.

51
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,648
He started it,
fuckin' cock-knocker!

52
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:19,777
He's lucky I didn't put my pen through his thorax!

53
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,781
Need I remind you?
Curtain's in ten minutes. Okay?

54
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,118
The Word's Up: Minority Voices
in Comics panel discussion...

55
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,371
- All right.
- ...is about to begin in room "F."

56
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,292
For years in this industry...

57
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,461
whenever an African-American
character, hero or villain,

58
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,799
was introduced, usually, by white artists and writers,

59
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,927
they got slapped with racist names...

60
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,471
that singled them out as Negroes.

61
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,810
Now, my book--

62
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,813
White Hatin' Coon--

63
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
don't have none of that bullshit.

64
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:01,110
The hero's name is Maleekwa,
a descendant from the black tribe...

65
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,155
that established the first society on the planet,

66
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,283
while you European motherfuckers
were still hidin' in caves and shit,

67
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,744
all terrified of the sun.

68
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,540
He's a strong role model that
a young black reader can look up to,

69
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,128
The chickens is comin' home to roost, y'all.

70
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,341
The black man's no longer gonna play the
minstrel in comics and sci-fi fantasy.

71
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:28,346
We keepin' it real, and we gonna
get respect by any means necessary.

72
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,766
Ah, come on!
That's a bunch of horseshit!

73
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,560
Lando Calrissian was a black guy, you know.

74
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,063
He got to fly the Millennium Falcon.
What's the matter with you?

75
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,774
- Who said that?
- I did.

76
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,153
Lando Calrissian is a positive role
model in science-fiction fantasy.

77
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,281
Fuck Lando Calrissian!
Uncle Tom nigger!

78
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,409
Always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy.

79
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,832
Those movies are about how the
white man keeps the brother man down...

80
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,918
even in a galaxy far, far away.

81
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,880
Check this shit. You got
cracker farm boy Luke Skywalker--

82
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,966
Nazi poster boy--
blond hair, blue eyes--

83
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,968
and then you got Darth Vader.

84
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,637
The blackest brother in the galaxy, Nubian guy.

85
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,307
- What's a Nubian?
- Shut the fuck up!

86
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,813
Now, Vader, he's a spiritual brother, you know.

87
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,107
Down with the force and all that good shit.

88
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,443
Then this cracker, Skywalker,
gets his hands on a light saber,

89
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,863
and the boy decides he's gonna run the fuckin' universe.

90
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,824
Gets a whole Klan of whites together.

91
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,952
And they gonna bust up Vader's hood, the Death Star.

92
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,954
Now, what the fuck do you call that?

93
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,332
- Intergalactic civil war?
- Gentrification!

94
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,838
They gonna drive out the black element...

95
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,008
to make the galaxy "safe" for white folks.

96
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,720
And Jedi's the most insulting installment!

97
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,390
Because Vader's beautiful black visage is sullied...

98
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,562
when he pulls off his mask to reveal
a feeble, crusty, old white man.

99
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:04,150
They're tryin' to tell us that deep
inside we all wants to be white!

100
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,820
Well, isn't that true?

101
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,456
Black rage!

102
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,666
Black rage!
I'll kill any white folks...

103
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,338
I lay my motherfuckin' eyes on!

104
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,533
"What's a Nubian?"
Bitch, you almost made me laugh.

105
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,327
Man, what about you? You didn't tell
me you were gonna scream, "Black rage!"

106
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,329
I nearly pissed myself.

107
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,331
How do you manage to get away with this all the time?

108
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,959
I mean, shouldn't the cops be busting
your head open right about now?

109
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,921
- Wrong coast.
- Well, this here, she full of blanks.

110
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:12,426
And, uh, Opiate gets all sorts
of legal clearances before I go on.

111
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,554
So your publisher actually condones these theatrics?

112
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:19,058
Condones? Honey, they insist. I need
to sell the image to sell the book.

113
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,352
Would the audience still buy the whole black rage angle...

114
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,231
if they found out the book
was written by a, a--you know.

115
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,817
- Faggot?
- When you say it, it sounds so sexy.

116
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,947
Hey, hey, hey! I'll play your victim,
but not your catcher, all right?

117
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,534
Hooper, how come you sound like Minister
Farrakhan when you're onstage...

118
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,620
and the king of pop when you're not?

119
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,622
Look out, boys!
This kitten has a whip!

120
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,624
Always before I get to speak, you dick.

121
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,751
I swear! Jesus!

122
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,713
The next con I attend, and they
ask me to be on the minority panel,

123
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,592
if I see your name anywhere near that list, I'm passing!

124
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,762
Holden, Banky, this pile
of P.M.S. is Alyssa Jones.

125
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,806
She does that book, Idiosyncratic Routine.

126
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,729
Oh, I've read your book. It's cute.
Chick stuff, but cute. What?

127
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,148
Sorry about him. He's, uh,
he's dealing with being an inker.

128
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,775
Oh. You trace.

129
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:15,239
I really like your book. I'm surprised
we never met at any other cons before.

130
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,825
Yeah, well, lose the dick or change the skin tone,

131
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,912
and we can get to know each other on panel after panel.

132
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,333
These boys do Bluntman & Chronic, which
outsells both of our books put together.

133
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,836
Hence, they're never on the panel with the likes of us.

134
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,630
They slummin' it right now.

135
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,966
I promised Alyssa
I'd buy her a post-rave drink.

136
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,344
Do the Garden Staters have
to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel,

137
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,222
or can you stay for a round in the big, scary city?

138
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,390
- We're gonna go--
- We'll take--

139
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,687
We'll go.

140
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,359
Archie. All right?

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,987
Archie and the Riverdale gang were
a pure and fun-lovin' bunch.

142
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,950
You can't find dysfunction in those
comics. They were flat-out wholesome.

143
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,869
- Archie and Jughead were lovers.
- Shut the fuck up!

144
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,207
It's true. Archie was the bitch,
and Jughead was the butch.

145
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,836
That's why Jughead wears
that crown-lookin' hat all the time.

146
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,964
He the king of Queen Archie's world.

147
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,966
Man, I feel a hate crime comin' on.

148
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,385
Well, you know, he does have a point.

149
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,512
I mean, Archie never did quite
settle on Betty or Veronica.

150
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,640
'Cause he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes!

151
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,060
He didn't choose one, because he was
trying to get them into a three-way.

152
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,522
- Here.
- What?

153
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,526
I want you to go down to the corner
store and buy yourself a clue.

154
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,028
- Go on.
- Eat it, Urkel.

155
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,198
Uh! I done told you to
watch it with that Urkel shit.

156
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,326
Face it, girl.
Archie's a sister.

157
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,208
- That's it. You!
- Moi?

158
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:53,129
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

159
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,923
and we're gonna pick up a shitload of Archie books.

160
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,885
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

161
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,470
that Archie is all about pussy.

162
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,472
Come on!

163
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,766
This boy is conflicted.

164
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,729
I shall play mother therapist for him.

165
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,065
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

166
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,779
Is he always like that?

167
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,116
Who, him? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

168
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,203
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know?

169
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,289
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

170
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,416
Father, Son, the Holy Spirit.

171
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,128
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge fight.

172
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,798
An eight-year-old kid?
How bad could it have been?

173
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,927
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag"?

174
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,971
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

175
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,016
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

176
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,479
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures?

177
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,316
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

178
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,902
Turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy though.

179
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,112
Can't tell you how many mornings after serious benders...

180
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,532
I'd wake up next to strange priests.

181
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,451
- Aren't you the sharp wit?
- Sharp? No.

182
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,496
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

183
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,626
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to first communion parties.

184
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,422
- Tsk.
- You play darts?

185
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:23,094
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

186
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,346
I don't know.

187
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,433
Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.

188
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,435
Your new book seems to be selling like mad.

189
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,232
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,611
"Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

191
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,030
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh!

192
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,076
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

193
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,579
pitying his good fortune.

194
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

195
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,211
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there?

196
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,131
No, I'm happy my stuff gets read at all.

197
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,383
There's very little market for hearts and flowers...

198
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,596
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns field.

199
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,765
If I sell two issues, I feel like John Grisham.

200
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,809
Well, it's all about marketing.

201
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:16,898
Over-or under-weight guys that don't get laid.
They're our bread and butter.

202
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,234
People like those two outside should be yours.

203
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,237
And sadly, there are more of our core audience.

204
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,908
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

205
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,285
And all over Banky's car, no less.

206
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,038
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

207
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,751
- Bubbly guy like that?
It's hard to figure out why.
- Yeah.

208
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,962
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean?

209
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,590
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

210
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,927
But, uh, you know, it's love.

211
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,971
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

212
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,016
That out there?
That's fleeting.

213
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,228
- Fleeting?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I gotta split.

214
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,940
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

215
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:03,819
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

216
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,953
Shut up already.

217
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,747
You shut up!
You're insane.

218
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,583
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee!

219
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,128
Deny, deny, deny.

220
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,174
- Where's Alyssa?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

221
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,927
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework!

222
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,304
Read between the lines, bitch.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,683
Fuck this. Let's go.
Traffic.

224
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,310
- Holden!
- What?

225
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,481
- Let's go!
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

226
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
Son of a bitch!

227
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,824
Let me guess.
You like her.

228
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,326
- Who?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

229
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,875
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

230
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,319
This is one of the best streetlights you've ever drawn.

231
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,529
It's the one from across the street from the post office.

232
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,365
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

233
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,869
So, uh, what do you want to do tonight?

234
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,331
I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch Degrassi Junior High.

235
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,125
You got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama.

236
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,836
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "aboot."

237
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,132
Bank Holdup.

238
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:53,429
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb fiends hate the city,

239
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,891
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

240
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,770
- Where is it?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

241
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,023
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

242
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,943
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

243
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,946
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who?

244
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,949
Alyssa.

245
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,992
Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

246
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,411
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that?

247
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,414
You got skill.
Yes, that one!

248
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,917
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say--

249
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,339
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 10:00. Later.

250
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:33,636
- Who was that?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

251
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,348
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn?
You like chicks.

252
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,476
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin'?

253
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,689
We? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

254
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,150
- And?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

255
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,612
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

256
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,990
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

257
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,161
How does one man get to be so funny?

258
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,623
Look, how you gonna get home when I hook up, huh?

259
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:07,086
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

260
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,505
The other night, we two, Alyssa and I,

261
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,008
we, uh, well, we shared a moment.

262
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,344
- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

263
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,139
We shared a moment, all right?

264
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:23,644
And in that moment, one thing was made abundantly clear.

265
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,148
This girl loves me, my friend.

266
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,943
Loves me. You know
what I'm sayin'?

267
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,487
Ah, who's your daddy now

268
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,865
Come on. Mmm.

269
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,867
- Ah
- Shut up!

270
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,704
It's your birthday It's your birthday

271
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:46,250
Go, Sheila, it's your birthday
Go, Sheila, it's your birthday

272
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,545
All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

273
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,216
Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?

274
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,385
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

275
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,263
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

276
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,058
Does his mother tell him everything?

277
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,852
- Hey!
- What'd you do, fall in love?

278
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,938
- Where is she?
- Over there.

279
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:12,109
Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin' for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.

280
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,154
She ain't no Deney Terrio, I'll say that.

281
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:19,200
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right?

282
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,912
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

283
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,665
- She got a boyfriend?
- Well, no.

284
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:30,044
Then what's to know, my friend?
What's to know?

285
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,265
Hey, lady! You fucked up
my cabbage patch!

286
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,853
Well, well, well, if it isn't Bluntman
himself, or should I call you Chronic?

287
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:51,065
Call me flattered. I heard you sent me
the invite to this little soiree.

288
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,819
From a former hometown girl
to Mr. Hometown himself.

289
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,530
- You're saying you're from the 'burbs?
- Middletown, New Jersey

290
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,908
- Get outta here! I'm from Highlands!
- I know. Hooper told me.

291
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,910
How is it that we never ran into one another?

292
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,912
- Did you graduate from Hudson?
- Yeah, '88.

293
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,040
- I went to North.
- What a small fuckin' world.

294
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,418
- So you know the tri-town area?
- Quiz me.

295
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,461
- Miller Hill?
- I wrote my name on the wall.

296
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,214
- Sandy Hook?
- Lost my virginity there.

297
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,593
- This is so cool. The mall?
- Eton preppy or Menlo Park?

298
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,929
Oh, no. Here's the big test.
Quick Stop?

299
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,932
My best friend fucked a dead guy in the bathroom.

300
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,060
- You know that girl?
- I did, before she was committed.

301
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,108
There's a lot of chicks in this place.

302
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,237
Chicks? You're such a man.

303
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,282
You know what this is?
This is fate.

304
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,536
No, this is "The Rog."

305
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,164
I'm talking about us meeting.
What are the chances?

306
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,959
Pretty slim. I haven't been back
to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

307
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,921
- The Quick Stop girl died?
- Uh-uh. Another girl.

308
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,548
- Julie Dwyer. She died in the--
- The YMCA pool! Damn!

309
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,884
- You knew her too?
- So well.

310
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,346
Wow! One friend in the asylum,
the other friend in the grave.

311
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,349
- You're a dangerous person to know.
- Ah, but I can tap.

312
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,354
- That's the Buffalo two-step.
- Yeah, well, it's very solid.

313
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,315
That's what six years of tap lessons yields.

314
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,693
Two towns away from each other
for years, we had to meet in New York.

315
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,280
Could have been worse.
Could have not met at all.

316
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,789
Okay, we're back.

317
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,958
Thank you. Thank you.

318
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,044
So, a long time ago, we used to have this bass player,

319
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,464
who took off one day to draw funny books or something.

320
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,634
Maybe you've heard of her stuff?
Idiosyncratic Routine?

321
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,348
But what a lot of people don't know...

322
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,351
is that she used to harbor
these delusions that she could sing,

323
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,480
and she used to subject us to throaty
renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes.

324
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,444
So, she's here tonight, and I think if we all beg her...

325
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,197
or maybe offer her some "X,"

326
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,825
she'll come up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings.

327
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,827
What do ya say, Alyssa?

328
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,872
Yeah!

329
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,542
Oh, she's shy!

330
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,503
Get up here and sing, bitch!

331
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:21,382
All right!
Go. Go up there.

332
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,384
Whoo!

333
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:27,722
Whoo! Yea!

334
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:32,351
What am I doing here?
This is so fucking gay.

335
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,942
She is such a cunt.

336
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,946
You guys know the one I wanna do, right?

337
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,116
All right. I should
dedicate this, right?

338
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:53,206
This is for that someone special out there.

339
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,708
Ready?

340
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:00,421
I'm feelin' awful

341
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,841
But all alone

342
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:08,429
Just missin' someone

343
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,225
I don't even know

344
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,937
But until I find him

345
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:19,899
I'll wait patiently

346
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,737
Just feelin' nothin'

347
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,615
Inside of me

348
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:31,577
And where are you, baby

349
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,580
Where can you be

350
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:39,377
Why aren't you here

351
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,463
Lovin' me

352
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:46,259
'Cause I want to kiss you

353
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,346
And make you feel right

354
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,975
I want to lay with you

355
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,311
All through the night

356
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:01,148
And I wanna feel passion I wanna feel pain

357
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,777
I wanna weep at the sound of your name

358
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,322
Come make me laugh or come make me cry

359
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:15,329
Just make me feel alive

360
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,083
And so I'll wait

361
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,712
For that glorious day

362
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,965
When the one I dream of

363
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:30,511
Comes my way

364
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,098
And when our lips touch

365
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,935
So tenderly

366
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,273
I know I'll feel somethin'

367
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:48,112
Inside of me

368
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:52,450
I wanna feel passion I wanna feel pain

369
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,037
I wanna weep at the sound of your name

370
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,499
Come make me laugh or come make me cry

371
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:03,794
Just make me feel

372
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,173
Alive

373
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,887
Yeah! Whoo!

374
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,185
Whoo!

375
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,566
Hot!

376
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:15,491
Now, that, my friend, is a shared moment.

377
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,342
- What?
- It's rude.

378
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:37,096
When are we gonna get a chance to see
this shit live without payin' for it?

379
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,603
- Sorry. It's just new to him.
- Oh, and you're an old hand at this?

380
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:48,733
No, no, I should apologize. I don't
normally get all mushy in public,

381
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,861
but it's been a while since I've seen Kim here.

382
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,280
You know what?
I wanna dance.

383
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,699
Go ahead.
I'll watch from here.

384
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,410
No!
I wanna dance with you!

385
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:03,956
Don't be a rag. I have to sit here and
work up the desire to fuck you later.

386
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,461
Please!

387
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,300
Yes?

388
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,719
You said "fuck."
She said "fuck."

389
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,096
You said "fuck" to that girl.
You said that you'd fuck her.

390
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,933
- And?
- How can a girl fuck another girl?

391
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,935
Were you talking about
strap-ons or something?

392
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,937
- Oh, Jesus. Would you shut up?
- What?

393
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,396
It's okay.

394
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,274
I don't know how many times I can apologize for him.

395
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,903
No, Banky, I've never
used a strap-on.

396
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,905
Then what's with saying "fuck"?

397
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,618
Shouldn't you say "eat her out" or
modify the term "fuck" with "fist"?

398
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,831
Let me ask you a question.
Can men fuck each other?

399
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,918
- You asking for my permission?
- In your estimation.

400
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,003
Sure.

401
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,549
So, for you, to fuck is to penetrate.

402
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,510
You're used to the more traditional definition.

403
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,305
You, inside some girl you've duped, jackhammerin' away,

404
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,349
not noticing that bored look in her eyes.

405
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,979
Hey, I always notice that bored look
in their eyes, all right?

406
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,524
Fucking is not limited to penetration, Banky.

407
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:16,028
For me, it describes any sex
when it's not totally about love.

408
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,031
I don't love Kim, but I'll fuck her.

409
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,033
I'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with.

410
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,161
Some of them I downright loathe.

411
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,664
Aha, but I'll bet it's different
with the ones you do love.

412
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,666
Like, you'll go down on 'em longer.

413
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,334
- Here we go.
- I don't do that.

414
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,588
- What?
- I stopped. It got to be frustrating.

415
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,300
As stupid as you usually come off
during this little diatribe of yours,

416
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,468
you're gonna come off ten times
as stupid on this occasion.

417
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,513
I lost my tolerance for the baggage
that comes with eating girls out.

418
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,515
What's the big deal?

419
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,351
If you say the smell, so help me, I will slug you.

420
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,437
Not the smell.
The smell is good.

421
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,190
I'm talkin' about not being able to do it properly.

422
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,192
My mother brought me up to believe...

423
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,986
if I can't do something right, I shouldn't do it at all.

424
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,573
Of course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the point.

425
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,076
Well, at least you blame yourself
for your sexual inadequacies.

426
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,370
No. I blame them.

427
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:11,209
Chicks never help you out.
They never tell you what to do, right?

428
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,879
And most of them are all self-conscious
about the smell factor.

429
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:19,425
And, so, most of the time, they just lay
there frozen like a deer in headlights.

430
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,136
I mean, not for nothin', but when a chick goes down on me,

431
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,306
I let her know where to go and what the status is.

432
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,393
You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel.

433
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,604
Constant updates.

434
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,856
You are such an idiot.

435
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,401
No, no, he's got a point.
I mean, that's how I was in high school.

436
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:41,072
You know, all nervous and inhibited about being eaten out.

437
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,617
But by the time I got to college, that all changed.

438
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,786
I've loosened up.

439
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,413
I was like one of those guys at
the airport with those big flashlights,

440
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:53,417
wavin' 'em this way, directin' 'em
that way, tellin' 'em when to stop.

441
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,921
And that's all I'm sayin'. It would
be different if chicks helped out.

442
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,465
You know, pointed a guy in the right direction.

443
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:04,971
There'd be no bullshit, no wasted time
and no chance for permanent injuries.

444
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,973
Permanent injuries?

445
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,601
Sure. You wanna see
somethin' permanent?

446
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,812
- See that?
- Uh-huh.

447
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,648
I got that from Nina Rollins, sophomore year.

448
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,650
I'm goin' down on her, right?

449
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,986
Out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her.

450
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:25,449
She does this big pelvic thrust, cracks
my tooth and sends it down my throat.

451
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,494
I had to get a crown for the stub.

452
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,957
I got that beat.
I got that beat.

453
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:37,879
Junior year, I'm goin' down
on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room.

454
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:43,176
I'm totally drunk, and in the middle
of it, I fall asleep right in her lap.

455
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,178
She got so mad, she digs her heel into my back.

456
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:49,515
- Ow!
- Right there. That's permanent.

457
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,311
All right. All right.
See this?

458
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,857
That's the farthest I can move my neck to the right.

459
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,028
Again, sophomore year, I'm goin' out with Brandy Svining.

460
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,907
And for six months, I'm goin' down
on her. Not a damn thing's happening.

461
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,702
So, one night, I change a position
or vary my lapping speed,

462
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,956
and suddenly it's a whole new world.

463
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,001
She's movin' around, convulsing, breathing heavy,

464
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,712
and her legs are pressed up against my ears so tightly...

465
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:23,674
that I don't hear her father come into the room.

466
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,844
He grabs my hair and pulls me way back, hard.

467
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,727
Senior year, spring formal.

468
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,730
I'm eatin' out Missy Kurt in her brother's car.

469
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:42,276
She's layin' across the backseat. I'm
half hangin' out, knees on the ground.

470
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,240
She's flailin' around, and she--
she knocks the parking brake off.

471
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:51,702
The car starts rolling down the hill.

472
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:54,914
And my left knee is cut up to shit...

473
00:31:54,997 --> 00:32:00,586
like a kiddy's scissors class cut it up for paper dolls!

474
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,770
Whoa! Hey!
Look at the time.

475
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,772
We gotta-- We gotta
beat that traffic, huh?

476
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,108
What traffic?
It's 1:30 in the morning.

477
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,695
And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.

478
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:30,074
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

479
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,076
Come on.

480
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,167
Since you like chicks, right,

481
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,919
you just look at yourself naked
in the mirror all the time?

482
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,139
Look, here's the deal.

483
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,600
When we get in there, don't be a
complete Potzer, like last night.

484
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,643
This is business now, okay?

485
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:02,023
Oh, why are you in such a bad mood?
Still dwelling on that dyke?

486
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,233
- Hey, knock it off, will you?
- What'd I tell you?

487
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,819
She just needs the right guy.

488
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:11,741
All every woman really wants
is some serious deep-dicking.

489
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,328
Sorry.

490
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,874
See, that's why I can't buy lesbians.

491
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,126
Everyone needs dick.

492
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,837
See, I can buy fags, a bunch of guys that need dick.

493
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,757
You know, just plain need it.
That I get.

494
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,677
Dykes?
Bullshit posturing.

495
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,096
But, live and let live, I guess.

496
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,016
I'm sure the gay community appreciates your support.

497
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:41,020
We'd like to start off by saying that it
is a real pleasure to finally meet you.

498
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,356
Absolute pleasure.

499
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,275
One of the reasons we started this whole
thing was to finally meet the guys...

500
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,694
that do Bluntman & Chronic.

501
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,738
- Snootchie bootchies!
- Huh?

502
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,158
Which now brings us to our proposal.

503
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,911
Look, fellas, the days
of Butt-Head are over.

504
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:01,666
We're interested in doing 12 half-hour
Bluntman & Chronic cartoons.

505
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,293
What do you say?

506
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,879
Are we in business?

507
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,593
The boy wonder.

508
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:17,390
Batman and Robin, the dynamic
duo against crime and corruption.

509
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,393
Yeah, hi. Somebody told me
they make comic books here,

510
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:24,063
which is so weird, because I have
this great idea for a story.

511
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,358
It's about a guy who comes
to this club and--

512
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,527
hightails it
when he finds out--

513
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,195
Ready for this?

514
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,242
This girl is gay.

515
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:42,415
Any interest in a story like that?

516
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,625
- An animated series?
- Twelve episodes.

517
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,087
- Well, that's great, isn't it?
- Banky seems to think so.

518
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,715
- But you don't.
- Well, I--

519
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,759
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our work.

520
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,928
I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but...

521
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,139
I'd like to think of us as artists, you know?

522
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,267
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our first book.

523
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,770
Well, when are you gonna do that?

524
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:08,232
When we have something personal to say.

525
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,776
I weirded you out the other night.

526
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,613
Uh, no, not really.

527
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:16,699
- Oh, come on!
- Well, it's just--

528
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,993
I'd never seen that kind of thing
up close and personal before.

529
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,037
It just took a while to process.

530
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,122
You wanna talk about it?

531
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,291
If you want to.

532
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:28,169
I like you, Holden.

533
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,546
I haven't liked a man in a long time.

534
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,301
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

535
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,971
It's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...

536
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:42,600
immediately live into a stereotype of some sort.

537
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,311
And I want you to feel comfortable with me,

538
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,356
because I'd really like us to be friends.

539
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:51,859
So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

540
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,154
- Okay.
- Okay.

541
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,491
Okay. Why girls?

542
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:03,412
- Why men?
- Well, because that's the standard.

543
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,499
If that's the only reason
you're attracted to women--

544
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,668
No, it's more than that.

545
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,837
So you've never been curious about men?

546
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,383
Curious? Well, I always wondered
why my father watched Hee Haw, but--

547
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,677
- You know what I mean.
- No.

548
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,679
- Why not?
- No interest.

549
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,515
- Because?
- Girls feel right.

550
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:26,894
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

551
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:30,523
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then?
- No.

552
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,525
But you've only been with girls.

553
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,527
So you're saying a person is a virgin...

554
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:37,572
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

555
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,949
Isn't that the standard definition?

556
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,160
Again with your standards.

557
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:45,621
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the first time.

558
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,499
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why? Why only then?

559
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,502
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya?

560
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:55,840
So if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin?

561
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,384
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

562
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,762
So she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex.

563
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,640
Hence, according to your definition,
she'd still be a virgin.

564
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:07,518
- Okay, fine, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

565
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,688
Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken.

566
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,983
- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really?

567
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,653
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

568
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,781
Okay. Second revision.

569
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,493
Virginity is lost through penetration.

570
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,953
Physical penetration or emotional.

571
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,955
- Emotional penetration?
- Mmm.

572
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,083
I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree
when we were in high school.

573
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,251
Physical penetration.

574
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:35,004
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

575
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,092
I move to have that remark stricken from the record,

576
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:44,263
on account of it makes you come off
as completely naive and infantile.

577
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,558
Well, where's the penetration
in lesbian sex? I--

578
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:52,188
A finger? I've had my finger up my
ass. I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.

579
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,192
Observe.

580
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:04,033
You're kidding me!
How?

581
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,786
Our bodies are built to pass a child, for Christ's sake.

582
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,372
Yeah, but I mean-- Jesus!
Doesn't that hurt?

583
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,750
- Sure, but in that good way.
- Oh.

584
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:16,879
And it's only a once-in-a-while thing
reserved for really special occasions.

585
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:21,050
- How about not-so-special occasions?
- Tongue only.

586
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,387
Well, but see-- Come on.
That's what I'm sayin'.

587
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,723
It's like, how can that be enough?
How big can a tongue really get?

588
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,646
My God.

589
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:38,484
Let's go.

590
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,197
Come on. Come on.

591
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,741
You're really gonna have to give me a minute, I think.

592
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,703
Would you stop futzing with
your fuckin' bag? We're late already.

593
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,945
- I have to get something.
- Look, man, we miss this train,

594
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:54,542
I'm gonna shitcan you and just hire Charles Schulz.

595
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,920
Oh, my God. Who are you?
Larry Fucking Flynt?

596
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:00,631
- What are you gonna do with all those?
- Read the articles.

597
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:04,552
What do you think I'm gonna do
with 'em? They're stroke books, stupid.

598
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,638
You got, like, 30 books in there.
We're only gonna be gone for two days.

599
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:10,558
Variety is the spice of life.
I like a wide selection.

600
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,894
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for nasty close-ups.

601
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,229
Sometimes I like 'em arty and airbrushed.

602
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,565
Sometimes it's a spread
brown-eye kind of night.

603
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:20,067
Sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.

604
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,069
Sometimes a steamy letter will do.

605
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:25,072
Sometimes, not often, but sometimes...

606
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:29,410
I like the idea of a chick with a horse.

607
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,954
Go get our tickets.
I gotta call Alyssa.

608
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,790
- His master's voice.
- Put that stuff away!

609
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,052
Hi.

610
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,740
One minute, five seconds.
Ah, you are such my bitch.

611
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,742
What's up?
I'm about to get on a train.

612
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,995
- Oh! Why?
- Last-minute invite to the Boston Con.

613
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,916
- Shit.
- What?

614
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,627
Well, my sister's at my parents',
and I was gonna go see her.

615
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,671
- The one that wrote the book?
- Yeah.

616
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:26,300
But I was stayin' all weekend. I
wanted to hang out with you. This sucks.

617
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:30,596
You know, um, both of us don't have to go.

618
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,640
- Really?
- Yeah. Banky can do this by himself.

619
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,893
I mean, you know, it's not like we're on
a panel. It's just a signing appearance.

620
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,729
If you come pick me up, I'll be your best friend.

621
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,023
Where's your apartment?

622
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:45,027
And then Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer,

623
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:50,575
and he finally did some of his own mounting.

624
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:52,618
What are you doing?

625
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,829
I think I want kids of my own
one day. They're fun.

626
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:58,291
Listen to me. I'm not going. You're
gonna have to do this one by yourself.

627
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:00,334
- What? Why?
- Alyssa's comin' down for the weekend.

628
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:02,879
I'm gonna hang out with her.
You don't need me for this.

629
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,923
Look, I'll take the bags.
You can, uh, keep the filth.

630
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,925
I'll pick you up
at 9:00 Sunday night.

631
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,887
Don't forget to plug the annual,
and don't mention the TV show, okay?

632
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:13,431
Call me if you get bored.

633
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,474
All aboard!

634
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,354
Explain this again.

635
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,899
How could you have grown up
on the shore and never played skee-ball?

636
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,942
What did you do with your youth?

637
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,445
Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around.

638
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,614
Not your grade school years, your high school years.

639
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:33,201
- This looks complicated.
- Jesus. Potzer, uh--

640
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:35,912
- The premise is very basic, okay?
- Uh-huh.

641
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:39,123
You roll the ball up the rampart in an
effort to pop it into the score circle.

642
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:40,750
The higher the score, the more prize tickets you get.

643
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,793
Well, what do you do with the prize tickets?

644
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:45,296
You trade them in for prizes,

645
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:48,466
which are not worth nearly as much
as you've paid to play the game.

646
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,844
- Well, what's the point?
- It's fun.

647
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:54,764
And you question my lifestyle.

648
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:58,017
Observe.

649
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,483
See? It's just that simple.

650
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,194
Well, why not just walk up there
and put it in the 50 every time--

651
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:12,448
- Well, where's the skill in that?
- Oh, this is a skill.

652
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,867
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

653
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,869
Just toss one.

654
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:26,504
Uh, I'm sorry there, man.
She's a little new at this.

655
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,048
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

656
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,717
Underhand, okay?
Throw it underhand.

657
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:34,345
And this is where you take straight chicks on dates.

658
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,347
This place is like Spanish fly.

659
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,766
This will probably be the first time
I don't score afterward.

660
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,769
I don't know. I'm starting to get
a tingle in my bottom.

661
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,941
- Ten.
- Very nice.

662
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,943
- So, what'd you do last night?
- Got laid.

663
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:56,742
Some more of that, uh, skill you were tellin' me about?

664
00:42:56,784 --> 00:43:00,413
I never will regret this

665
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,999
I never will, never will Never will regret this

666
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:05,001
Never will regret this

667
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:09,589
I never will, never will Never will regret this

668
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:22,643
Well, give us today and I'm not scared to say

669
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,563
I'm afraid

670
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,274
Yes, I have a couple of hesitations

671
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,651
And I'll open the door

672
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:35,072
And I wonder if she might come in

673
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:40,453
And do you really need an invitation now

674
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:44,624
'Cause I think I'm feeling really something today

675
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:48,920
Yes, I think I feel a little spark, hey

676
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:51,964
Are you sure that control is working, Banky?

677
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:55,468
I thought you lived in the city.

678
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,470
It's like the umpteenth time I've seen ya here.

679
00:43:57,512 --> 00:44:00,848
Isn't that grounds for the little pink
mafia to throw you outta their club?

680
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:02,808
Hey! That's
the last time.

681
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,646
I think I feel a little spark, hey

682
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:10,066
A little jump start Never will forget this

683
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,069
I never will, never will Never will forget this

684
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:15,488
Never will forget this

685
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,282
I never will, never will Never will forget this

686
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:20,535
Never will forget this

687
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:23,329
I never will, never will Never will forget this

688
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,623
Never will forget this

689
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,959
I never will, never will Never will forget this

690
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:37,385
Wow. How bad do you suck?

691
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:41,472
How was your pseudo date?

692
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:43,641
- Leave it alone.
- That chick bugs me.

693
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:47,270
- No, everyone bugs you.
- Get off!

694
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,898
Fuckin' faggot. Did you see that?

695
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:55,486
Your dyke-courting ass
just got me scored on.

696
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,406
You know, you should watch that, man.

697
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:01,242
If you're gonna get so bent
outta shape while playing the game--

698
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:04,370
so much so that you feel
the need to curse the TV--

699
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:06,747
try not to gay bash it, all right?

700
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:09,000
You're not that kind of guy.

701
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:13,880
And don't call her a dyke.
She's a lesbian. Okay?

702
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,806
What the fuck is goin' on here?

703
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,184
- I'm starting a new page?
- Not with this shit! With you!

704
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:28,227
What the fuck is goin' on with you and that girl?

705
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:31,439
- We're just friends!
- She's programming you!

706
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,441
I beg your pardon?
Programming?

707
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,027
Yeah, and apparently you don't even fuckin' realize it.

708
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,821
What does it matter if I refer to her as a dyke?

709
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:42,575
Or if I call the Whalers faggots
in the privacy of my own office...

710
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:45,495
far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world?

711
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:49,207
Look, man, it's
passive-aggressive gay bashing.

712
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,292
And I know you're not really prejudiced at heart.

713
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:57,298
I think you should find some other way
to express your anger is all I'm saying.

714
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:12,271
What are you doing?

715
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:18,069
Just bear with me here. I want to
put you through this little exercise.

716
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:29,664
All right, now, see this?
This is a four-way road, okay?

717
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:34,252
And dead in the center is a crisp,
new hundred-dollar bill.

718
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:38,339
Now, at the end of each of these streets
are four people. Okay? You following?

719
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,341
- Yeah.
- Good.

720
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,594
Over here we have a male-affectionate,
easy-to-get-along-with,

721
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,472
nonpolitical-agenda
lesbian.

722
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:50,476
Down here we have
a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,

723
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,021
agenda-of-rage,
bitter dyke.

724
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:58,943
Over here we got Santa Claus,
and up here, the Easter Bunny.

725
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:03,614
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first?

726
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:05,616
- What is this supposed to prove?
- No, I'm serious.

727
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,703
This is a serious exercise.
It's like an S.A.T. question.

728
00:47:08,786 --> 00:47:11,873
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first?

729
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:14,834
The male-friendly lesbian?
The man-hating dyke?

730
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:16,836
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?

731
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:19,630
- The man-hating dyke.
- Good.

732
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,632
- Why?
- I don't know.

733
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:25,636
Because the other three are figments
of your fucking imagination!

734
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,764
I don't need this. I'll be hiding
from your fuckin' shit in my room.

735
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:31,517
- What?
- What is it about this girl, man?

736
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:34,353
You know you have no shot at getting her into bed!

737
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,856
Why do you bother wasting time with her?

738
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:39,901
- Because you're Holden Fucking McNeil.
- Right.

739
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:44,530
Most persistent traveler on the road.
That's not the path of least resistance.

740
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:47,033
Everything's gotta be a fuckin' challenge for you.

741
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,452
And this little relationship with that bitch...

742
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:52,538
is a prime example of your fucking condition.

743
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,916
Well, I don't need a magic eight ball
to look into your future.

744
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:59,795
You want a forecast? Here.
Will Holden ever fuck Alyssa?

745
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:02,840
Oh, what a shock.
Not fucking likely.

746
00:48:02,924 --> 00:48:06,928
This relationship is affecting you,
our work and our friendship.

747
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:10,556
The time's gonna come when I throw down
the gauntlet and say, "It's me or her."

748
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,600
- Then what are you gonna say?
- I say you should let this one go!

749
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:16,521
No. What would you say? Would you
trash 20 years of fuckin' friendship...

750
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:18,856
because you've got some idiotic notion...

751
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,360
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?

752
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:25,613
Look, fuckin' asshole,
I'm telling you, okay? Let it go!

753
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:27,657
What the fuck, man?

754
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,700
What the fuck makes this bitch all that important?

755
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:32,954
'Cause I'm fuckin' in love with her, man, okay?

756
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:41,212
Fuck.

757
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:51,180
- Well, I thought it was love
- Thought it was love

758
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:53,432
'Cause my heart--

759
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:00,439
Wish you were the one being pursued for the cartoon.

760
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,108
Oh, really?

761
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:06,320
Yeah, then maybe you could sell out and
pick up a check every once in a while.

762
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:08,322
We're leaving?

763
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:11,325
Well, it's not like this is a bed and breakfast.

764
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:14,203
I've got a little business to conduct.

765
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:24,046
Hello there.
Let me ask you a question.

766
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,551
Are you an authorized deal maker in this establishment?

767
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,554
Do you have the power to negotiate?

768
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,557
You wanna haggle over the price of your French dip?

769
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,979
No, I wanna haggle over the price of fine art.

770
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:43,149
- What do you mean?
- There. By the kitchen.

771
00:49:43,232 --> 00:49:46,486
See? That painting.

772
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:50,948
- What about it?
- The price tag says 75.

773
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:54,202
- So?
- Tell me you're kidding.

774
00:49:54,243 --> 00:49:58,748
I'll give you 50.

775
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:08,007
Manuel, could you bring the Dyksiezski
down off the wall, please?

776
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:10,801
My new Dyksiezski.

777
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:14,764
- Where are you gonna hang it?
- I'm not. You are.

778
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,766
Oh? You want me
to hang it for you?

779
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,768
You better hope it doesn't get out to the girl nation...

780
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,770
you needed a man to help you hang a picture.

781
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:24,690
No, no, no. You're going
to hang it in your house.

782
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:28,194
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

783
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:36,452
- Why?
- Because it's captured the moment.

784
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:39,372
It'll be a constant reminder, not just of tonight,

785
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:44,085
but of our introduction, of the building
of our friendship, everything.

786
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:48,673
Make no mistake about it, my friend,
it is a gift from me to you,

787
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:52,009
so you'll always remember us.

788
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,691
Why are we stopping?

789
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,986
- Because I can't take this.
- Can't take what?

790
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:12,697
I love you.

791
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:21,998
You love me?

792
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:25,835
I love you and not, not in a friendly way.

793
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:28,045
Although, I think we're great friends.

794
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:31,507
And not in a misplaced affection, puppy dog way.

795
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,676
Although, I'm sure that's what you'll call it.

796
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,221
I love you. Very--

797
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,600
Very simple.
Very truly.

798
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:45,480
You are the epitome of everything I have
ever looked for in another human being.

799
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:47,565
And I know that you think of me as just a friend,

800
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:50,109
and crossing that line is the furthest
thing from an option...

801
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,028
you would ever consider,

802
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:56,991
but--
I had to say it.

803
00:51:57,074 --> 00:51:59,076
I just--
I can't take this anymore.

804
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:02,163
I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you.

805
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,624
I can't-- I can't look into
your eyes without feeling that--

806
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:07,752
that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels.

807
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:13,508
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you are.

808
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:19,055
And I know this will probably queer
our friendship-- no pun intended--

809
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:24,769
but I had to say it.

810
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,272
'Cause I've never felt this way before.

811
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:33,736
And I don't care.
I like who I am because of it.

812
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,198
And if bringing this to light
means we can't hang out anymore,

813
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:40,451
then that hurts me.

814
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:42,995
But, God, I just-- I couldn't
allow another day to go by...

815
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:46,958
without just getting it out there,
regardless of the outcome,

816
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:52,547
which, by the look on your face,
is to be the inevitable...

817
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,341
shoot down.

818
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:00,680
And, you know, I'll accept that.

819
00:53:00,763 --> 00:53:04,600
But I know-- I know that some part
of you is hesitating for a moment.

820
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:08,354
And if there's a moment of hesitation,
then that means you feel something too.

821
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:10,356
And all I ask, please,
is that you just--

822
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:15,862
you just not dismiss that and try
to dwell in it for just ten seconds.

823
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:19,157
Ah.

824
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:22,743
Alyssa.

825
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:28,332
There isn't another soul on this fucking planet...

826
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:32,795
who has ever made me half the person
I am when I'm with you.

827
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:36,966
And I would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau,

828
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:39,093
because it is there between you and me.

829
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:42,972
You can't deny that.

830
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:54,567
Even if, you know--

831
00:53:58,112 --> 00:54:02,074
Even if we never talk again after tonight,

832
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:06,621
please know that I am forever changed...

833
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:11,083
because of who you are and what you've meant to me,

834
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:15,254
which, while I do appreciate it,

835
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:20,885
I'd never need a painting of birds
bought at a diner to remind me of.

836
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:38,778
Oh, God.

837
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:42,323
Was it something I said?

838
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:45,284
Fuck.

839
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:52,917
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car and get outta here!

840
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,211
- You're gonna hitch to New York?
- Yep!

841
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:58,464
- Aren't you at least gonna comment?
- Fuck you!

842
00:54:58,548 --> 00:55:00,508
- Why?
- That was so unfair.

843
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:01,968
You know how unfair that was.

844
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:03,970
What? It's unfair
that I'm in love with you?

845
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:06,514
No, it's unfortunate that you're in love with me.

846
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:10,017
It's unfair you felt the fuckin' need
to unburden your soul about it.

847
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:13,312
Do you remember for one fucking second who I am?

848
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,731
So? I mean, you know,
people change.

849
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:17,733
Oh! Oh!
It's that simple!

850
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:20,611
You fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship.

851
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:22,613
Nothing changes for you...

852
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:25,158
with the exception of feeling
hunky-dory all the time.

853
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:29,203
But what about me, Holden?
It's not that simple!

854
00:55:29,245 --> 00:55:31,664
I just can't get into a relationship with you...

855
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:34,834
without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval.

856
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:39,172
That's every relationship. There's
always gonna be a period of adjustment.

857
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:41,799
Period of adjustment?

858
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:46,179
There's no period of adjustment,
Holden! I am fucking gay!

859
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:48,306
That's who I am!

860
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:54,270
You assume I can turn all that around
because you've got a fucking crush?

861
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:58,274
If this is a crush,

862
00:55:58,357 --> 00:56:02,028
I don't think I could take it
if the real thing ever happened.

863
00:56:02,111 --> 00:56:04,572
Go home, Holden.

864
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:37,303
You're back with Chaz and Stu and the New Zoo Review.

865
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:41,307
As always behind us we got wacky--

866
00:57:59,992 --> 00:58:02,745
I take it that's not good.

867
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:06,332
Stay here.

868
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:10,002
Be right back.

869
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:32,316
Catholic schoolgirls.

870
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:37,446
The uniform's what does it for me.

871
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,367
I wish I'd went with more
Catholic schoolgirls when I was a kid.

872
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:46,956
As it stands, I have no "And then she
unzipped her jumper" stories.

873
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,335
You seemed
weirded-out back there.

874
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:55,965
- That's my couch you were fucking on.
- Sorry.

875
00:58:56,048 --> 00:58:59,343
I wanted to watch some TV.
Hard to do when your best friend is...

876
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:03,514
wrapped around a naked
rug-muncher on your couch.

877
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:06,100
She had boxers on.

878
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:14,066
- This is all gonna end badly.
- You don't know that.

879
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,820
I know you. You're way
too conservative for that girl.

880
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:22,408
She's been around and seen things
we've only read about in books.

881
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:26,245
We have read about them, so we're prepared.

882
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:29,582
There's no "we" here.

883
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,878
You're gonna have to go through this alone.

884
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,921
It's one thing to read about shit,

885
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:40,092
something different when you're forced
to deal with it on a regular basis.

886
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:43,971
When you are walking in a mall and your
heads turn at a nice-looking chick,

887
00:59:44,054 --> 00:59:47,099
it's gonna eat you up inside.

888
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:51,729
You'll spend most of your time wondering
when the other shoe's gonna drop.

889
00:59:51,812 --> 00:59:55,858
'Cause for you this isn't about cool, weird sex stuff.

890
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:58,194
It's about love.

891
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:01,405
Maybe it is for her as well.

892
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:04,700
Somehow I doubt it.

893
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:07,620
Everybody's not out to get someone in life, Bank.

894
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:11,540
Everybody has an agenda,
all right? Everyone.

895
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:13,250
Yourself?

896
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:16,253
- My agenda is to watch your back.
- To what end?

897
01:00:16,295 --> 01:00:19,256
To insure that all this time we've
spent together, building something,

898
01:00:19,298 --> 01:00:20,424
wasn't wasted.

899
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:24,553
Oh, she's not gonna ruin the comic.

900
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:29,642
I wasn't talkin' about the comic.

901
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:34,480
I'm gonna go get a bagel.

902
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:38,234
Clean off my fucking couch so I can watch TV.

903
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:51,330
From what I understand, when you sign with a publisher...

904
01:00:51,372 --> 01:00:54,166
someone else does all this work for you,
and you just sit back and collect.

905
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,628
And miss these late-night cram sessions
with my nearest and dearest?

906
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,089
- Never.
- I don't know what she's bitching about.

907
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,758
All she's done since we got here is pound Merlot.

908
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:03,926
Yeah, you're a real help.

909
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:06,679
I'd like to know why we're here at all...

910
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,681
when we haven't seen Princess Funny Book in a month.

911
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:13,686
- Yeah. Who you shackin' up with?
- "Shacking up with"? Please.

912
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:17,648
I'm so in love!

913
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:19,942
Ohh!

914
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:24,363
I know, I know. I feel like such a goon,
but I can't help it.

915
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,366
- We have such a great time together.
- Who is it?

916
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,368
Someone you guys don't know.

917
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,454
That chick you left the restaurant with that night.

918
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,456
They're not from around here.

919
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:35,458
Don't even tell me you met her down the shore.

920
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:38,210
Ew, a bridge-and-tunnel
Jersey dyke.

921
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:40,796
With huge hair and acid-washed jeans.

922
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,884
For your information, they don't have
big hair or wear acid-wash.

923
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,969
They're from my hometown.

924
01:01:51,766 --> 01:01:53,893
Why are you playing the pronoun game?

925
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,730
- What are you talking about? I'm not.
- You are.

926
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:03,152
I met "someone." "We" have a great
time. "They're" from my hometown.

927
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:05,404
Doesn't this tube of wonderful have a name?

928
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,872
Holden.

929
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,555
Well...

930
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:36,352
here's to the both of you.

931
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,566
Another one bites the dust.

932
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:53,744
Can I ask you a question?

933
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:57,540
Don't even tell me you want to do it again.

934
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:04,255
Why me?
You know? Why now?

935
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:07,800
Well, because you were givin' me
that look and I got all wet.

936
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:10,094
You know what I mean.

937
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:12,638
Why not you?

938
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:17,852
Well, I'm a guy. I mean...
you're attracted to girls.

939
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:20,479
I see you've been taking notes.

940
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:23,732
Historically, yes.
That's true.

941
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:26,610
Then why this?

942
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:34,493
Well, I've given that a lot of thought, you know.

943
01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:37,538
Now that I'm being ostracized by my friends,

944
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,540
I've had plenty of time to think about it.

945
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:43,002
And what I've come up with is really simple.

946
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:47,715
I came to this on my own terms.

947
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:50,718
You know, I didn't just heed what I was taught:

948
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,638
Men and women should be together, it's the natural way,

949
01:03:54,722 --> 01:03:56,640
that kind of thing.

950
01:03:56,724 --> 01:04:00,936
I'm not with you because of what family, society, life...

951
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,523
tried to instill in me from day one.

952
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,819
The way the world is,

953
01:04:08,903 --> 01:04:13,908
how seldom it is that you meet that one person who...

954
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:16,535
just gets you.

955
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,038
It's so rare.

956
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,208
My parents didn't really have it.

957
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:27,713
There were no examples set for me in
the world of male-female relationships.

958
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,967
And to cut oneself off
from finding that person--

959
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:36,388
to immediately halve your options
by eliminating the possibility...

960
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,142
of finding that one person
within your own gender--

961
01:04:40,226 --> 01:04:42,353
that just seemed stupid to me.

962
01:04:42,436 --> 01:04:45,272
So I didn't.

963
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,567
But then you came along.

964
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:52,571
You, the one least likely.
I mean, you were a guy.

965
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,116
Still am.

966
01:04:55,157 --> 01:05:00,246
And while I was falling for you I put a ceiling on that,

967
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,124
because you were a guy.

968
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:08,045
Until I remembered why I opened the door
to women in the first place:

969
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:12,425
To not limit the likelihood
of finding that one person who'd...

970
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:14,844
complement me so completely.

971
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,268
So, here we are.

972
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:24,687
I was thorough when I looked for you.

973
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:30,401
And I feel justified lying in your arms...

974
01:05:30,484 --> 01:05:34,196
'cause I got here on my own terms,

975
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:39,034
and I have no question there was someplace I didn't look.

976
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:41,829
For me that makes all the difference.

977
01:05:58,053 --> 01:06:01,140
Can I at least tell people all you
needed was some serious deep-dicking?

978
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:10,608
- Move!
- Stop!

979
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:26,415
- What?
- Check out page 48.

980
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,514
- So?
- Did you see the nickname?

981
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,644
- "Finger Cuffs."
- And?

982
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:51,148
- Weird nickname. What's your point?
- Do you know why it's "Finger Cuffs"?

983
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:54,485
- No. I suppose you do.
- I do.

984
01:06:57,071 --> 01:07:01,659
Remember Cohee Lundin? Left Hudson
and went to North our senior year?

985
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:03,661
Yeah.

986
01:07:03,744 --> 01:07:06,914
Well, asshole, I ran into him at the stores the other day.

987
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:09,458
God, it's been ages since I've seen him.

988
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,003
- Mentioned you were dating Alyssa.
- Did you?

989
01:07:13,087 --> 01:07:15,339
Yeah. Funny thing is,
you know what he said?

990
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:20,177
Shit, I know Alyssa Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones.

991
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:24,306
Me and Rick Derris used to hang
around her house after school...

992
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,017
and shit, 'cause her parents were,
like, never home and shit, right?

993
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:29,854
But one day Rick whips it out and
starts rubbin' it on her leg and shit,

994
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:32,064
chasin' her around the living room;
I was dyin'.

995
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,859
You know what the crazy bitch did?
She fuckin' drops to her knees...

996
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,778
and starts suckin' him off right in
front of me, like I wasn't even there.

997
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:40,156
I almost died.
But that's not the fucked-up part.

998
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,160
The fucked-up part was Rick, right
in the middle of it, pointin' at her,

999
01:07:44,243 --> 01:07:46,579
and he says "Cohee,"
just like that, "Cohee."

1000
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,581
So I'm like, "Yo,
I'll give it a shot."

1001
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,459
I start pullin' her pants down and shit,
all slow 'cause I figure any second...

1002
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,669
she's gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, right?

1003
01:07:53,753 --> 01:07:57,214
But she's all into it, man!
She don't try to stop me or nothin'!

1004
01:07:57,298 --> 01:08:00,134
She's all wet and I just start goin'
to work, you know what I'm sayin'?

1005
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:03,053
Me and Rick are goin' to town on
this crazy bitch, and she's lovin' it,

1006
01:08:03,095 --> 01:08:05,055
all moaning and shit.

1007
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:06,974
It was fucked-up. So Rick
came up with the nickname.

1008
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:11,645
That day she had us locked in from
both sides like Chinese finger cuffs.

1009
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:12,980
He's full of shit.

1010
01:08:13,063 --> 01:08:15,983
Cohee's a lot of things, but an exaggerator he's not.

1011
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:18,110
- The dude's Catholic.
- She's never even been with a guy.

1012
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,405
That's what she says.
But I say her on her hands and knees...

1013
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:24,742
getting filled out like an application
constitutes "being with a guy."

1014
01:08:24,784 --> 01:08:27,787
Look, man. Cohee Lundin is
pulling your chain, okay?

1015
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,956
The fact you even believe him makes you
look like a complete fuckin' idiot.

1016
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,292
I'm getting your back, asshole!

1017
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,961
People don't forget shit
like "Finger Cuffs."

1018
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,590
What if it got out that she's queer as
well? How's that gonna make you look?

1019
01:08:39,673 --> 01:08:43,010
- Well, I give a shit what people think.
- Fuck!

1020
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:46,222
All right.
What if she's carrying a disease?

1021
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:48,265
- Fuck you!
- What?

1022
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:51,477
Oh, it's not possible
that she's all crudded-up?

1023
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,064
Cohee I can vouch for is clean.
The dude never got laid in high school.

1024
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:57,983
But Derris?
He's an arch-fucking-bushman!

1025
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:01,779
Name me one chick in our senior class
that he didn't nail, for Christ's sake!

1026
01:09:01,862 --> 01:09:05,116
Let it go, okay? I'm telling you,
she's never even been with a guy,

1027
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:07,201
much less these two fuckin' zeroes.

1028
01:09:07,284 --> 01:09:10,913
And the bitch could be a bigger germ
farm than that monkey in Outbreak!

1029
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:14,917
Would you let it go, okay?
I'm fuckin' tired of this shit!

1030
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,964
She's my goddamn girlfriend!
Show a little fuckin' respect!

1031
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:23,259
And I swear to God, if I ever hear you
so much as fucking mention...

1032
01:09:23,342 --> 01:09:28,347
Alyssa looks a little peaked, I'll put
your fucking teeth down your throat!

1033
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,186
Maybe I'll put your fuckin' teeth down your throat.

1034
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:36,814
Yeah, maybe.

1035
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:44,405
I've been workin' out, ya know!

1036
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:48,617
You better be ready to make that deal.

1037
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,789
So, where's that bitch partner of yours been?

1038
01:09:53,873 --> 01:09:55,082
Sulking.

1039
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,168
He's having a real problem with this Alyssa thing.

1040
01:09:57,251 --> 01:10:01,505
I think it's more like Banky's having a
real problem with all things not hetero,

1041
01:10:01,589 --> 01:10:04,467
and I'm just another paradigm of said aberration.

1042
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:09,764
- Banky does not hate gays.
- But he is a bit homophobic.

1043
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:13,392
This latest episode between you
and Miss Thing has tapped into that.

1044
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:17,980
In his warped perception, he lost you
to the "dark side," which is she.

1045
01:10:18,063 --> 01:10:19,982
You make it sound like me and him were dating.

1046
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:21,400
Don't kid yourself.

1047
01:10:21,442 --> 01:10:24,403
That boy loves you in a way
that he ain't ready to deal with.

1048
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:33,662
- He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.
- Uh-uh, honey!

1049
01:10:33,746 --> 01:10:39,627
And just what has Mr. Angela Lansbury
uncovered about your lady fair?

1050
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,421
He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys.

1051
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,548
Really?

1052
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:48,594
Then he's barkin' up the wrong tree
if he wants to split you up, isn't he?

1053
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,097
He's not gonna make you see the error of your ways...

1054
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,265
by pointing out how truly gay she's not.

1055
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,185
- This one?
- I have it.

1056
01:10:56,268 --> 01:11:01,315
- Actually, it has kinda gotten to me.
- How so?

1057
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:03,901
Well, Banky's got a pretty good bullshit detector.

1058
01:11:03,943 --> 01:11:06,278
- He's not known for misinformation.
- So what if it is true?

1059
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,906
- Would that bother you?
- Sex with multiple partners?

1060
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:10,950
At the same time?

1061
01:11:10,991 --> 01:11:12,952
Ah! Ooh!

1062
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:15,621
Thanks for being so comforting.
I appreciate it.

1063
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,623
So, what do you care?

1064
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,917
That's just it, you know?
I shouldn't care.

1065
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:21,919
- But it just-- It gets to me.
- Look,

1066
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:24,797
the kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't
think she's been in the middle...

1067
01:11:24,839 --> 01:11:27,258
of an all-girl group grope?

1068
01:11:29,969 --> 01:11:33,472
You see, that doesn't bother me, right?
But just the thought of her with guys--

1069
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:37,184
Oh, Holden, I beg you, please. Don't
drop 50 stories in my opinion of you...

1070
01:11:37,268 --> 01:11:40,312
by falling prey to that latest of trendy beasts.

1071
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,440
- Which is?
- Lesbian chic.

1072
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:46,861
It's oh-so acceptable to be a gay girl
nowadays. People think it's cute.

1073
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:50,322
Got this fool picture of lipstick lesbians in their heads,

1074
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:54,452
like they all resemble Alyssa,
while most of 'em look more like you.

1075
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:57,455
Do I detect a little intersubculture cattiness here?

1076
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,832
Gay or straight, ugly's still ugly.

1077
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,543
And most of those boys are scary.

1078
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:04,593
I thought you fags were all
super-supportive of one another.

1079
01:12:04,628 --> 01:12:06,505
Screw that all-for-one shit.

1080
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:09,175
I gotta deal with bein' a minority
in the minority of the minority,

1081
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,427
and nobody's supportin' my ass.

1082
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:14,847
While the whole of society's
fawning over girls-on-girls,

1083
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:16,849
here I sit, a reviled gay man.

1084
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:19,351
And to top that off, I'm a gay black man,

1085
01:12:19,393 --> 01:12:21,353
notoriously, the most swishy of the bunch.

1086
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:23,397
- Three strikes--
- Hey, hey! There's a line.

1087
01:12:23,481 --> 01:12:26,400
Are you Hooper X?

1088
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:33,783
- Salaam alaykem, little brother.
- Could you sign my comic?

1089
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:40,414
Hey. You see
that man right there?

1090
01:12:41,749 --> 01:12:45,503
He the devil.
Understand?

1091
01:12:45,544 --> 01:12:48,506
Never take your eye off the Man.

1092
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:58,224
- Fight the power, little G.
- Word is bond.

1093
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,559
Word is bond.

1094
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:07,316
Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect.

1095
01:13:07,317 --> 01:13:08,150
Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect.

1096
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:11,529
What is it about gay men
that terrifies the rest of the world?

1097
01:13:13,614 --> 01:13:17,368
- As for this hang-up with Alyssa's past,...
- Um-hm.

1098
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:21,372
...maybe what's troubling you is that
your fragile fantasy might not be true.

1099
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:24,708
- What does that mean?
- Holden, don't even try to come off...

1100
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:26,877
like you don't know what I'm sayin'.

1101
01:13:26,961 --> 01:13:31,674
Men need to believe that they're
Marco-fuckin'-Polo when it comes to sex.

1102
01:13:31,715 --> 01:13:34,385
Like they're the only ones
who've ever explored new territory.

1103
01:13:34,468 --> 01:13:37,054
And it's hard not to let 'em believe it.

1104
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:39,515
I let my boys run with it for a while.

1105
01:13:39,557 --> 01:13:42,268
Feed 'em some of that "I've never
done this before" bullshit...

1106
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,770
and let them labor under the delusion
that they're rockin' my world...

1107
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:47,731
until I can't stand 'em no more,
then I hit 'em with the truth.

1108
01:13:47,773 --> 01:13:49,733
It's a sick game.

1109
01:13:49,775 --> 01:13:51,735
The world would be a better place...

1110
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:53,821
if people would just accept
there's nothin' new under the sun,

1111
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:55,823
and anything you can do with a person...

1112
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:58,784
has probably been done long before you got there.

1113
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:02,288
- Hey, I can accept that.
- Honey, that almost sounded convincing.

1114
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,084
Just ask the girl
about her past point-blank.

1115
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:10,087
Get it out of the way before it gets
too big for both of y'all to move.

1116
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:12,089
Ooh! Yanni!

1117
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:28,522
Boo! Boo!

1118
01:14:31,525 --> 01:14:33,986
Since most of these people are rooting for the home team,

1119
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,988
I'm going to cheer for the visitors.

1120
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,324
I'm a big visitors fan.

1121
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,952
Especially the kind that make coffee
for you in the morning before they go.

1122
01:14:43,996 --> 01:14:47,124
That was a joke.
Bah-dum-bah.

1123
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:50,252
A little wacky wordplay.

1124
01:14:50,336 --> 01:14:53,089
Wha-What do you mean,
"visitors"?

1125
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:55,132
Was I being too obscure?

1126
01:14:55,216 --> 01:15:00,387
The kind that, until recently,
had no dicks and would stay the night.

1127
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,601
So, uh, that was until recently, right?

1128
01:15:05,684 --> 01:15:07,770
Uh, yeah.

1129
01:15:13,692 --> 01:15:17,780
Hey! Foul! Foul!
He was traveling or something.

1130
01:15:17,863 --> 01:15:22,159
So, nobody but me has spent the night
at your place since we got together?

1131
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:24,161
Somethin' on your mind, Holden?

1132
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:28,624
- Just wondering.
- If I've been faithful or something?

1133
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:32,128
I was just asking.

1134
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:35,506
Oh, sweetie.

1135
01:15:35,548 --> 01:15:38,968
I only have eyes for you.

1136
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:48,310
If you don't start usin' that whistle,
I'm gonna jam it straight up your ass!

1137
01:15:48,394 --> 01:15:50,312
Right?

1138
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,817
What's uh--
What's with "Finger Cuffs"?

1139
01:16:08,414 --> 01:16:10,374
"Finger Cuffs"?

1140
01:16:10,416 --> 01:16:15,296
In your senior yearbook your nickname
was Finger Cuffs. What does that mean?

1141
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:18,048
- It was?
- Yeah.

1142
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:21,844
Shit.
Damned if I can remember.

1143
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:25,097
I'd look it up, but I threw all that shit out years ago.

1144
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:28,058
- Where'd you see a North yearbook?
- Do you know a Rick Derris?

1145
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:33,105
- Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

1146
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:38,402
Sure. We used to
hang out in high school.

1147
01:16:38,486 --> 01:16:40,863
Punch him in the fuckin' neck, number 12!

1148
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:44,158
Come on. Come on!

1149
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:46,660
Did you guys, like, date or something?

1150
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:50,998
Date Rick Derris?
No, no. We just hung out a lot.

1151
01:16:51,082 --> 01:16:53,501
Just-Just you and Rick.

1152
01:16:53,584 --> 01:16:57,588
No. Me, Rick and, um--

1153
01:16:57,671 --> 01:16:59,882
God, what was his name?

1154
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:02,259
Um-- What was his name?

1155
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:04,804
- What was his name?
- Cohee.

1156
01:17:04,845 --> 01:17:07,098
Yes! Cohee! Cohee Lundin!

1157
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:09,433
God, I haven't thought about that name in years.

1158
01:17:12,645 --> 01:17:16,148
Those guys used to come over to my house
almost every day after school.

1159
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:20,361
They'd bug my sisters, look through
my dad's closet for porno tapes,

1160
01:17:20,444 --> 01:17:22,530
raid the fridge.

1161
01:17:22,613 --> 01:17:25,699
They really took advantage
of my parents' never being home.

1162
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,122
This one day,

1163
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:35,126
Rick pulled his dick out and started
chasing me around the house with it.

1164
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:37,378
Right in front of Cohee, man.
I couldn't believe it.

1165
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,801
Rick pulled his dick out?
Really?

1166
01:17:43,843 --> 01:17:46,429
What did you do?

1167
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:49,140
I blew him while Cohee fucked me!

1168
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:57,314
- Excuse me?
- That's what you wanted to hear.

1169
01:17:57,398 --> 01:18:02,445
That's what this little
cross-examination of your is all about?

1170
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,989
Well, next time try not to make it so obvious, all right?

1171
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:09,452
There's subtler ways
of badgering a witness. Am I right?

1172
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:12,788
Geez, man. Even I knew
what you were gettin' at.

1173
01:18:12,872 --> 01:18:16,292
If you wanted background information
on me, all you had to do was ask.

1174
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,335
I would have gladly volunteered it.

1175
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:20,921
You didn't have to go playing
Hercule-fucking-Poirot.

1176
01:18:27,052 --> 01:18:29,013
Told ya these were good seats.

1177
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:41,692
Hey. Hey!

1178
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:46,030
- Hey, would you wait a minute?
- Get the fuck off me!

1179
01:18:46,072 --> 01:18:50,201
- So it's true, right?
- Is that what you wanna hear?

1180
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:52,203
Yeah, Holden, it's true.

1181
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:56,207
In fact, everything you heard
or dug up on me is probably true.

1182
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:58,709
Yeah, I took on two guys at once!

1183
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:02,213
You wanna hear some gems you might not have unearthed?

1184
01:19:02,296 --> 01:19:05,382
I took a 26-year-old guy
to my senior prom...

1185
01:19:05,424 --> 01:19:09,845
and left to have sex with him
and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo.

1186
01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:14,975
How about in college when I let Shannon
Hamilton videotape us having sex,

1187
01:19:15,059 --> 01:19:19,688
only to find out he broadcast it
on the campus cable station.

1188
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:24,735
They're all true. Didn't you know?
I am the queen of suburban legend!

1189
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:27,029
Did you somehow fuckin' fail to mention this to me?

1190
01:19:27,113 --> 01:19:29,365
What the fuck's wrong with you?
How could you do all those things?

1191
01:19:29,448 --> 01:19:30,950
Easily!

1192
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:35,913
Some I did out of stupidity, some
I did out of what I thought was love.

1193
01:19:35,955 --> 01:19:38,999
But good or bad, they are my choices,

1194
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:42,128
and I am not making apologies for them now!

1195
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:45,589
Not to you, or not to anyone!

1196
01:19:45,631 --> 01:19:50,511
And how dare you lay a guilt trip on me
about it, in public, no less?

1197
01:19:50,594 --> 01:19:54,140
Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgmental prick?

1198
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,475
How the fuck am I supposed to feel about all this?

1199
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:58,727
How are you supposed to feel about it?

1200
01:19:58,811 --> 01:20:02,648
Feel whatever the fuck you want to about it, all right?

1201
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,027
The only thing that matters is how you feel about me.

1202
01:20:08,946 --> 01:20:11,157
- I don't know how I feel about you now.
- Why? Why?

1203
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,951
- Because I had some sex?
- Some sex?

1204
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:18,539
Yes, Holden.
That's all it was, some sex.

1205
01:20:18,622 --> 01:20:20,958
Most of it stupid high school sex.

1206
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,502
Like you never had sex in high school.

1207
01:20:23,544 --> 01:20:27,840
There is a world of fucking difference
between typical high school sex...

1208
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,802
and getting fucked by two fuckin' guys at the same time!

1209
01:20:31,844 --> 01:20:36,182
- They fuckin' used you.
- No! I used them!

1210
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:40,561
You don't think I would have let it
happen if I hadn't wanted to, do you?

1211
01:20:40,644 --> 01:20:44,732
I was an experimental girl, for Christ's sake!

1212
01:20:44,815 --> 01:20:49,111
Maybe you knew early on
that your track was from point A to B,

1213
01:20:49,195 --> 01:20:53,032
but, unlike you, I was not given a fucking map at birth.

1214
01:20:53,074 --> 01:20:55,284
So I tried it all.

1215
01:20:55,367 --> 01:21:00,539
That is until we--
that's you and I-- got together.

1216
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:03,626
And suddenly I was sated.

1217
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:07,254
Can't you take some fucking comfort in that?

1218
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:11,342
You turned out to be all I was looking for,

1219
01:21:11,425 --> 01:21:15,763
the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle.

1220
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:24,980
Look, I'm sorry I let you believe you
were the only guy I'd ever been with.

1221
01:21:25,064 --> 01:21:28,109
I should have been more honest.

1222
01:21:28,192 --> 01:21:32,405
But it just didn't-- It seemed
to make you feel special in a way...

1223
01:21:32,446 --> 01:21:38,369
that me telling you over and over how
incredible you are wouldn't get across.

1224
01:21:39,453 --> 01:21:42,456
Holden, I'm sorry.

1225
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,542
Just don't do that.

1226
01:21:47,795 --> 01:21:52,842
Do you mean to tell me that,
while you have zero problem...

1227
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:55,886
with me sleeping with half the women in New York City,

1228
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:59,390
you have some sort of half-assed,
mealy-mouthed objection...

1229
01:21:59,473 --> 01:22:03,185
to pubescent antics that took place almost ten years ago?

1230
01:22:03,269 --> 01:22:06,522
What the fuck is your problem?

1231
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,609
I want us to be something that we can't be.

1232
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:12,611
And what's that?

1233
01:22:12,653 --> 01:22:15,114
A normal couple.

1234
01:22:16,991 --> 01:22:20,911
So why don't you give your little voice a rest

1235
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:24,123
- Fuck!
- Come on up inside my bed

1236
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:27,877
And just pretend you need me

1237
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:34,175
You don't have to lie about what you know

1238
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:39,889
Even though I've been sufferin'

1239
01:22:41,599 --> 01:22:45,561
And I don't need to be your only one

1240
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:48,647
I don't need your comforting

1241
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:52,902
I just need you with me

1242
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:58,866
Stay, stay, stay with me

1243
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:03,412
Stay, stay with me

1244
01:23:04,997 --> 01:23:06,916
Stay and don't you ever roll away from me

1245
01:23:06,957 --> 01:23:08,417
The girl?

1246
01:23:10,836 --> 01:23:12,755
Stay

1247
01:23:12,838 --> 01:23:17,134
Stay with me

1248
01:23:17,218 --> 01:23:19,178
Oh, and did she ever

1249
01:23:25,976 --> 01:23:29,438
Well, look at this morose motherfucker right here.

1250
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:36,070
Smells like someone shit
in his cereal. Nooch.

1251
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,531
What took you guys so long?
What are you, at the mall again?

1252
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:43,077
Bitch, don't even start, all right?
We stopped that shit years ago.

1253
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:45,079
Toss the salad.

1254
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:54,088
Damn, this likeness rights shit
is more profitable than sellin' smoke.

1255
01:23:55,673 --> 01:23:58,134
How did a dirt merchant like you
ever learn about likeness rights?

1256
01:23:58,217 --> 01:24:01,720
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1257
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:05,433
Speaking of which--
A little signin' bonus and shit?

1258
01:24:05,516 --> 01:24:11,313
No, I'll pass.
Did you guys take a look at the issue?

1259
01:24:11,397 --> 01:24:13,941
Yeah.

1260
01:24:14,024 --> 01:24:18,279
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,448
You need to throw some pussy in that book, man.

1262
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:23,367
Like, throw some supervillain with big fuckin' tits...

1263
01:24:23,451 --> 01:24:26,328
that shoot milk or somethin',
and I'll just, like, suck her dry...

1264
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,998
and bust some moves on her.

1265
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,338
Then she has to fuck me.
I mean, fuck us.

1266
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,966
I'll see what I can do.

1267
01:24:40,926 --> 01:24:44,847
- All right, boys. What'll it be?
- I'm all set, thanks.

1268
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:49,101
Yo, Flo. Tell Mel to whip me up
a toasted bagel with cream cheese.

1269
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:54,231
You want one too? Make that two,
and kiss my grits. Nooch.

1270
01:24:55,983 --> 01:24:59,653
Did you ever watch that show, Alice?
That show was funny as hell, man.

1271
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:04,200
So why the long face, horse?
Banky on the rag?

1272
01:25:04,283 --> 01:25:07,536
I'm just, uh-- I'm just havin'
a little girl trouble.

1273
01:25:07,578 --> 01:25:10,164
Bitch pressin' charges?
I get that a lot.

1274
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:13,834
No. I'm just, uh--

1275
01:25:15,294 --> 01:25:17,505
I'm just at a point where I don't really know what to do.

1276
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:21,300
Kick her to the fuckin' curb.
Girls get to be too much trouble.

1277
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:24,512
There's always the band... of the hand.

1278
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,891
Can't do it, G.
I'm in love.

1279
01:25:28,974 --> 01:25:33,020
Nah, there ain't no such thing. You
got to boil it down to the essentials.

1280
01:25:33,104 --> 01:25:37,900
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

1281
01:25:39,568 --> 01:25:43,030
Thanks, guys. That's just what I needed.
Advice from the 'hood.

1282
01:25:43,072 --> 01:25:47,743
- So who is this girl?
- Oh, I don't think you know her.

1283
01:25:48,994 --> 01:25:51,831
Come on, man.
I'm people who know people.

1284
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,833
You sound like Barbra Streisand.

1285
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,669
Maybe 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playin' her greatest hits tape...

1286
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:58,671
in my ear all the time.

1287
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:02,967
You gotta see it. When she starts
singin' "You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"

1288
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:06,178
this faggot starts cryin' like a little
girl with a skinned knee and shit.

1289
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:10,099
Big fuckin' softie.
So what's the skirt's name?

1290
01:26:10,182 --> 01:26:12,601
I'm tellin' ya, man.
You don't know the girl.

1291
01:26:12,643 --> 01:26:16,939
I ain't playin', man.
Come on, tell me her name, Mysterio.

1292
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:20,609
Alyssa Jones.

1293
01:26:22,862 --> 01:26:25,781
Holy fuckin' shit.
Finger Cuffs?

1294
01:26:25,823 --> 01:26:30,494
You're dating Finger Cuffs, you silly son of a bitch?

1295
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:32,788
Wait a second.
I thought she was all gay and shit.

1296
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:35,750
She was, or she is.
I don't know.

1297
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:38,919
And you're dating her.
Man, you're a lucky fuck.

1298
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:40,921
She ever bring bitches to bed with you?

1299
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:43,174
Get a little of that
Filet-O-Fish sandwich goin' on?

1300
01:26:43,257 --> 01:26:45,760
Yeah, you know what
I'm talkin' about, baby. Right?

1301
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:49,722
What's up? Yeah.
So four tits and what?

1302
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:53,476
- No, man. It's not like that.
- What's it like, then?

1303
01:26:53,559 --> 01:26:57,438
Right now?
I don't know.

1304
01:26:57,521 --> 01:27:00,483
I love her, you know?
But, uh, she has a past.

1305
01:27:00,566 --> 01:27:04,487
I'll say. Stuffin' two guys,
eatin' chicks out and shit.

1306
01:27:04,528 --> 01:27:06,822
You know, I heard
one time she had this dog--

1307
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:10,117
Eat your fuckin' bagel already and shut up.

1308
01:27:10,201 --> 01:27:14,121
Look at this touchy motherfucker right here.

1309
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:16,665
So if you're all in love and shit, what's the problem?

1310
01:27:16,707 --> 01:27:20,377
The problem is stupid shit like that.

1311
01:27:20,461 --> 01:27:22,296
It was bad enough when it was just girls, you know?

1312
01:27:22,379 --> 01:27:26,300
You throw guys into the mix--
two guys at once, no less--

1313
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:29,470
All that experience, you know?
What am I supposed to think?

1314
01:27:29,553 --> 01:27:34,475
Think "good," ya fuckin' ninny shithead,
'cause now she'll be all true and blue.

1315
01:27:34,558 --> 01:27:39,355
Bitch tasted life. Now she's settlin'
for your borin' funny-book-makin' ass.

1316
01:27:39,438 --> 01:27:42,650
Settling for my boring ass.
That's comforting. Thanks, Jay.

1317
01:27:42,733 --> 01:27:47,696
- That's what I'm here for.
- I'm just havin' a problem with it.

1318
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:51,992
It's like I can't get these visuals out
of my head of her doing all this shit.

1319
01:27:52,076 --> 01:27:56,455
And I don't know why I can't let
it go, 'cause I'm crazy about this girl.

1320
01:27:56,539 --> 01:28:00,543
- I look at her, I see kids, grandkids--
- You're scarin' me.

1321
01:28:00,626 --> 01:28:03,254
Yeah, well, I'm scarin' myself
'cause I think so much of this girl...

1322
01:28:03,337 --> 01:28:06,382
that I can't get stupid shit
like "Finger Cuffs" out of my head.

1323
01:28:08,008 --> 01:28:11,720
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

1324
01:28:15,266 --> 01:28:17,226
Chasin' Amy.

1325
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:22,231
What?
What did you say?

1326
01:28:24,442 --> 01:28:27,570
- You're chasing Amy.
- What do you look so shocked for, man?

1327
01:28:27,653 --> 01:28:31,615
Fat bastard does this all the time. He
thinks 'cause he don't say anything...

1328
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:34,368
it'll have some huge impact
when he does open his fuckin' mouth.

1329
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:36,370
Jesus Christ, why don't you shut up?

1330
01:28:36,454 --> 01:28:40,875
Always yap-yap-yapping all the time.
Give me a fuckin' headache.

1331
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:43,753
I went through somethin' like what
you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

1332
01:28:43,836 --> 01:28:46,130
- This chick named Amy.
- When?

1333
01:28:47,548 --> 01:28:49,759
A couple of years ago.

1334
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:52,052
What, she live in Canada or something?
Why don't I remember this?

1335
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:54,096
Bitch, what you don't know about me...

1336
01:28:54,138 --> 01:28:56,098
I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

1337
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:00,561
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas? Huh?

1338
01:29:00,644 --> 01:29:04,356
Bet you didn't even know that shit, did you?

1339
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,276
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

1340
01:29:09,028 --> 01:29:13,908
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

1341
01:29:13,991 --> 01:29:16,911
Then four months down the road the idiot gear kicks in,

1342
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:20,456
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

1343
01:29:20,498 --> 01:29:23,918
You don't want to know, but you just have to know.

1344
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:25,920
Stupid guy bullshit.

1345
01:29:26,003 --> 01:29:28,464
So, anyway, she starts tellin' me about him.

1346
01:29:28,547 --> 01:29:32,843
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

1347
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:36,847
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

1348
01:29:36,889 --> 01:29:39,934
But then she drops the bomb on me, and the bomb is this:

1349
01:29:40,017 --> 01:29:43,312
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

1350
01:29:43,354 --> 01:29:45,648
he brought some people to bed with them.

1351
01:29:45,731 --> 01:29:48,109
Menage-a-trois,
I believe it's called.

1352
01:29:48,192 --> 01:29:51,654
Now this just blows my mind, right?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1353
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:56,117
- I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
- Saint Shithead.

1354
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,119
Do somethin'.

1355
01:29:58,202 --> 01:30:01,455
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right? And I just start blastin' her.

1356
01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:04,291
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I figure the best way is...

1357
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:07,336
if call her "slut," right, and tell her she was used.

1358
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:10,506
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

1359
01:30:10,548 --> 01:30:14,427
"What the fuck is your problem?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

1360
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:18,431
"It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

1361
01:30:18,514 --> 01:30:20,599
because she doesn't feel that she's done anything wrong.

1362
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:25,479
I'm like, "Oh, really?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

1363
01:30:27,273 --> 01:30:29,358
Fuckin' A.

1364
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:32,153
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

1365
01:30:32,236 --> 01:30:34,321
I wasn't disgusted with her, I was afraid.

1366
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:38,159
You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,

1367
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,747
like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

1368
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:46,250
But what I did not get, she didn't care.

1369
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:50,880
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

1370
01:30:50,963 --> 01:30:56,177
But by the time I figured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

1371
01:30:56,218 --> 01:31:00,055
All I had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.

1372
01:31:01,682 --> 01:31:06,020
She was the girl.
I know that now.

1373
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,856
But...

1374
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:12,985
I pushed her away.

1375
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:23,287
So I've spent every day since then chasing Amy.

1376
01:31:25,372 --> 01:31:27,333
So to speak.

1377
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:32,171
Enough of this fuckin' melodrama.
My advice? Forget her, dude.

1378
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:36,634
There's one bitch in the world, one bitch with many faces.

1379
01:31:36,717 --> 01:31:41,222
Get up, tons of fun.
We gotta book.

1380
01:31:41,305 --> 01:31:45,059
- Catchin' a bus to Chi-town.
- Why? What's there?

1381
01:31:45,101 --> 01:31:48,854
Business, yo. How many more of those
fat envelopes we get comin' to us?

1382
01:31:48,938 --> 01:31:51,774
Uh, I don't know.

1383
01:31:51,816 --> 01:31:54,276
I don't know how much longer the book's gonna be around.

1384
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,446
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

1385
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:01,700
There's a million people who'd love
to see themself in a comic book.

1386
01:32:01,784 --> 01:32:04,495
But that ain't like us at all, all slapsticky and shit,

1387
01:32:04,578 --> 01:32:06,247
runnin' around like a couple of dickheads.

1388
01:32:06,288 --> 01:32:09,208
Sayin'-- What's that shit
he got us sayin'?

1389
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:12,628
Oh, um...
"snootchie-bootchies."

1390
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:18,092
"Snootchie-bootchies." Who the fuck
talks like that? That is baby talk.

1391
01:32:19,802 --> 01:32:23,013
It's a big world, G.
We're bound to run into you again.

1392
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:26,976
- Till then, keep your unit on ya.
- I'll try.

1393
01:32:27,017 --> 01:32:30,479
No, no, no, no, no.
Do or do not. There is no try--

1394
01:32:30,563 --> 01:32:34,859
Knock that shit off!
We got a bus to catch.

1395
01:32:34,942 --> 01:32:38,904
Jedi bitch. Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

1396
01:32:38,988 --> 01:32:40,865
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.

1397
01:33:30,164 --> 01:33:32,124
Okay.

1398
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:36,754
You guys are probably wondering
why I asked you here at the same time...

1399
01:33:36,837 --> 01:33:40,549
knowing that we have shit to settle between us separately.

1400
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:43,886
I just figured you wanted
to kill two birds with one stone.

1401
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:46,806
You know, by telling her to fuck off with me here...

1402
01:33:46,889 --> 01:33:49,350
so you wouldn't have to
go through the story again later on.

1403
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:52,812
- Fuck you.
- Not even if you let me videotape it.

1404
01:33:52,895 --> 01:33:55,856
Okay, enough.
All right?

1405
01:33:57,274 --> 01:34:00,319
Enough.

1406
01:34:00,403 --> 01:34:04,365
Now, I've been going over and
over and over this whole thing,

1407
01:34:04,407 --> 01:34:07,076
and I've dissected it a thousand different ways.

1408
01:34:07,118 --> 01:34:10,830
Banky, there's tension between you and I
for the first time in our lives.

1409
01:34:10,913 --> 01:34:15,668
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want
me to sign off on this cartoon thing.

1410
01:34:15,751 --> 01:34:17,920
How perceptive.

1411
01:34:17,962 --> 01:34:18,462
Alyssa,

1412
01:34:22,299 --> 01:34:24,343
you and I have hit a wall...

1413
01:34:24,427 --> 01:34:28,889
'cause I don't know how to deal
with your, uh, your past, I guess.

1414
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,891
That's a nice way of putting it.

1415
01:34:30,933 --> 01:34:32,935
I'd have said "the whole double stuff" thing.

1416
01:34:39,525 --> 01:34:43,112
I'm only gonna
tell you this once: Shut up.

1417
01:34:45,531 --> 01:34:47,450
Now,

1418
01:34:47,533 --> 01:34:51,579
I know I'm to blame one way or another on both accounts.

1419
01:34:51,662 --> 01:34:55,624
Alyssa, with you
because... I feel inadequate,

1420
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:58,961
because you've had such a big life and so much experience,

1421
01:34:59,003 --> 01:35:01,756
and my life's been pretty small in comparison.

1422
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:05,009
- That doesn't matter to me.
- Please.

1423
01:35:05,092 --> 01:35:08,387
I have to get through this, okay?

1424
01:35:08,471 --> 01:35:13,225
Banky, I know why you're having such
a hard time with me and Alyssa.

1425
01:35:13,309 --> 01:35:16,228
It's something that's been
obvious forever and I guess--

1426
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:19,482
I guess I just didn't acknowledge it.

1427
01:35:21,025 --> 01:35:22,985
You're in love with me.

1428
01:35:25,237 --> 01:35:27,156
What?

1429
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:32,036
You're attracted to me. Just as, in
a way, I guess I'm... attracted to you.

1430
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:34,830
It makes sense. We've been together
so long, we have so much in common.

1431
01:35:34,872 --> 01:35:37,833
Well, I gotta get goin'.

1432
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:40,461
I gotta catch the last few minutes of Little House.

1433
01:35:49,053 --> 01:35:51,680
It's somethin' you're gonna have to deal with, Bank.

1434
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:55,392
And that would explain your jealousy of Alyssa,

1435
01:35:55,476 --> 01:35:58,145
your homophobia,
your sense of humor--

1436
01:35:58,229 --> 01:36:00,981
Jesus, just 'cause a guy's
got a predilection toward dick jokes--

1437
01:36:01,065 --> 01:36:03,734
Bank. Stop.

1438
01:36:03,818 --> 01:36:06,862
Deal with it.
You'll feel much better.

1439
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,450
Okay.

1440
01:36:16,497 --> 01:36:20,418
Now, you guys are probably
asking yourselves the same question...

1441
01:36:20,459 --> 01:36:24,422
that I've been going over and over
in my head the past few weeks:

1442
01:36:24,505 --> 01:36:26,424
What does one have to do with the other?

1443
01:36:26,507 --> 01:36:27,716
Don't.

1444
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,387
And when I did some
serious soul-searching,

1445
01:36:31,429 --> 01:36:33,722
it came to me from outta nowhere.

1446
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:38,894
And it all made sense.
And a calm came over me.

1447
01:36:38,936 --> 01:36:42,022
I know what we have to do.

1448
01:36:42,106 --> 01:36:46,360
And then you, Banky,
you, Alyssa, and I--

1449
01:36:46,444 --> 01:36:51,365
all of us--
can finally be... all right.

1450
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:53,659
Please don't say it.

1451
01:36:56,287 --> 01:36:59,206
We've all gotta have sex together.

1452
01:37:08,507 --> 01:37:10,468
I mean, look, don't you see?

1453
01:37:10,509 --> 01:37:14,263
That would take care of everything.

1454
01:37:14,305 --> 01:37:17,349
Alyssa, with you, I won't feel
too inadequate or conservative anymore,

1455
01:37:17,433 --> 01:37:20,603
because I'll have done something
on a par with all your experience.

1456
01:37:20,686 --> 01:37:25,399
And it will be with you, which will
make it that much more powerful.

1457
01:37:25,483 --> 01:37:27,401
Banky, you can take that leap...

1458
01:37:27,485 --> 01:37:29,820
that everyone else but you sees you should take.

1459
01:37:29,862 --> 01:37:33,240
And it'll be with me, your best friend for years.

1460
01:37:33,324 --> 01:37:35,284
We've been everything to each other but intimates,

1461
01:37:35,326 --> 01:37:37,953
and now we'll have been through that together too.

1462
01:37:37,995 --> 01:37:40,790
And it won't be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved.

1463
01:37:40,831 --> 01:37:44,960
And when it's over, all that hostility
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone...

1464
01:37:45,002 --> 01:37:47,838
because you'll have shared in something
beautiful with the woman I love.

1465
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,633
It'll be cathartic.

1466
01:37:50,674 --> 01:37:53,594
This will keep us together.

1467
01:38:03,229 --> 01:38:05,689
What do ya say?

1468
01:38:20,162 --> 01:38:22,081
Sure.

1469
01:38:37,972 --> 01:38:40,975
You know I need this.

1470
01:38:41,016 --> 01:38:43,602
You know it'll help.

1471
01:38:43,686 --> 01:38:46,021
No.

1472
01:38:46,105 --> 01:38:48,274
Thank Christ.

1473
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:53,154
Sorry.

1474
01:38:59,076 --> 01:39:03,038
No? I thought
you'd be into this.

1475
01:39:03,122 --> 01:39:07,501
You did?
What does that say about me?

1476
01:39:07,585 --> 01:39:10,671
Sweetheart, you've done stuff like this before.

1477
01:39:10,755 --> 01:39:12,673
This should be no big deal for you.

1478
01:39:12,757 --> 01:39:17,136
You don't want this.
You really don't want this.

1479
01:39:17,178 --> 01:39:22,892
No, I do want this. This has
to happen. Can't you see that?

1480
01:39:22,975 --> 01:39:27,563
I mean, how can you not? No?
What does that say about me?

1481
01:39:27,646 --> 01:39:29,982
You can take it from two guys
whose names you can hardly remember,

1482
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:34,236
but I ask you to share an experience
about intimacy, and you say no?

1483
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:38,824
- I can't.
- Baby, yes, you can.

1484
01:39:38,866 --> 01:39:43,120
I'll be there. And when it's over we'll
be the strongest we've ever been...

1485
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:45,122
'cause we'll have been through this together.

1486
01:39:45,206 --> 01:39:49,168
Then we'll be on the same level and
there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.

1487
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:52,379
Oh, Holden.

1488
01:39:54,715 --> 01:39:56,884
That time is over for me.

1489
01:39:56,967 --> 01:39:58,886
I've been there and I've done it...

1490
01:39:58,969 --> 01:40:02,890
and I didn't find what I was looking for in any of it.

1491
01:40:02,932 --> 01:40:06,894
I found that it you.
In us.

1492
01:40:06,936 --> 01:40:10,606
Doing this won't help you forget
about the things you're hung up on.

1493
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:15,069
- It'll create more.
- No. I've thought about all that.

1494
01:40:15,152 --> 01:40:18,114
Yes, it will!

1495
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:25,162
Maybe you'll see me differently from then on.

1496
01:40:25,246 --> 01:40:30,418
Maybe you'll despise me for going along
with it once you're in the moment.

1497
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:32,420
Maybe I'll moan differently,

1498
01:40:32,503 --> 01:40:36,424
and then you'll resent Banky and become suspicious of us.

1499
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:39,468
Or you'll alienate him because of it.

1500
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:45,224
You'll grow to blame and hate me for
the deterioration of your friendship.

1501
01:40:45,266 --> 01:40:48,519
Or what if-- and God,
I sincerely doubt it--

1502
01:40:48,602 --> 01:40:52,732
but what if I saw something
in Banky that I've never seen before,

1503
01:40:52,815 --> 01:40:56,944
you know, and I fell in love with him and left you?

1504
01:40:58,028 --> 01:41:02,158
I've been down roads like this before.

1505
01:41:02,241 --> 01:41:04,160
Many times.

1506
01:41:07,204 --> 01:41:11,751
I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons...

1507
01:41:11,834 --> 01:41:15,129
and give you experience.

1508
01:41:15,212 --> 01:41:20,050
But I've had those experiences, on my own.

1509
01:41:20,134 --> 01:41:23,679
And I can't accompany you on yours.

1510
01:41:23,763 --> 01:41:26,307
I'm past that now.

1511
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:35,524
Or maybe I just love you too much.

1512
01:41:35,608 --> 01:41:41,072
And I feel hurt and let down that you
would want to share me with anyone.

1513
01:41:42,156 --> 01:41:45,534
Because I would never want to share you.

1514
01:41:57,671 --> 01:42:00,424
Regardless,

1515
01:42:00,508 --> 01:42:03,344
I can't be a part of this.

1516
01:42:03,385 --> 01:42:07,890
Or you.
Not anymore.

1517
01:42:10,059 --> 01:42:14,146
I love you.

1518
01:42:14,188 --> 01:42:16,690
I always will.

1519
01:42:16,732 --> 01:42:19,693
Know that.

1520
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:29,370
But I'm not your fucking whore.

1521
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:36,377
He's yours again.

1522
01:43:34,977 --> 01:43:36,937
A blast from the past.

1523
01:43:36,979 --> 01:43:39,774
Do you know how much it's
going for these days? $110.

1524
01:43:39,815 --> 01:43:41,817
You sign it, it'll push that up even higher.

1525
01:43:41,901 --> 01:43:44,612
You sell it I want a kickback.

1526
01:43:44,695 --> 01:43:46,155
I don't know if it's true,

1527
01:43:46,197 --> 01:43:48,324
but I heard once there was going to be an animated series?

1528
01:43:48,407 --> 01:43:50,659
- There was going to be.
- What happened?

1529
01:43:50,743 --> 01:43:53,746
You're lookin' at it.
No Chronic, no cartoon.

1530
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:57,166
- That would have been awesome!
- Tell me about it.

1531
01:43:57,249 --> 01:44:00,002
So is that what happened with you and Holden McNeil?

1532
01:44:00,086 --> 01:44:02,588
You got into a fight over the rights or something?

1533
01:44:02,671 --> 01:44:05,966
- It was more complicated than that.
- Whatever happened to that guy?

1534
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,844
I don't know.
Quit the biz, I guess.

1535
01:44:08,928 --> 01:44:10,930
So, you guys don't talk anymore?

1536
01:44:11,013 --> 01:44:14,934
No. Not really.

1537
01:44:15,017 --> 01:44:19,355
Yeah. That happened to me once.
Me and this guy started a comic club.

1538
01:44:19,438 --> 01:44:24,443
And we got into a fight over who looked
better in bare legs, Electra or Robin.

1539
01:44:24,527 --> 01:44:30,282
Anyway, I disbanded the club and struck
out on my own, kinda like Nomad.

1540
01:44:30,366 --> 01:44:33,994
I'm rambling on now.
What I meant to say is...

1541
01:44:34,078 --> 01:44:36,789
that you probably shouldn't have killed off Chronic.

1542
01:44:36,872 --> 01:44:41,252
Guess not. Some doors just
shouldn't be opened.

1543
01:44:41,335 --> 01:44:44,004
Oh, like the door to death in Baby Dave's Winter Special,

1544
01:44:44,088 --> 01:44:46,048
which you did on your own.

1545
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:50,344
See? You don't need that McNeil guy,
anyway. You do great work on your own.

1546
01:44:50,386 --> 01:44:54,515
Look at your line work. Look at all the
detail in this douche bag on page 18.

1547
01:44:54,557 --> 01:44:56,350
Look at how you draw a fart.

1548
01:44:56,392 --> 01:44:59,729
And tell me you're not better off without Holden McNeil.

1549
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:02,398
I mean, you were just carrying
that guy like a brown-bag lunch,

1550
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:04,400
you know what I'm saying?

1551
01:45:04,483 --> 01:45:08,237
- You're so right.
- Yeah, well, the true fans always are.

1552
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:13,325
Well, keep up the good work, man.
Love those dick jokes. Love 'em.

1553
01:45:15,661 --> 01:45:17,580
See ya.

1554
01:45:20,082 --> 01:45:22,042
Yeah.

1555
01:45:24,336 --> 01:45:26,255
Bye.

1556
01:45:38,017 --> 01:45:40,227
Okay. Who's next?

1557
01:45:41,979 --> 01:45:43,939
Hi.

1558
01:45:50,112 --> 01:45:53,032
Thanks for readin' it.

1559
01:45:53,115 --> 01:45:56,077
I can't believe this place.
These people are so weird.

1560
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,120
You wanted to come.

1561
01:45:58,162 --> 01:46:00,498
God, I can't believe you call these people contemporaries.

1562
01:46:00,581 --> 01:46:03,125
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears? What's that?

1563
01:46:03,209 --> 01:46:05,127
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what?

1564
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:07,588
A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.

1565
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:10,132
Why don't you take a walk and get us something to drink?

1566
01:46:10,216 --> 01:46:11,634
Okay, I will.

1567
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,530
Um, this isn't one of mine.

1568
01:46:32,613 --> 01:46:34,532
It's mine.

1569
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,369
I saved you a copy.

1570
01:46:41,664 --> 01:46:43,582
Hi.

1571
01:46:43,666 --> 01:46:45,584
Hi.

1572
01:46:45,668 --> 01:46:48,003
How've you been?

1573
01:46:48,045 --> 01:46:52,508
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself?

1574
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:54,510
Good.

1575
01:47:01,225 --> 01:47:04,812
The new issue's selling like crazy, for some reason.

1576
01:47:04,895 --> 01:47:08,607
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

1577
01:47:08,691 --> 01:47:10,609
Thank you.

1578
01:47:13,237 --> 01:47:15,906
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out?

1579
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:19,535
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

1580
01:47:19,577 --> 01:47:21,704
Self-financed,
only about 500 issues.

1581
01:47:21,746 --> 01:47:24,415
Will I enjoy it?

1582
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:28,127
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

1583
01:47:45,644 --> 01:47:49,440
Looks like a very personal story.

1584
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:56,697
I finally had something personal to say.

1585
01:48:01,702 --> 01:48:05,247
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

1586
01:48:05,289 --> 01:48:07,875
Yeah.

1587
01:48:07,958 --> 01:48:11,879
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

1588
01:48:20,304 --> 01:48:22,723
You know, read that, if you have a minute.

1589
01:48:22,807 --> 01:48:25,267
I will.

1590
01:48:28,979 --> 01:48:33,901
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

1591
01:48:33,984 --> 01:48:36,737
Okay.

1592
01:48:38,322 --> 01:48:40,241
Okay.

1593
01:48:42,576 --> 01:48:44,703
It was really nice seeing you again.

1594
01:48:44,787 --> 01:48:47,998
It was really nice to see you too.

1595
01:49:01,512 --> 01:49:04,807
- Who was that?
- Huh?

1596
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:06,767
Who was that?

1597
01:49:16,694 --> 01:49:20,781
Oh, just some guy I knew.

1598
01:49:34,086 --> 01:49:37,882
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight?

1599
01:49:39,216 --> 01:49:44,680
I was tappin' my foot on a Friday night

1600
01:49:44,764 --> 01:49:49,727
To my favorite band I was pushed aside

1601
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:54,732
I said hey, don't push me No, no, no one pushes me

1602
01:49:54,815 --> 01:49:59,737
When I was face to face with a woman I admired

1603
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,239
And she gave me this look

1604
01:50:02,364 --> 01:50:04,700
I could not believe

1605
01:50:04,784 --> 01:50:09,914
And the cold stare remained I wanted to leave

1606
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:17,588
Yeah, I do believe anger is offset by sorrow

1607
01:50:17,671 --> 01:50:22,468
But you destroy today you might regret tomorrow

1608
01:50:22,551 --> 01:50:25,179
When you're young and defensive

1609
01:50:25,221 --> 01:50:27,556
It comes off offensive

1610
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:32,561
And it's hard to repay the tolerance that you borrowed

1611
01:50:32,603 --> 01:50:37,775
The lasting relationship sinks right off the pier

1612
01:50:37,858 --> 01:50:42,446
Who wears the pants It's faded but clear

1613
01:50:44,949 --> 01:50:49,412
She's your girlfriend and she ain't too fond of me

1614
01:50:49,453 --> 01:50:55,167
I guess if that's the way it was meant to be

1615
01:50:55,251 --> 01:51:00,131
There we were just we three

1616
01:51:00,214 --> 01:51:03,884
You, your girlfriend and me

1617
01:51:26,949 --> 01:51:31,912
I've known you forever You two just met

1618
01:51:31,954 --> 01:51:36,542
So easily amused how fast we forget

1619
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:41,756
Ain't my jealousy
my self-righteous greed

1620
01:51:41,797 --> 01:51:46,594
She's a bit like a book I'm too farsighted to read

1621
01:51:46,635 --> 01:51:51,640
And I wish you the best but sometimes feel the need

1622
01:51:51,724 --> 01:51:55,936
To say Remember me

1623
01:51:58,439 --> 01:52:03,819
Yeah, she's your girlfriend as far as we can see

1624
01:52:03,903 --> 01:52:08,824
Does she look at you the way she looks at me

1625
01:52:08,866 --> 01:52:13,954
And here we are just we three

1626
01:52:14,038 --> 01:52:18,542
You, your girlfriend and me

1627
01:52:20,836 --> 01:52:25,674
She's your girlfriend it's gettin' harder to see

1628
01:52:25,758 --> 01:52:30,554
Better just take her home Better just let her be

1629
01:52:30,638 --> 01:52:35,851
When she walks out that door you come looking for me

1630
01:52:49,949 --> 01:52:52,493
Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

1631
01:52:52,535 --> 01:52:55,162
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.
