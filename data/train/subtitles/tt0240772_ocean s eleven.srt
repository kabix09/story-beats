1
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:07,758
One con under escort. Open gate one.

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,597
Man walking.

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,433
Open gate two.

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,108
Let's go. Face the wall.
Got one under escort.

5
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,752
- Good morning.
- Morning.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,547
- State your name for the record.
- Daniel Ocean.

7
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,718
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

8
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:54,013
whether you are
likely to break the law again.

9
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:59,143
This was your first conviction,
but you were implicated...

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,812
In a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

11
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,607
What can you tell us about this?

12
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,402
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

13
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,489
We're trying to find out...

14
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,617
if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,787
or just a reason
you got caught this time.

16
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:22,833
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

17
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:28,631
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

18
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,427
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

19
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:38,015
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

20
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,435
- Chips, please.
- Sure.

21
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:11,233
- Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
- Quarters are fine.

22
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,030
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,458
Twenty. Dealer has 19. Good start.

24
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,299
- I'm going on break now.
- Here. Thank you very much.

25
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,428
- Good luck.
- You have a good one.

26
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,224
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, Frank.

27
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:51,857
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

28
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:55,903
My name is Ramon.
As you can see right here.

29
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,076
- My mistake.
- No problem, sir.

30
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,995
The table's cold anyway.

31
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:09,792
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,836
- 1:007?
- Yes, Sir.

33
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,505
Thanks, Ramon.

34
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,216
Thank you.

35
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:30,646
- Checking up on current events??
- Ramon.

36
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:35,818
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

37
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,362
- You just got out?
- This afternoon.

38
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,030
You seen him?

39
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:45,369
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

40
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,705
You have a plan already?

41
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,167
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

42
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,710
Officer Brooks...

43
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,673
this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

44
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,510
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

45
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,222
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

46
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,560
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

47
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,244
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

48
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,502
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

49
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,464
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager...

50
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:42,426
- Bernie?
- Not Bernie. My business manager.

51
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,429
Actually, they're both named Bernie.

52
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:49,767
He said what we do could
be considered research...

53
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:54,063
for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

54
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,108
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

55
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,320
but I'd have to pay you by check.

56
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,786
Or we could just stick to cash.

57
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,622
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

58
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,342
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

59
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,470
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

60
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,308
Josh. To the left.

61
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,102
Deal to your left.

62
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,895
- Shane?
- Hit me.

63
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,815
- It's not blackjack.
- Dude!

64
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:42,152
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

65
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,448
- Left. Left.
- Left, I'll get it.

66
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,784
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

67
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,495
- Blue.
- Blue, that's a 50.

68
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,414
- I'll call?
- Okay.

69
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,666
Shane's calling. 50.

70
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,794
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

71
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,756
Betting's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

72
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,341
Yeah, thanks, man.

73
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,677
- Right.
- How many?

74
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,931
- Four.
- You don't want four. You wanna fold.

75
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,850
- Wanna fold?
- Fold.

76
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,518
Is that good?

77
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,105
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

78
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,483
You're done. You have three pairs.

79
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,362
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

80
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,740
- Maybe one was mine.
- Wasn't me.

81
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,033
Fellas!

82
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,369
All reds.

83
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,289
What up, dog?

84
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:45,382
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

85
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,066
- How's the game going?
- Longest hour of my life.

86
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,904
- What?
- I'm running away with your wife.

87
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,864
Great.

88
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,044
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

89
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,213
Not for me, dude.

90
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,092
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

91
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,302
if that's cool with you.

92
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:36,558
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

93
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,019
Why would I mind you asking?

94
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,604
Two cards.

95
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,399
I just got out of prison.

96
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,112
- Really?
- Why were you in prison?

97
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,739
I stole things.

98
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,451
You stole things? Like jewels?

99
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,955
Incan matrimonial head masks.

100
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,960
- Any money in Incan matrimonial...?
- Head masks. Some.

101
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,256
Don't let him fool you. There's
loads if you can move them.

102
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,719
- I'll take one. But you can't.
- My fence seemed confident.

103
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,389
- With cash you don't need a fence.
- Some lack vision.

104
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,975
Probably everybody in cellblock E.

105
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,977
That's $500.

106
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,606
- What's the first lesson in poker?
- Never bet on the...

107
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,443
- No, leave emotion at the door.
- Right.

108
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,446
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

109
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,865
That much money early in the game...

110
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,493
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

111
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,162
Barry?

112
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,499
All right.

113
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,710
I fold.

114
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,381
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

115
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,344
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

116
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,390
- $500 of my own.
- That's a very handsome bet.

117
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,313
Careful, don't push him too high,
too fast. Keep him on the leash.

118
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,523
- Holly?
- Call.

119
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,692
Call.

120
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,195
And I'll call.

121
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,535
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

122
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,706
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

123
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:28,128
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

124
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,216
- Josh?
- Two.

125
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,972
Thattagirl. Call.

126
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,184
- Call.
- Call.

127
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,772
Let's see them.

128
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,861
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

129
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,323
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

130
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,912
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

131
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,473
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

132
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,936
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

133
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,439
Why do you think I
came to see you first?

134
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,609
- So tell me.
- It's tricky.

135
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:37,489
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

136
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,785
- Guns?
- Not quite. High security. The take...

137
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,121
- The target?
- Eight figures.

138
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,164
What's the target?

139
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,836
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

140
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,839
You want to knock over a casino?

141
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,146
The vault at the Bellagio.

142
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,988
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

143
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,910
this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

144
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,079
You said three casinos?

145
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,210
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

146
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,589
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

147
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,760
- These are Terry Benedict's places.
- Yes, they are.

148
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,263
- Think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

149
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,601
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

150
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,478
Like what, you think?

151
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:54,942
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

152
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,527
a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

153
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,698
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

154
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,785
Where will you get
the money to back this?

155
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,080
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

156
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,707
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

157
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,753
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

158
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,633
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

159
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,343
Hey.

160
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,930
Oscar, lower it a bit, would you?

161
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,600
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

162
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,895
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

163
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,065
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

164
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,824
What?

165
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,910
I need a reason.

166
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,205
And don't say money. Why do this?

167
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,456
Why not do it?

168
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,466
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

169
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,761
and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

170
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,932
Because the house always wins.

171
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,310
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

172
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,150
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

173
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,031
- You practiced that speech?
- Did I rush it?

174
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,783
It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

175
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,789
I wonder what Reuben will say.

176
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,460
You're out of your damn minds!

177
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,963
You're both of you nuts!

178
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,635
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

179
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,721
And it cannot be beaten.

180
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,099
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

181
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,143
They got timers, vaults.

182
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,147
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

183
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,192
Okay, bad example.

184
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,110
It's never been tried.

185
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:07,783
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

186
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,661
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

187
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,914
Number three, the bronze medal.

188
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,250
Pencil neck grabs a
lockbox at the Horseshoe.

189
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,669
Grab the guy in the suit!

190
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,299
He got two steps closer to
the door than anyone before.

191
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,675
Leave the money!

192
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,844
Second most successful robbery:

193
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,557
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

194
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,434
before they grabbed him.

195
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:39,815
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

196
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,858
Goddamn hippie.

197
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,362
And the closest any man
has ever come...

198
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,614
to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

199
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,867
was outside of Caesars in '87.

200
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,036
He came...

201
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,372
he grabbed...

202
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,041
they conquered.

203
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,884
But what am I saying? You guys
are pros. The best.

204
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,096
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

205
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,723
Of course, lest we forget...

206
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:19,104
once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

207
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,314
You're right. He's right.

208
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,234
Our eyes were bigger than
our stomachs.

209
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,445
- That's what it is. Ego.
- Yeah, blah, blah.

210
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,615
- Thanks for lunch.
- The nicoise was delicious.

211
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,327
- Sorry to bother you.
- Look, we go way back...

212
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,747
and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

213
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,625
- Our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

214
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:45,589
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

215
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:52,637
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

216
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,267
The Bellagio, the Mirage and
the MGM Grand.

217
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,771
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

218
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,108
- Is that right?
- That's right.

219
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,277
You guys...

220
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,698
what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

221
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,118
What do you have against
him, is the question.

222
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:20,415
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

223
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:26,087
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

224
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,966
- I see what you're doing.
- What are we doing?

225
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,889
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

226
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,227
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

227
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,312
But Benedict...

228
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:47,150
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

229
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,239
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

230
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,701
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

231
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,328
Well-funded.

232
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,498
You gotta be nuts too.

233
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,002
And you're gonna need a
crew as nuts as you are.

234
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,091
Who do you got in mind?

235
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,345
- Alright, who's in?
- Frank C. is in.

236
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,226
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

237
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:27,983
Drivers?

238
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,860
- I talked to the Malloys.
- Mormon twins?

239
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,530
They're in Utah, off the job.

240
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,200
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

241
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,926
- Waiting, sweetheart.
- Good. Go.

242
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,511
- I'm waiting.
- Why?

243
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,596
- You're a little girl!
- Relax.

244
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,351
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

245
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,894
Relax.

246
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,101
- Electronics?
- Livingston Dell.

247
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:49,439
He's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

248
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,275
- How are his nerves?
- Not so bad.

249
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,569
Move in a little bit.

250
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,200
- Don't... Don't touch that.
- Why not?

251
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,871
Do you see me grabbing your
gun and waving it around?

252
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,624
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

253
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,718
Munitions.

254
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,970
- Phil Turrentine.
- Dead.

255
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,973
- No shit. On the job?
- Skin cancer.

256
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,268
- You send flowers?
- Dated his wife for a while.

257
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,604
Basher's in town.

258
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,233
There may be an issue
with availability.

259
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,157
All right, chaps...

260
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,452
hang on to your knickers.

261
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,848
Oh, leave it out!

262
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,687
You tossers! You had one job to do!

263
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,277
That's all you used in the event?

264
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,114
- You accusing me of booby-trapping?
- Well?

265
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:25,201
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

266
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,162
Basher?

267
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,539
Peck. ATF.

268
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,541
Let me venture a guess.

269
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:37,213
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

270
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,884
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

271
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,220
for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

272
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,972
Stand back.

273
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,807
Here we go.

274
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,602
- Find Griggs. I need him.
- Who?

275
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,729
Just find him, will you?

276
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:57,859
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

277
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,235
Done.

278
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,823
- Is Danny about?
- He's around the corner.

279
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,952
Terrific. It'll be nice working with
proper villains again.

280
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,580
Everybody down! Get down!

281
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,918
They weren't expecting that shit!

282
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,878
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

283
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,943
- Which one's the Amazing Yen?
- The little Chinese guy.

284
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,450
- Who else is on the list?
- He is the list.

285
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,123
It doesn't seem that diff...

286
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,469
- We got a grease man.
- We got a grease man.

287
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,976
We need Saul.

288
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,980
- He got out of the game a year ago.
- He get religion?

289
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,648
Ulcers.

290
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,153
- You could ask him.
- Hey, I could ask him.

291
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,018
I saw you at the paddock...

292
00:23:55,351 --> 00:24:00,356
before the second race, outside the
men's room when I placed my bet.

293
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,694
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

294
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,364
- How you been, Saul?
- Never better.

295
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,450
What's with the orange?

296
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:15,288
- My doctor says I need vitamins.
- Why don't you take vitamins?

297
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,082
You come here to give me a physical?

298
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,543
Box seats. Come on.

299
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:37,685
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

300
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,689
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

301
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,734
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

302
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,403
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

303
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,741
I'm seeing a lady who works the
counter at Macy's.

304
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,493
I've changed.

305
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:01,668
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

306
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,920
Quit conning me.

307
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,547
That your hound way in the rear?

308
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,592
He breaks late. Everyone knows this.

309
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,724
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

310
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,018
Tell me what the scam is?

311
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:52,552
Exhibit C: His belt as
king of the heavyweight crown.

312
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,973
Lennox Lewis has proved
he's the champion.

313
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,270
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

314
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,481
You think we need one more?

315
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,443
You think we need one more.

316
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,780
Alright, we'll get one more.

317
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,070
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

318
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,574
- Who are you?
- A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

319
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:43,246
You're either in or out. Right now.

320
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,253
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

321
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:55,258
- You're pretty trusting.
- Bobby has faith in you.

322
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,760
Fathers are like that.

323
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,181
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

324
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,017
Do this job, he'll be
trading on yours.

325
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,813
Don't, and you can go back to
feeling up stockbrokers.

326
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,315
Can you get the check, please?

327
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,821
That's the best lift you've made yet.

328
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,781
Las Vegas?

329
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,783
America's playground.

330
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,916
Did you guys get a group
rate or something?

331
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,716
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

332
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,678
Not as often as I'd like.

333
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:27,850
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

334
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,019
I'll look into it.

335
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,650
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

336
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,860
Everybody sober?

337
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,949
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

338
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,787
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

339
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,706
If that's not your brand of vodka...

340
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:55,670
eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

341
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,630
Otherwise, come with me.

342
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,183
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

343
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,646
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,191
- You like it there?
- Yeah.

345
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,404
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

346
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,083
The 3000 block of
Las Vegas Boulevard...

347
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,795
also known as the
Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand.

348
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:42,258
They're three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

349
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,430
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

350
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,433
beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

351
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,730
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

352
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,025
- We're gonna rob it.
- Smash-and-grab job?

353
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,694
Slightly more complicated than that.

354
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,988
Well, yeah.

355
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:09,785
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

356
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,537
Bad news first.

357
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:16,083
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

358
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:21,380
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

359
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,091
Next, through these doors...

360
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,763
each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

361
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,683
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

362
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:37,563
- It won't move without fingerprint I.D.
- Which we can't fake.

363
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:42,777
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

364
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,528
Which we won't get.

365
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,782
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

366
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,787
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

367
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,457
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

368
00:31:56,665 --> 00:32:00,002
Just two more guards with Uzis...

369
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,006
and the most elaborate vault
door ever conceived.

370
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,342
Any questions?

371
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,013
Tunneling's out. There are...

372
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,060
sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

373
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,897
- Anyone else?
- You mentioned good news?

374
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,192
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

375
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,364
a casino to keep enough cash to
cover every chip in play on the floor.

376
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,034
That means on a weekday
it must carry...

377
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,329
between $60 and $70 million in
cash and coin.

378
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:39,500
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

379
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,795
like in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

380
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,382
$150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

381
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,594
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

382
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,429
You do the math.

383
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,140
Exactly.

384
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,724
I have a question.

385
00:32:56,225 --> 00:33:00,354
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

386
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,940
down the elevator
we can't move...

387
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:07,319
past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open...

388
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,074
- And not seen by cameras.
- Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

389
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,077
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

390
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:19,915
we're just supposed to walk out of
there with $150 million...

391
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,710
without getting stopped?

392
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,008
Yeah.

393
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,597
Oh. Okay.

394
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,608
First task: reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...

395
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,694
In all casinos, from
the dealers' rotation...

396
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:54,909
to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

397
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,619
This girl Charmaine...

398
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:01,373
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

399
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,793
Dances at Crazy Horse Too.
It pays for her school.

400
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,214
- I think she really likes me.
- Cool.

401
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:17,348
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

402
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,350
Know the quick routes out.

403
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:23,145
- He went through at 10:44.
- 10:46. Get a watch that works.

404
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,857
- You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
- 10:46.

405
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,572
Second task: power.

406
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,618
<i>On fight night, we'll throw
the switch on Sin City.</i>

407
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,664
- Basher, it's your show.
- You want broke, blind or bedlam?

408
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,209
- How about all three?
- Right, it's done.

409
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,462
Third task: surveillance.

410
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,674
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

411
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,802
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

412
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,138
It's not the least accessible
system I've seen.

413
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,850
- There's no closed-circuit to tap into?
- No.

414
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:07,022
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

415
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,276
Two. And one of them is lonely.

416
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,876
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

417
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:32,381
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

418
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,822
Watch it, bud!

419
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,908
- You call me bud, pal?
- You call me pal, friend?

420
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,079
- You call me friend, jackass?
- Don't call me jackass.

421
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:09,626
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

422
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,713
Copy that. I see them.

423
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:46,121
- Is that a word? You made that up?
- "Obsequious” is a word.

424
00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:00,636
- Sir, please move your balloons.
- You got in my way!

425
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,931
- I was trying to deliver balloons!
- Gentlemen!

426
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,852
- He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
- You're spitting in my face.

427
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,540
And we're up and running.

428
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:35,838
- Why are hallways always that color?
- They say taupe is very soothing.

429
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,176
- Hi.
- Fine, thanks.

430
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,940
- Move the balloons.
- Move them?

431
00:37:55,149 --> 00:38:00,320
An important client is waiting for
these. I don't have time...

432
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,906
for you circus animals.

433
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,859
Hey! Hold up a minute!

434
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,278
Excuse me!

435
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,406
Hey! Excuse me!

436
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,162
- Hey, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

437
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,665
- How's the reception on those things?
- Excellent.

438
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,336
- Take care.
- Thanks.

439
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:06,261
- Well...
- Yeah.

440
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,057
Fourth task: construction.

441
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,353
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

442
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,523
- To practice?
- Something like that.

443
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,652
Fifth task: intelligence.
We need those codes, Linus...

444
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,946
from the guy who has all three.

445
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,449
- Who, Benedict?
- Learn to love his shadow.

446
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:32,371
- All I get to do is watch the guy?
- Gotta walk before you crawl.

447
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,250
- Reverse that.
- Sixth task: transport.

448
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:45,592
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

449
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,554
Well, I understand.

450
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:53,725
- They are some great-looking vans.
- Yes, sir, top of the line.

451
00:39:54,768 --> 00:40:00,148
- Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
- Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

452
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,404
- Denham like a jean.
- That's it. Just like the jean.

453
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:10,534
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

454
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,287
- I'm sorry?
- I've tried lots of lotion.

455
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:17,624
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

456
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:22,170
she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

457
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,842
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

458
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:33,015
but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

459
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:38,895
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

460
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,608
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

461
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,110
| could drop that
down to seven...

462
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,279
Sixteen each.

463
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,531
- No?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,450
- You'd do that?
- Yes, Sir.

465
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,244
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

466
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,914
- Well, I'm glad they did.
- They told me.

467
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:03,587
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

468
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,380
- You do that.
- Thank you.

469
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:17,476
- Very nice material.
- It's imported silk, Saul.

470
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,645
It's very nice.

471
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:26,234
Gentlemen, would you excuse us
for a second? Thanks.

472
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,246
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

473
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,337
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

474
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,382
you won't wake up
the following morning.

475
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,471
He's ready.

476
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,019
My name is Lyman...

477
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,854
Zerga.

478
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,858
My name is Lyman Zerga.

479
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,030
My name is Lyman Zerga.

480
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,222
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

481
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,849
That guy's a machine.

482
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,350
Good afternoon.

483
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,229
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

484
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,981
How are you, Tommy?

485
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,191
He remembers every valet's name.

486
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,862
Not bad for a guy worth
3/4 of a billion.

487
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,741
He works hard, hits the
lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

488
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,076
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

489
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:01,496
- Talks with his casino manager.
- About what?

490
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:02,664
All business.

491
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,626
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

492
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:11,923
There's rarely an incident he doesn't
know about or handle personally.

493
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,095
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

494
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:23,685
He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.

495
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,107
He's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

496
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:34,613
<i>Contents: profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.</i>

497
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,788
Like I said, a machine.

498
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,583
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

499
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,462
And two minutes after they're changed,
he's got them.

500
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:56,802
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

501
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,389
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

502
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,392
he seized his house and
bankrupted his...

503
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,144
In-law's dealership.

504
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,982
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

505
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,567
You scared?

506
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,569
You suicidal?

507
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,989
Only in the morning.

508
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,700
- Now what?
- Now comes the girl.

509
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,913
She comes down after him
if they're in a snit.

510
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,668
- Where does she come from?
- The museum, there. She's the curator.

511
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,004
Here she is.

512
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,342
This is the best part of my day.

513
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:55,318
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

514
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,320
Tess.

515
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,489
Huh?

516
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,366
Her name is Tess.

517
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,725
- We have to talk. Now.
- Okay.

518
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,900
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

519
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,693
Who?

520
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:39,821
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

521
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,116
- the guy who's screwing your wife.
- Ex-wife.

522
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:45,702
- Tell me.
- It's not about that.

523
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:53,251
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

524
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,713
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

525
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,757
Well, I lost something.

526
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:03,595
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

527
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,728
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

528
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:16,232
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

529
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,277
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

530
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:25,200
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

531
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,415
- How'd she look?
- She looked good.

532
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:33,959
Thanks.

533
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,825
You like it?

534
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,454
I like that you like it.

535
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,626
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

536
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,429
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

537
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,432
I'll see you tonight.

538
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,198
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

539
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:51,870
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

540
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,789
I don't believe in questions either.

541
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,209
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

542
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:02,130
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

543
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,257
He doesn't fool around.

544
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,468
- How are you, Eddie?
- Fine, sir.

545
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,969
Anything for me?

546
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:12,640
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

547
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,977
Who is he?

548
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:19,147
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

549
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:23,693
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

550
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:25,987
- One of the biggest.
- Zerga.

551
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,822
Yes, sir.

552
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:31,868
- Never heard of him.
- That's why I don't doubt it.

553
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:35,914
- He's staying here?
- He's in the Mirador suite.

554
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,918
- How's he doing?
- Up, almost 200.

555
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,338
Good for him.

556
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:02,732
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search...

557
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,735
Hello, Tess.

558
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,905
What are you doing here?

559
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:11,449
I'm out.

560
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,368
- Out?
- Of prison.

561
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:16,871
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

562
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,916
I don't smoke. Don't sit.

563
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:25,755
- Supposedly I paid my debt to society.
- Funny, I never got a check.

564
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,424
You're not wearing your ring.

565
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,346
I sold it. I don't have a husband
or didn't you get the papers?

566
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:37,183
- My last day inside.
- I told you I'd write.

567
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:45,316
- Danny, go now before...
- What? Benedict?

568
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,487
How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey.

569
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:55,493
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

570
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:59,747
- Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
- Remind you of anyone?

571
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:04,961
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

572
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,547
- Monet.
- And Manet had syphilis.

573
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,466
They also painted occasionally.

574
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,806
All right, I'll make this quick.

575
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:18,850
I came here for you.

576
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:24,105
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

577
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,608
You're a thief and a liar.

578
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:30,445
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

579
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,447
- Steal?
- Lie.

580
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,700
I'm with someone who
doesn't have to make...

581
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:39,078
- that kind of distinction.
- He's clear on both.

582
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,623
- You have a problem.
- Only one?

583
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:47,128
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

584
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,508
Does he make you laugh?

585
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:57,138
He doesn't make me cry.

586
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,405
- The fight is Saturday night?
- Yes, would you like tickets?

587
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:18,368
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

588
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:22,080
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

589
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:25,166
A black briefcase, standard size...

590
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,921
the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

591
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,049
I'll put it in the house safe.

592
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:37,345
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

593
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:43,017
- I need something more secure.
- Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our...

594
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:48,106
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

595
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,192
will not go overlooked.

596
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:57,240
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

597
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:02,620
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

598
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,709
I left New York to escape what
happened. Can I get five years back?

599
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:12,088
- What you can do is not throw...
- You don't know anything.

600
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:16,050
You don't love me,
you're with someone else, fine.

601
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,178
I have to live with that.
But not him.

602
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:21,723
Just like an ex-husband.

603
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,309
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing.

604
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,437
There's a conflict of interest
when you...

605
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:32,817
- give me advice about my love life.
- But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

606
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,239
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

607
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,578
- That I better know what I'm doing.
- Do you? Now?

608
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:46,164
You should go if you don't.

609
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:48,124
I know what I'm doing.

610
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,667
What are you doing?

611
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,004
Just catching up.

612
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,715
- Meet my ex-husband.
- Danny Ocean.

613
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,509
- Mr. Ocean.
- I'm in your seat.

614
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:02,638
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

615
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:07,143
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

616
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:09,437
- Is that so?
- Imagine the odds.

617
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:12,482
Of all the gin joints
in all the world.

618
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,318
You recently were
released from prison?

619
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,527
That's right.

620
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:19,822
- How does it feel to be out?
- About the same.

621
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:25,703
- Danny was just about to...
- I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

622
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,121
Stay, have a drink.

623
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,040
- I can't.
- He can't.

624
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,046
Well, then...

625
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,342
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

626
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,968
You never know.

627
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:44,222
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

628
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,183
So I should put
those towels back.

629
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,852
No, the towels you can keep.

630
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,860
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Take care, Danny.

631
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,238
- Terry.
- Danny.

632
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,241
Stinking...

633
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,951
Tomorrow the day is yours.

634
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,623
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

635
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:37,627
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

636
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,965
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

637
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:48,471
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

638
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,988
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...

639
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,993
and its elevator shut down for
two minutes. That's when we go.

640
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:19,126
You're in the middle of the
room, 10 feet from everything.

641
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:23,172
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

642
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,007
What do you do?

643
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,511
- Ten says he shorts it.
- Twenty.

644
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:38,187
Window or aisle, boys?

645
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,691
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

646
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:45,695
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

647
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,115
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

648
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,493
- You understand him?
- I'll explain later.

649
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:57,039
They're so pony they blew the
backup grids one by one.

650
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,833
Basher, what happened?

651
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,670
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

652
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,507
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

653
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:11,679
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

654
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,058
Barney Rubble. Trouble!

655
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,523
- We could always...
- By tomorrow?

656
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:27,069
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

657
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,699
What's a pinch?

658
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:36,746
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

659
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,541
Better yet, a pinch is a
bomb without the bomb.

660
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:44,879
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

661
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,299
shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

662
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:53,429
It usually doesn't matter because a
nuclear weapon destroys everything.

663
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:57,224
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

664
00:57:57,433 --> 00:58:01,854
without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

665
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:04,482
- the 17th century.
- How long?

666
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,775
30 seconds.

667
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,946
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

668
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:14,116
- Like, for instance...
- Las Vegas?

669
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,162
Yeah, I think it might.

670
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:21,749
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

671
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,125
Where?

672
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,641
Let's go. Yen, Basher, come on.

673
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,476
Where you going?

674
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,436
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

675
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:45,981
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

676
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,450
Start.

677
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,828
- I got one.
- You thinking of one?

678
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,498
- No, I've thought of one.
- You're thinking of one.

679
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,792
No, I'm done. I have it.

680
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,502
- You a man?
- Yes. 19.

681
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:08,129
- You alive?
- Yes. 18.

682
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,798
- Evel Knievel.
- Shit!

683
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,675
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

684
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,469
- Your hand's in my face.
- It's not.

685
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,639
- Am I touching you?
- Your hand's in my face.

686
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,641
- Move.
- I didn't touch you.

687
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,936
- You just touched me.
- You made me touch you.

688
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,814
This is your side.
This is your side.

689
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,151
Get off. Get off.

690
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,973
I'm gonna need a score of
car batteries...

691
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:04,477
Where's Linus? Where's Linus?

692
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,489
- There he is.
- Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

693
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,085
Should someone help him?

694
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:34,381
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

695
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,930
Back it up.

696
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,573
Let him in.

697
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,416
You stupid bastard!

698
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,174
- I say stay, you stay.
- Got it.

699
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:20,594
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

700
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,221
I got it.

701
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,269
Where are they?

702
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,523
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

703
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,527
- They will be here.
- "They will be here." Schmuck!

704
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,161
You boys have a nice trip?

705
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,757
We have a problem.

706
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,677
You've been red-flagged.

707
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:05,723
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

708
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:10,019
Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.

709
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,689
That's a problem.

710
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,650
- Saul, turn that off.
- When I'm ready...

711
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,237
- Saul!
- It's off! It's off!

712
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,950
Any idea how this happened?

713
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,828
- No.
- Oh, come on.

714
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:32,917
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

715
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:36,211
- Tailed you.
- Who told you to?

716
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,548
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

717
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:41,008
- Tess?
- My wife.

718
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,677
- Ex-wife.
- Tess is here?

719
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,433
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

720
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,685
- You're out, Danny.
- He's out?

721
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:55,522
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

722
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,902
- It's not your call.
- You put her before us and made it mine.

723
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,904
This is my job.

724
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:03,405
Not anymore.

725
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:07,076
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

726
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,078
Kid, you up for it?

727
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,210
I can do it.

728
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:20,214
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

729
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,132
Curtain goes up at 7.

730
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:27,304
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

731
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,058
Yes. No.

732
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,269
Very much no.

733
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:42,319
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

734
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:46,407
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

735
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,162
Hi.

736
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,001
What were you thinking about?

737
01:03:58,252 --> 01:03:59,461
You.

738
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,925
Where you gonna put your hands?

739
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,054
No good.

740
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:13,267
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

741
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,979
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

742
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:22,192
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

743
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:25,195
Don't use seven words if four will do.

744
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:30,826
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

745
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:34,830
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

746
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,125
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't...

747
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,627
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

748
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,254
Sure.

749
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,272
Saul?

750
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:06,945
It's time.

751
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:26,882
Okay.

752
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,592
Let's do it.

753
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,807
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...

754
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:39,061
with the expected crowd of
celebrities and sports fans...

755
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:44,233
piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...

756
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:50,364
prepare to meet after an
eight-month dance toward each other.

757
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,284
Mr. Zerga?

758
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:56,453
Mr. Benedict.

759
01:05:56,703 --> 01:06:01,917
- I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
- I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

760
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,296
My courier should be here momentarily.

761
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:30,571
Eighteen. Blackjack!

762
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:48,422
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

763
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:54,553
I can't have private security personnel
in the casino cages.

764
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,096
Of course not.

765
01:06:57,598 --> 01:07:00,601
Saul! Saul Bloom, is that you?

766
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,104
Saul! Saul, it's me! Bucky Buchanan!

767
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,648
Remember? From Saratoga!

768
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,237
Mikael. Viadimir.

769
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:16,074
Hey! Hey, Saul! Saul!

770
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,620
Mr. Benedict, please.

771
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:24,124
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

772
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,217
Lift them up, please.

773
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:46,480
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

774
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:50,567
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

775
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:52,736
for a period of 24 hours.

776
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:56,615
- I cannot allow you into the vault.
- Why not?

777
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:02,329
Insurance, for one. Security. But,
most of all, I just don't trust you.

778
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,040
Excuse me.

779
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:13,674
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

780
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,719
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

781
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:22,349
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

782
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,977
Those are my terms. Yes or no?

783
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,147
You leave me no choice.

784
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:35,404
Dude, don't do that in
front of the pinch.

785
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,327
Deep breaths. You'll do fine.

786
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:26,121
- Thank you.
- No sweat. You're a natural.

787
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,540
But don't screw up.

788
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:38,592
- Who gets the penne?
- Right here.

789
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:45,849
You ready?

790
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:52,606
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

791
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,609
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

792
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:57,361
Don't let me keep you.

793
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,322
- Mr. Zerga.
- Mr. Benedict.

794
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,080
Linus, you're up.

795
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,582
Got him.

796
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,459
Mr. Benedict.

797
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,171
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

798
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,882
I need two minutes of your time.

799
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,135
- Anything for the NGC.
- Thanks.

800
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:25,180
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

801
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:47,035
- You make the deposit when?
- At your signal.

802
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:51,248
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

803
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,876
How does that feel?
You all right?

804
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,838
Want something to read?
A magazine?

805
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,048
All right. Counting down.

806
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:03,718
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

807
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:07,055
This just came to our attention today.

808
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:10,350
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my...

809
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,894
It's long.

810
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,067
If he is who you say he is.

811
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,533
You been at the commission long?

812
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:31,204
- About 18 months.
- You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

813
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,584
Not since he died last year.

814
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:44,050
Ramon Escalante”? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

815
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:45,927
What's going on here?

816
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:50,724
- It's come to our attention...
- We should speak off the floor.

817
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,601
Charlie.

818
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,291
Thank you.

819
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:21,630
- No. I want you out of here.
- Give me one moment.

820
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:25,425
- I've had it. I want you gone.
- Tess, come here.

821
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:27,385
You're up to something.

822
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:31,723
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

823
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:35,268
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

824
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:38,146
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

825
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,655
Goodbye.

826
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,671
You be good.

827
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,393
- Mr. Ocean.
- Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

828
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,603
I thought he might.

829
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:25,026
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

830
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:30,156
You're Frank Catton, of
the Tropicana, the Desert Inn...

831
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:34,619
and the New York state
penitentiary system. Are you not?

832
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:40,500
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

833
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,005
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know...

834
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,381
Goddamn cracker.

835
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:52,012
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

836
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,181
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

837
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,810
- You wanna throw me on the street.
- I'm doing my job.

838
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,855
Want me to get on the table and dance?

839
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,524
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

840
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:10,238
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it white jack!

841
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:17,704
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

842
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:21,458
- Yeah, right.
- What a horrible thing to say!

843
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:28,882
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored...

844
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:33,136
- No! I didn't mean it!
- Okay. Come on, sit down.

845
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,264
- Sit down.
- You better talk to him.

846
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,309
- He's got it.
- Sit down.

847
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,270
Virgil. Turk. Deliver the package.

848
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,451
- Where's your card?
- I lost it.

849
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,453
- You serious?
- I'm so stupid.

850
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:01,414
- You are so stupid! You know that?
- Hey!

851
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:05,418
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

852
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:09,381
- Hey! Keep it down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

853
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:13,259
- Where did this come from?
- High roller's room.

854
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:17,013
- It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
- Joe, take this inside.

855
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,934
- Count room?
- No, to the vault.

856
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,603
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

857
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:28,400
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

858
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:30,652
- Stupid.
- Jeez!

859
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:39,494
Yo! Hold that, please.

860
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:46,292
- There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
- Wonderful.

861
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,842
That's my cue.

862
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,886
Give Basher the go.

863
01:15:57,804 --> 01:15:59,514
Bash, what's your status?

864
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:03,226
- Bash!
- Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor.

865
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:06,438
- What's your status?
- I'm nearly there.

866
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:26,207
Come on, come on.

867
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,296
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

868
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,507
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

869
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,009
Sir?

870
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:39,345
- Cracker!
- Oh, dear God!

871
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:52,192
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

872
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:55,320
- Know the way back?
- I do.

873
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,654
Good.

874
01:16:57,197 --> 01:16:59,157
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

875
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,868
Sorry!

876
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:11,044
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

877
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:23,640
No cameras in this room, huh?

878
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,559
Yeah.

879
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:31,272
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

880
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,152
He's not coming, is he?

881
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:50,458
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you two to talk things over.

882
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:57,423
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

883
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:01,594
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

884
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:05,098
That went well, but then
I went to this party...

885
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,605
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a.m...

886
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:16,693
So she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

887
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:20,613
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice.”

888
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:22,574
Oh, shit.

889
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:28,079
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

890
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:31,875
I am very satisfied.

891
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:39,507
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

892
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:42,927
All right.

893
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:49,017
Jesus!

894
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,936
Bruiser!

895
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:56,566
- Not until later!
- Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

896
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,318
It's all right.

897
01:19:00,028 --> 01:19:02,947
- How's your wife?
- Pregnant again.

898
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:07,493
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

899
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,943
- You're almost there, Linus.
- Who's that guy?

900
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:43,404
- I got a bogey in west corridor.
- Mr. Zerga!

901
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,204
- Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
- Put this under his head.

902
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,415
Going to video now.

903
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,960
To the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

904
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,754
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

905
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:12,600
Oh, Jesus!

906
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:18,272
- Did you really think I'd sit this out?
- You didn't trust me?

907
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,941
I do now.

908
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,151
Come on.

909
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:53,975
Someone call for a doctor?

910
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:06,946
- How'd you get here?
- Had to give a friend two million.

911
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:11,951
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

912
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:18,041
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

913
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:21,502
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

914
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,089
Come on, man! Breathe!

915
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,884
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

916
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:37,727
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

917
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:42,940
- Dude, I told you to hurry.
- Don't do that. Just don't.

918
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,026
I didn't tell you to hurry?

919
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,780
Come on, get up! Get up!

920
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,995
Had enough yet?

921
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:25,775
- These things are gonna hold us, right?
- They should.

922
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,543
Livingston, we're set.

923
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:47,213
- Livingston, we're set.
- Basher, we're set.

924
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:50,299
Hang on a minute, chief.

925
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:53,261
We don't have one.
Yen's gonna suffocate.

926
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,472
Then you should
leave off bothering me, okay?

927
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,407
All right, crack them.

928
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:07,960
Go.

929
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,052
Shit!

930
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,304
Cut it.

931
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:44,580
Hey!

932
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,502
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

933
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:53,256
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

934
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,561
Get your coat. Get your coat.

935
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:10,481
Look, this is crazy! What...?

936
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,567
Not yet. Not yet.

937
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,407
Go ahead.

938
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:07,580
- You think Yen made it out okay?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

939
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,416
How we doing?

940
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:14,253
Okay, I guess.

941
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:35,816
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $160 million behind this door.

942
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:38,277
- Let's get him out.
- Yeah.

943
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,165
- 10 says he shorts it.
- No bet.

944
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:53,125
Try him again.

945
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,242
Okay.

946
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:35,751
Hey. Where we at, boys?

947
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:40,005
- Pins and floor sensors, now.
- Blinding.

948
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,347
Here we go.

949
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,942
Counting down from 20. Now.

950
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:01,527
Twenty...

951
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:08,492
- Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
- Ten...

952
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,703
nine, eight...

953
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:15,082
- Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
- Do not blow the door!

954
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,045
Two, one.

955
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,472
What's wrong?

956
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,182
Something...

957
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:46,280
Did you check the batteries?

958
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:51,827
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second...

959
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:56,248
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

960
01:29:16,894 --> 01:29:18,354
Yen?

961
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,489
Where the fuck you been?

962
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,910
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

963
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:47,383
That is the sexiest thing
I've ever seen.

964
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:52,012
Rusty, you're up.

965
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,194
- You gonna answer that?
- I don't have a cell phone.

966
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:12,992
This isn't mine.

967
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,328
See who it is.

968
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:21,333
- Hello?
- May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

969
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,043
It's for you.

970
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:31,302
- Who the hell is this?
- The man who's robbing you.

971
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:41,562
- What's going on in the vault?
- Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

972
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,314
Show me.

973
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:48,360
- You're mistaken.
- Watching your monitors?

974
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:50,946
Okay, keep watching.

975
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:03,751
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

976
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,379
- Find out how much money's down there.
- Yes, sir.

977
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:25,731
Tess?

978
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,941
Tess?

979
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:30,611
Perhaps you should...

980
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:32,863
Perhaps I should what?

981
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:37,660
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

982
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:48,295
All right, you proved your point.

983
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:53,634
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

984
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:58,639
- Maybe.
- Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

985
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:02,810
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

986
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:07,147
- No. You'll carry it out for us.
- Why would I do that?

987
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,024
Look at your monitor.

988
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:15,364
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $160 million...

989
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:19,702
In your vault tonight.
We're only packing up half that.

990
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:24,123
The other half we're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

991
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:28,627
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

992
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:32,464
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

993
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:42,266
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $160 million publicly.

994
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:43,767
Your decision. Hi.

995
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:56,697
Make the call.

996
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:03,871
911 emergency response.

997
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,250
- Where's Danny?
- He's fine. He's in good form.

998
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:12,296
- He asks that you go up and watch TV.
- He does?

999
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:17,509
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

1000
01:33:20,304 --> 01:33:22,431
- Okay.
- It's alright, Tess.

1001
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:24,641
- You have a deal.
- I promise.

1002
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,311
Fantastic. Here's what you do:

1003
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:32,608
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

1004
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,693
It will rise to your cages.

1005
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:39,072
Three of your guards will carry
the bags out into the casino.

1006
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:45,037
If they take more than 20 seconds to
reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1007
01:33:45,204 --> 01:33:47,831
we'll blow all the money.

1008
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:52,920
- He's in the casino by the slots.
- Of course I am.

1009
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:58,634
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: mini bar.

1010
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,971
Once the guards
hit the casino floor...

1011
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:08,560
a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

1012
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:14,066
If anyone so much as approaches the
driver's door, we'll blow everything.

1013
01:34:15,484 --> 01:34:20,239
When I hear the van is away and
the money secure, my men will leave.

1014
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:24,076
Once their safely is confirmed,
you'll get your vault.

1015
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,578
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

1016
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,748
All right.

1017
01:34:29,957 --> 01:34:35,170
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1018
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:36,713
I would.

1019
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,050
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1020
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:44,638
Run and hide, asshole. Run and hide.

1021
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:49,893
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1022
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:55,399
I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1023
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:59,403
rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1024
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:04,408
So, my advice to you again
is this: run and hide.

1025
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:07,452
That is all that I ask.

1026
01:35:29,892 --> 01:35:34,479
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1027
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:38,233
I want my vault
back before that van hits the tarmac.

1028
01:35:48,619 --> 01:35:51,246
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

1029
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,001
Ready.

1030
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:00,672
Cutting power now.

1031
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:04,176
Do it.

1032
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:08,347
Breaching elevator doors now.

1033
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:12,351
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1034
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,186
Wait a minute.

1035
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:16,271
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1036
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,982
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1037
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:23,862
- Lights! We need power now!
- Give it to him.

1038
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,334
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1039
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:41,713
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

1040
01:36:41,922 --> 01:36:45,634
Continuing search for survivors.

1041
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:48,720
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1042
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:52,015
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1043
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,767
Yes, sir.

1044
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:15,414
Get out of the van, now. Now!

1045
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,712
Tires. Tires.

1046
01:37:38,562 --> 01:37:40,689
Our search yielded no suspects.

1047
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:45,027
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1048
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:50,490
- Take your men out.
- May I suggest you...?

1049
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,200
Now.

1050
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:55,620
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1051
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:06,465
Walsh, where are we with the van?

1052
01:38:24,775 --> 01:38:27,652
I just want to try
something for a second.

1053
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,323
There's nobody inside.

1054
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:37,954
- I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
- Enough monkey business.

1055
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:39,790
Do it already.

1056
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:58,350
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

1057
01:38:58,558 --> 01:38:59,559
And?

1058
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:03,105
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

1059
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:04,898
What do you mean?

1060
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:09,820
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

1061
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,285
Walsh?

1062
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:20,247
Cue up the tape to the robbery.

1063
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,543
Yes, sir. I'm looking at the tape now.

1064
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:28,880
Does it say "Bellagio”
on the vault floor?

1065
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:31,716
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1066
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,054
We had it installed Tuesday.

1067
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:39,891
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1068
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:41,434
What?

1069
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:47,357
It was staged.
Somebody made a duplicate of my vault.

1070
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:51,695
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1071
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:56,616
I don't understand.
What happened to all that money?

1072
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:08,503
Make the call.

1073
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:18,138
911 emergency response.

1074
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:24,060
- Night goggles on.
- Clear.

1075
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:25,729
Prepare to cut power.

1076
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:33,403
Breaching elevator doors now.

1077
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:36,990
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1078
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,366
Wait a minute.

1079
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:40,368
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1080
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:43,413
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1081
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,255
Open the door.

1082
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:43,515
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1083
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,355
Pick him up.

1084
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,533
Did you have a hand in this?

1085
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:05,120
Did I have my hand in what?

1086
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:11,793
I'll ask you one more time.

1087
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:14,296
Did you have your hand in this?

1088
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:21,177
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1089
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:27,058
Okay.

1090
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:30,103
You're free to go.

1091
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,982
Show him out.

1092
01:42:40,613 --> 01:42:43,283
- Hello.
- Turn to channel 88.

1093
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,243
Who is this?

1094
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:57,005
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

1095
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:58,715
Stop.

1096
01:43:09,726 --> 01:43:12,145
I'll give you one last chance.

1097
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,481
Where's my money?

1098
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,650
What if I said you could
get your money back...

1099
01:43:18,735 --> 01:43:20,779
if you'd give up Tess?

1100
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:23,281
What would you say?

1101
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,494
I would say yes.

1102
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,833
All right.

1103
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:38,838
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

1104
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:43,385
Anybody pulls any job in the
Western U.S., he knows about it.

1105
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,972
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1106
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,396
You know a guy.

1107
01:43:57,107 --> 01:44:02,028
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1108
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,738
Yes, sir.

1109
01:44:29,556 --> 01:44:31,099
Tess.

1110
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,519
Tess.

1111
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,689
You of all people should know, Terry.

1112
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:41,734
In your hotel,
there's always someone watching.

1113
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,753
Wait!

1114
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:25,922
Wait!

1115
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:30,385
Wait, that's my husband!

1116
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:37,225
- Danny.
- Tess, I told you...

1117
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,436
| knew what I was doing.

1118
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:42,855
I didn't.

1119
01:46:43,064 --> 01:46:44,816
All right, let's go.

1120
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:47,860
How long will you be?

1121
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,572
About three to six months, I guess.

1122
01:49:46,122 --> 01:49:48,040
I hope you were the groom.

1123
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:55,006
Ted Nugent called,
he wants his shirt back.

1124
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:07,018
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1125
01:50:07,226 --> 01:50:09,103
I blew it all on the suit.

1126
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:13,524
- Where are they?
- Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1127
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:17,445
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1128
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:22,450
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1129
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:34,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

1130
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:36,422
Rusty needs a girl.

1131
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:39,467
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1132
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:43,054
You said that you sold this.

1133
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:44,931
I said that.

1134
01:50:45,223 --> 01:50:46,682
Liar.

1135
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,811
Thief.
