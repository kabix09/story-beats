1
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23.977
[inhales]

2
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01.682
[shrill scream]

3
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11.959
[shrill scream]

4
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27.375
- WHERE ARE THEY?

5
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:31.078
- [distantly]
DAD! UNCLE MERRILL!

6
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34.382
- DAD!

7
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39.620
- MORGAN!

8
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:49.497
[birds crying]

9
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53.534
- BO? BO, BO.

10
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55.469
WHERE'S MORGAN?

11
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:59.039
BO.
- ARE YOU IN MY DREAM TOO?

12
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00.474
- THIS IS NOT A DR--
- DAD!

13
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02.142
- HEY!

14
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04.077
- HONEY...

15
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09.417
- MORGAN?

16
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10.651
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:15.088
- THE DOGS WERE BARKING--
WOKE US UP.

18
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17.625
- ARE YOU HURT?

19
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20.628
- I THINK GOD DID IT.

20
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23.431
- DID WHAT, MORGAN?

21
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43.951
[dogs barking distantly,
birds screeching]

22
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59.733
[barking, whimpering]

23
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45.012
LOOK, LEE, I DON'T EVEN CARE
IF IT WAS HIM.

24
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47.147
AND YOU CAN JUST
HAVE A WORD WITH HIM,

25
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49.517
AND THAT'D BE ENOUGH FOR ME.

26
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53.587
SEE, IT WAS STRANGE FINDING
THE CROPS THAT WAY.

27
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:57.024
THE KIDS WERE CONFUSED BY IT,
AND, UH,

28
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58.992
IT'D SURE TAKE
THE STRANGENESS AWAY

29
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01.429
IF I KNEW IT WAS JUST LIONEL
AND THE WOLFINGTON BROTHERS

30
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03.731
MESSING AROUND, THAT'S ALL.

31
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06.700
AT THE MOVIES?

32
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09.737
ARE YOU SURE?

33
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11.204
[sighing]
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

34
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13.607
UH, THANKS FOR
YOUR PATIENCE, LEE.

35
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14.708
YEAH.
BYE.

36
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16.043
[beep]

37
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22.783
- HOUDINI PEED.
I THINK HE'S SICK.

38
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25.118
- WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HIM OUTSIDE?

39
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28.021
I'LL CALL DR. CRAWFORD.
- HE DOESN'T TREAT ANIMALS.

40
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30.123
- WELL, HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

41
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48.742
OH.
THAT WAS QUICK, CAROLINE.

42
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50.611
I ONLY CALLED YOU FOLKS
TWO HOURS AGO.

43
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54.448
- OLD MRS. KENDLEMAN TWISTED
HER ANKLE, AS SHE PUTS IT,

44
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57.485
DIVING FOR HER LIFE
WHEN A BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS

45
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00.420
RODE DOWN THE SIDEWALK
ON SKATEBOARDS.

46
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02.756
SHE WENT DOWN TO THORNTON'S
STORE THIS MORNING

47
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06.627
AND STARTED SPITTING
ON THE NEW SKATEBOARDS.

48
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08.161
SPITTING!

49
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09.730
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,

50
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12.833
MRS. KENDLEMAN HAD SPRAYED
THE WHOLE DAMN PLACE.

51
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15.503
AND SHE MUST HAVE HAD
A COLD OR SOMETHING.

52
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18.706
I'M TELLING YOU,
I WON'T EAT FOR A WEEK.

53
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25.045
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CROPS?

54
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30.884
- DAD'S GONNA BURN THESE AGAIN.

55
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41.428
- IT'S CONTAMINATED.

56
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43.864
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.

57
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48.502
IT'S NOT CONTAMINATED.

58
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:51.539
IT'S JUST TAP WATER.
POUR IT IN HIS BOWL.

59
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53.841
- IT TASTES FUNNY.
- IT DOES NOT.

60
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55.843
AND BESIDES,
HE LICKS HIS BUTT EVERY DAY.

61
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57.845
I DON'T THINK HE'LL MIND.

62
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14.728
[barks, growls]

63
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16.697
HOUDINI?

64
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19.700
BO, DON'T RUN.

65
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21.835
WHAT'S WRONG, BOY?

66
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23.837
STOP IT, HOUDINI.

67
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:29.577
[barks, growling]

68
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34.882
- LOOK AT WHERE IT'S BENT OVER,
FATHER.

69
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37.685
- IT'S NOT BROKEN.

70
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40.187
- NOW, WHAT KIND OF MACHINE
CAN BEND A STALK OF CORN OVER

71
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42.690
WITHOUT BREAKING IT?

72
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45.693
- CAN'T BE BY HAND.
IT'S TOO PERFECT.

73
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47.861
- IT DOESN'T SOUND MUCH
LIKE LIONEL PRICHARD

74
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48.862
AND THE WOLFINGTON BROTHERS.

75
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50.530
THEY CAN'T TAKE A PISS

76
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53.567
WITHOUT WETTING
THE FRONT OF THEIR PANTS.

77
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57.871
I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE AROUND
HERE HAS HAD ANY PROBLEMS.

78
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00.540
I WAS OVER AT THEO HENRY'S FARM
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,

79
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01.909
AND HE WOULD HAVE MENTIONED
SOMETHING.

80
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04.845
- WHY WERE YOU AT THEO'S PLACE?

81
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07.881
- SOME ANIMALS AROUND THE COUNTY
HAVE BEEN ACTING FUNNY...

82
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:11.719
AND SOME OF THEM VIOLENT.

83
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13.887
- WHAT IS IT, A VIRUS?

84
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16.556
- I DON'T THINK SO, FATHER.

85
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20.460
THEY'RE MORE EDGY.
YOU KNOW, ON ALERT.

86
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23.597
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY ACT WHEN
THEY SMELL A PREDATOR AROUND--

87
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25.933
PEEING ON THEMSELVES
AND EVERYTHING.

88
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37.711
- CAROLINE...

89
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41.481
PLEASE STOP CALLING ME
"FATHER."

90
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43.651
- WHAT'S WRONG?

91
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46.654
- I DON'T HEAR MY CHILDREN.

92
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15.749
[sniffling]

93
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17.751
- HE FELL ON ME.

94
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20.620
HE WANTED TO KILL BO.

95
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31.564
[exhales]

96
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39.973
- DID HE HURT YOU?
- NO.

97
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48.015
- I'M SO SORRY, MORGAN.

98
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10.704
- WHERE WERE YOU?

99
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12.706
- HOUDINI'S SICK.

100
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14.875
- TIE ISABELLE UP TO THE BACK
OF THE SHED, PLEASE,

101
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17.444
AND MAKE SURE THE KNOT'S
VERY TIGHT.

102
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03.757
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

103
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05.959
- THERE'S A MONSTER
OUTSIDE MY ROOM.

104
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:10.030
CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF WATER?

105
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12.599
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WATER
NEXT TO YOUR BED?

106
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15.769
- IT TASTES OLD.

107
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50.537
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

108
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:57.677
- WHY DO YOU TALK TO MOM
WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF?

109
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02.782
- MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

110
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06.786
- DOES SHE EVER ANSWER BACK?

111
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11.658
- NO.

112
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17.064
- SHE NEVER ANSWERS ME EITHER.

113
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34.948
- WHAT?

114
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:39.686
- LIONEL PRICHARD AND THE
WOLFINGTON BROTHERS ARE BACK.

115
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41.521
- IT'S TIME FOR AN ASS-WHUPPING.

116
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44.958
- THIS IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT WAY
TO APPROACH THIS.

117
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47.961
LEE IS A FRIEND OF MINE.
THIS IS HIS SON.

118
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49.662
- YEAH, WE'LL BE DOING LEE
A FAVOR.

119
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52.132
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
WE BOTH GO OUTSIDE,

120
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54.167
MOVE AROUND THE HOUSE
IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

121
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56.536
WE ACT CRAZY,
INSANE WITH ANGER,

122
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58.038
MAKE THEM CRAP IN THEIR PANTS,

123
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01.008
FORCE THEM AROUND TILL
WE MEET UP ON THE OTHER SIDE.

124
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02.910
- EXPLAIN "ACT CRAZY."

125
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04.844
- YOU KNOW, CURSE AND STUFF.

126
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06.914
- YOU WANT ME TO CURSE?
- YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

127
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09.082
IT'S JUST FOR SHOW.
WHAT?

128
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10.984
- WELL, IT WON'T BE CONVINCING.

129
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13.086
IT DOESN'T SOUND NATURAL
WHEN I CURSE.

130
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16.156
- JUST MAKE NOISES, THEN.

131
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17.925
- EXPLAIN "NOISES."

132
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20.693
- ARE YOU GONNA DO THIS OR WHAT?
- NO, I'M NOT.

133
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22.162
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT THEM
STEALING SOMETHING

134
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24.697
IN THE HOUSE NEXT TIME?

135
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26.166
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

136
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27.767
1...
- ALL RIGHT.

137
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29.602
- 2...3!

138
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34.041
- AAH!
I'M INSANE WITH ANGER!

139
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36.609
- WE'RE GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS,
BITCH!

140
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41.681
[garbage cans clattering]

141
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43.850
WE'RE GONNA TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF!

142
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46.053
- I'M LOSING MY MIND!

143
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49.756
IT'S TIME FOR
AN ASS-WHUPPING!

144
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59.066
I CURSED.
- I HEARD.

145
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05.072
HOW DID HE GET...

146
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22.422
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS LIONEL PRICHARD?

147
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23.856
[thud]

148
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42.775
- YOU LIKE THAT?

149
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48.781
YOU GOT AN OLD
BABY MONITOR AROUND?

150
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51.018
- BO HAD AN OLD BABY MONITOR.

151
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53.920
- YOU CAN USE BO'S BABY MONITOR
AS A WALKIE-TALKIE.

152
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56.089
- YOU CAN?
- MM-HMM.

153
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:00.793
IT ONLY WORKS ONE WAY,
BUT THAT'LL DO FINE.

154
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02.962
THAT IS, UNTIL SOMEONE
GETS YOU AN OLD WALKIE-TALKIE

155
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04.464
LEFT OVER AT THE STATION.

156
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05.932
- STOP, STOP!
IT'S HIDEOUS!

157
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07.800
- GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF!

158
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09.936
- I-I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

159
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11.971
- HEY, BO...

160
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14.107
TURN THAT DOWN
TILL OFFICER PASKI LEAVES.

161
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15.475
- DOY-DA!

162
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20.813
- YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO STILL BE DOING THIS.

163
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22.815
YOU TAKE A GLASS OF WATER,
AND YOU FINISH IT.

164
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24.717
NOW,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS ONE?

165
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26.786
- IT HAS DUST IN IT.

166
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29.989
- THIS ONE?
- A HAIR.

167
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31.691
- THIS ONE?

168
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34.961
- MORGAN TOOK A SIP,
AND IT HAS HIS AMEBAS IN IT.

169
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36.896
- MY TURN.

170
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41.834
- SO HOW ARE YOU, MERRILL?

171
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45.472
- FINE.

172
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48.908
- HOW IS WORK
AT THE GAS STATION?

173
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51.044
- STIMULATING.

174
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56.015
- I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO TELL YOU,

175
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01.088
BUT I-I THOUGHT YOUR MOVING IN
HERE WITH YOUR BROTHER AFTER--

176
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03.690
IT WAS A NICE THING TO DO.

177
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06.759
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
I'M HELPING MUCH.

178
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12.399
- YOU ARE.

179
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32.885
- SORRY.

180
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37.090
- OKAY, SO FAR I HAVE,
"IT WAS VERY DARK."

181
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39.859
- YES, IT WAS.

182
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43.863
- YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE HIM
AT ALL?

183
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46.466
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S KIND OF ODD?

184
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49.802
- A LITTLE.

185
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:53.540
- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO LOOK
FOR A GIANT OR A MIDGET.

186
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55.742
- NO, HE DEFINITELY
WASN'T A MIDGET.

187
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57.544
- OKAY.

188
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01.414
SO HE WAS TALL?

189
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04.751
- I-I WOULD SAY SO, YES.

190
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06.419
- PROBABLY.

191
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08.588
- OVER 6 FEET?

192
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:14.494
- IT WAS VERY DARK.
- YES, IT WAS.

193
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16.963
- HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU
THAT THIS WAS A MALE?

194
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18.765
- OH, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW ANY GIRLS

195
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20.567
WHO COULD RUN LIKE THAT.

196
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22.101
- I DON'T KNOW, MERRILL.

197
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24.571
I'VE SEEN SOME OF THOSE WOMEN
ON THE OLYMPICS.

198
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26.939
THEY CAN RUN LIKE THE WIND.

199
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29.909
- THIS GUY GOT ON OUR ROOF IN,
LIKE, A SECOND.

200
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31.944
O-OUR ROOF IS 10 FEET HIGH.

201
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34.814
- THEY HAVE WOMEN'S HIGH JUMPING
IN THE OLYMPICS.

202
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36.583
THEY GOT THESE
SCANDINAVIAN WOMEN

203
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39.386
WHO CAN JUMP CLEAN OVER ME.

204
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45.925
- CAROLINE, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAKING A POINT HERE.

205
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47.794
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

206
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49.429
- AN OUT-OF-TOWN WOMAN

207
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51.798
STOPPED BY THE DINER
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

208
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53.533
AND STARTED YELLING AND CUSSING

209
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55.502
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
HER FAVORITE CIGARETTES

210
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57.804
AT THE VENDING MACHINE.

211
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:02.509
AND SHE SCARED
A COUPLE OF THE CUSTOMERS.

212
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05.612
NO ONE'S SEEN HER SINCE.

213
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07.480
AND MY POINT IS,

214
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09.882
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PERSON YOU SAW,

215
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:14.554
AND WE SHOULD JUST KEEP
ALL POSSIBILITIES AVAILABLE.

216
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19.826
- DAD, WHERE'S THE REMOTE?
- I DON'T KNOW, BABY.

217
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23.062
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK
IN THE SOFA CUSHIONS?

218
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25.398
- EXCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY

219
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27.967
THAT A FEMALE
SCANDINAVIAN OLYMPIAN

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30.002
WAS RUNNING AROUND OUTSIDE
OUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT,

221
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32.539
WHAT ELSE
MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY?

222
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34.974
- I'M NOT DONE ASKING QUESTIONS,

223
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37.544
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE SARCASM.

224
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40.913
DO YOU TWO HAVE ANYONE

225
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44.150
WHO MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE
OR SOMETHING AGAINST YOU...

226
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48.020
MAYBE A-A CHURCH MEMBER WHO--

227
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51.023
WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE LIKED THE
FACT THAT YOU LEFT THE CHURCH?

228
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55.528
- I DON'T THINK SO.

229
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57.096
- OKAY, I WAS OUT OF LINE

230
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59.566
WITH THE WHOLE "FEMALE
SCANDINAVIAN OLYMPIAN" THING.

231
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03.002
IT'S JUST...I'M PRETTY STRONG,

232
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05.538
AND I'M PRETTY FAST.

233
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07.440
AND I WAS RUNNING
AS FAST AS I COULD,

234
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10.042
AND THIS GUY, HE WAS...

235
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13.179
HE WAS JUST TOYING WITH US.

236
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16.949
- THERE'S ONLY FOOD
UNDER THE SOFA.

237
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18.851
- BABY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CHANGE THE CHANNEL

238
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19.852
ON THE TELEVISION?

239
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22.188
- I DID.
- AND?

240
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26.393
- SAME SHOW'S ON EVERY STATION.

241
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30.129
- EVERY STATION?

242
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37.470
BO, TURN UP THE VOLUME.

243
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41.408
- CROP SIGNS FIRST EMERGED
IN THE LATE '70s

244
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44.477
WITH RENEWED INTEREST
IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE.

245
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:49.582
THEY DIED OUT BY THE EARLY '80s,
DISMISSED AS HOAXES.

246
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52.919
THIS NEW RESURGENCE
IS WHOLLY DIFFERENT.

247
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55.555
THE SPEED AND THE QUANTITY
IN WHICH IT HAS APPEARED

248
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58.491
IMPLIES THE COORDINATION
OF HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS

249
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00.660
OVER MANY COUNTRIES.

250
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07.634
THERE ARE ONLY A LIMITED
NUMBER OF EXPLANATIONS.

251
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:12.004
EITHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
ELABORATE HOAXES EVER CREATED,

252
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16.008
OR BASICALLY...

253
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18.678
IT'S FOR REAL.

254
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27.987
- EXTRATERRESTRIALS.

255
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32.525
- WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS GOING ON?

256
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36.429
I DID SOME RESEARCH
AFTER I SAW YOUR CROPS.

257
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38.030
TWO OR THREE GUYS
CAN MAKE A DESIGN

258
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40.032
THE SIZE OF THE ONE
IN YOUR FIELD OVERNIGHT

259
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41.934
USING JUST BOARDS AND ROPES.

260
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43.670
- REALLY.

261
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:47.039
- WELL, THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS
HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.

262
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50.477
BUT THERE'S SO MANY NOW.

263
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53.480
HOW COULD SO MANY PEOPLE
BE IN ON IT?

264
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58.050
I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

265
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59.652
I'M--I'M GONNA
GO BACK TO THE STATION

266
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01.521
AND HAVE A CUP OF EDGAR'S COFFEE

267
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04.457
AND--AND TRY TO THINK CLEAR,
AND AFTER THAT, I'LL...

268
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06.693
I MIGHT MAKE SOME CALLS.

269
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08.160
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--

270
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10.162
WHAT I SAID IN THERE,
IT STILL GOES.

271
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12.732
YOUR--YOUR FAMILY
HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

272
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15.167
AND THE LAST THING
THESE CHILDREN NEED TO DO

273
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18.971
IS WORRY ABOUT SOME CRAZY THINGS
HAPPENING IN THE WORLD.

274
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20.673
NOW, TAKE THEM INTO TOWN

275
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:24.544
AND GET THEIR MINDS AND YOUR
MIND ON EVERYDAY THINGS, HMM?

276
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26.579
GOOD MEDICINE.

277
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29.716
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

278
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34.754
- AND YOU TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF...

279
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37.557
GRAHAM.

280
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50.770
- THE FOOTAGE YOU'RE WATCHING
WAS SHOT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

281
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53.506
BY A 34-YEAR-OLD
LOCAL CAMERAMAN IN BANGALORE,

282
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56.075
A SOUTHERN CITY OF INDIA.

283
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59.412
IT'S THE 18TH REPORTED CROP SIGN
FOUND IN THAT COUNTRY

284
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01.781
IN THE LAST 72 HOURS.

285
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06.753
- UNCLE MERRILL,
WILL YOU TURN ON THE RADIO?

286
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12.425
- THEY ARE SIGNS INTENDED TO BE
SEEN FROM THE SKY--

287
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17.730
- NO RADIO EITHER.
JUST FOR A WHILE.

288
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47.760
- BOOK MONEY?

289
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:48.828
- SURE.

290
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51.397
[paper rustling]

291
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53.032
JUST ONE.

292
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:05.645
BE BACK FOR PIZZA IN 15.

293
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:12.619
- IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF CROCK.

294
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:16.489
THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL SODAS.
IT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

295
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18.357
BEEN WATCHING THESE REPORTS
SINCE MORNING.

296
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23.362
I HAVE SEEN 12 SODA COMMERCIALS
SO FAR--12!

297
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26.365
- YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS
ON EXTRATERRESTRIALS?

298
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29.035
- NOW, DON'T TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
THIS HORSE MANURE.

299
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31.504
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I THINK WE HAVE ONE.

300
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33.506
CAME BY MISTAKE IN A SHIPMENT--

301
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35.775
DECIDED TO KEEP IT
FOR THE CITY PEOPLE.

302
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39.612
LAST ROW, THIRD BOOK
ON THE LEFT, HONEY.

303
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41.714
- WHY IS NO ONE SAYING
THE OBVIOUS?

304
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44.450
THESE ARE JUST COPYCATS.

305
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47.486
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE
DOES THE FIRST ONE...

306
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49.856
- IT WAS ASTHMA MEDICINE,
RIGHT, FATHER?

307
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51.858
- FOR MORGAN HESS.

308
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54.694
AND IT'S NOT "FATHER" ANYMORE.

309
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56.395
- IN LESS THAN AN HOUR,

310
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58.497
A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE
GET THE SAME BRILLIANT IDEA,

311
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02.569
AND HERE WE ARE,
ON THE VERGE OF MASS HYSTERIA.

312
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10.643
- CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR,
FATHER?

313
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12.845
I NEED TO CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE.

314
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15.648
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?

315
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17.483
- TRACEY...

316
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20.086
I AM NOT A REVEREND ANYMORE.

317
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22.855
I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR SIX MONTHS.

318
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25.424
YOU KNOW THIS.

319
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28.394
- ALL THIS STUFF ON TV--

320
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30.730
JOE GILLS CAME IN HERE TALKING
ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD--

321
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33.900
I'M JUST A LITTLE SCARED.
[sniffles]

322
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:37.937
PLEASE, I NEED TO CLEAR
MY CONSCIENCE.

323
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48.915
- I'VE GOT IT FIGURED.

324
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52.685
- YOU DO?

325
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54.520
- I'VE HAD TWO SEPARATE FOLKS
TELL ME

326
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57.690
THERE HAVE BEEN STRANGERS AROUND
THESE PARTS LAST COUPLE NIGHTS.

327
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59.558
CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE

328
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:03.562
'CAUSE THEY'RE STAYING
IN THE SHADOWS--COVERT-LIKE.

329
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:07.700
NOBODY'S BEEN HURT, MIND YOU,
AND THAT'S THE GIVEAWAY.

330
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11.437
- I SEE.
- IT'S CALLED "PROBING."

331
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13.405
IT'S A MILITARY PROCEDURE.

332
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15.708
YOU SEND OUT A RECONNAISSANCE
GROUP, VERY SMALL,

333
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17.710
CHECK THINGS OUT.

334
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:21.748
NOT TO ENGAGE BUT TO EVALUATE
THE SITUATION...

335
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:24.784
EVALUATE THE LEVEL OF DANGER,

336
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27.586
MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ALL CLEAR.

337
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31.157
- CLEAR FOR WHAT?

338
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34.360
- FOR THE REST OF THEM.

339
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:38.931
- YEAH?

340
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:42.568
YOU GOT A PAMPHLET OR SOMETHING
I CAN READ?

341
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45.504
- SURE.

342
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47.774
- THANKS.

343
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:51.978
- YOU DIDN'T USED TO PLAY
BASEBALL, DID YA?

344
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55.782
SHIT, I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE MERRILL HESS.

345
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57.984
I WAS THERE THE DAY YOU HIT
THAT 507-FOOTER

346
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00.987
OVER THE LEFT-FIELD WALL,
SET THE RECORD.

347
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03.622
MAN, THAT THING
HAD A MOTOR ON IT.

348
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06.793
IT'S STILL THE RECORD, RIGHT?

349
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:09.996
- GOT THE BAT AT HOME
O-ON THE WALL.

350
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12.932
- YOU'VE GOT TWO MINOR-LEAGUE
HOME-RUN RECORDS, DON'T YA?

351
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15.634
- [softly] FIVE.

352
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17.770
- WHY AREN'T YOU IN THE PROS
MAKING STACKS OF CASH

353
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20.506
AND GETTING YOUR TOES LICKED
BY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN?

354
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23.976
- 'CAUSE HE HAS ANOTHER RECORD
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

355
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27.714
HE HAS THE MINOR-LEAGUE
STRIKEOUT RECORD.

356
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31.017
- HELLO, LIONEL.

357
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34.386
- MERRILL'S A CLASS-A
SCREW-UP.

358
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37.023
HE WOULD JUST SWING THAT BAT
AS HARD AS HE COULD EVERY TIME.

359
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38.791
DIDN'T MATTER
WHAT THE COACHES SAID,

360
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40.659
DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS ON BASE.

361
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42.028
HE WOULD JUST WHIP THAT BAT
THROUGH THE AIR

362
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43.696
AS HARD AS HE COULD.

363
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46.532
LOOKED LIKE A LUMBERJACK
CHOPPING DOWN A TREE.

364
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:50.737
MERRILL HERE HAS MORE STRIKEOUTS
THAN ANY TWO PLAYERS.

365
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53.873
- YOU REALLY GOT
THE STRIKEOUT RECORD?

366
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03.750
- FELT WRONG NOT TO SWING.

367
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18.030
- IT'S CONTAMINATED.

368
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20.900
- CARL, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH OUR WATER.

369
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23.035
- YOUR WATER'S FINE.

370
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26.038
BO HAS THIS THING
ABOUT HER DRINKING WATER.

371
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28.007
SHE HAD IT HER WHOLE LIFE.

372
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31.010
IT'S LIKE A TICK PEOPLE HAVE,
EXCEPT IT'S NOT A TICK.

373
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34.013
- IS THAT RIGHT?

374
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36.682
- [man shouts] 13!

375
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38.751
- * DON'T GIVE ME
THAT SO-SO SODA *

376
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:41.020
* THE SAME OLD COLA

377
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43.856
* I WANT A POW POW 
- I'LL TAKE IT.

378
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47.726
- I CURSED 37 TIMES LAST WEEK.

379
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49.461
I SAID THE "F" WORD
A COUPLE TIMES,

380
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52.865
BUT MOSTLY...[whispers] "SHITS"

381
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55.802
AND...[whispers] "BASTARDS."

382
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57.703
[Muzak playing in background]

383
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00.072
IS "DOUCHE BAG" A CURSE?

384
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03.742
- I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD DEPEND
ON ITS USAGE.

385
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06.745
- HOW ABOUT, "JOHN, YOU'RE A
DOUCHE BAG FOR KISSING BARBARA"?

386
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08.815
- IT'S A CURSE.

387
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:12.684
- THEN IT'S NOT 37.
IT'S 71.

388
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18.825
- PHARMACY CROWDED?

389
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20.726
- I DON'T WANT ANY ONE OF YOU

390
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23.662
SPENDING TIME WITH TRACEY
ABERNATHY ALONE.

391
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26.632
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

392
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46.152
- IS THAT HIM?

393
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53.692
- YEAH.

394
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17.850
- WHO IS HE?

395
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:20.052
[tires squealing]

396
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:48.714
[static buzzing]

397
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52.751
- WHAT IS IT?

398
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55.087
- IT'S BO'S BABY MONITOR.

399
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57.023
- I FOUND IT IN THE BASEMENT.

400
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59.691
I'M GONNA USE IT
AS A WALKIE-TALKIE.

401
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05.064
[humming, droning]

402
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08.100
WHAT IF IT'S CATCHING
A SIGNAL FROM THEM?

403
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13.940
- IT'S NOT.
- BUT IT WASN'T WORKING.

404
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16.875
- MORGAN, THIS CROP STUFF
IS ABOUT A BUNCH OF NERDS

405
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18.844
WHO NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND
IN THEIR LIVES.

406
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21.580
THEY'RE, LIKE, 30, AND THEY WORK
UP LITTLE CODES TOGETHER,

407
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24.583
AND THEY ANALYZE GREEK MYTHOLOGY
AND MAKE UP SECRET SOCIETIES

408
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27.119
WHERE OTHER GUYS WHO NEVER HAD
GIRLFRIENDS BEFORE CAN JOIN IN.

409
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29.922
THEY DO STUPID CRAP
LIKE THIS TO FEEL SPECIAL.

410
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31.690
IT'S A SCAM.

411
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32.959
NERDS WERE DOING IT
25 YEARS AGO,

412
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35.794
AND NEW NERDS
ARE DOING IT AGAIN.

413
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41.600
- IT'S JUST STATIC, MORGAN,
ALL RIGHT?

414
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43.702
TURN IT UP.
SEE.

415
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47.606
[whining, eerie droning]

416
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48.975
- IT'S A CODE.

417
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51.610
- WHY CAN'T
THEY GET GIRLFRIENDS?

418
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54.947
- CAN I SEE THAT, PLEASE?

419
00:31:56,115 --> 00:32:00.119
[static whining, droning]

420
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01.887
[fades away]

421
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04.423
- IT'S NOISE.

422
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06.993
- IT'S BROKEN, MORGAN.
IT'S JUST GONNA KEEP DOING THIS.

423
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08.660
MAYBE SOME NEW BATTERIES...

424
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10.629
- WE MIGHT LOSE THE SIGNAL.

425
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13.365
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE NERDS WANT.

426
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18.104
- I'M GETTING OUT NOW.

427
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:23.809
[louder droning,
eerie sounds]

428
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25.844
- NOBODY MOVE.

429
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:31.817
VOICES.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

430
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33.752
NOT ENGLISH, THOUGH.

431
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35.687
YOU HEARD THE VOICES, RIGHT,
UNCLE MERRILL?

432
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40.926
- I HEARD THEM, MORGAN.

433
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45.464
[clicking sound
under droning]

434
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:49.035
- PROBABLY PICKING UP
ANOTHER BABY MONITOR.

435
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51.370
- THAT'S RIGHT.

436
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:55.474
[soft clicking, popping]

437
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00.846
- LET ME SEE IT.

438
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04.483
[sounds increase]
- STOP!

439
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12.391
[clicking, popping continues
under eerie droning]

440
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15.861
- SEE, THIS IS WHY
WE'RE NOT WATCHING TV.

441
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17.829
PEOPLE GET OBSESSED.

442
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19.498
I'M LETTING GO NOW.

443
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21.500
- NO, DAD!
- DON'T DO IT!

444
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23.369
- YOU'LL LOSE THE SIGNAL.

445
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:28.674
- DON'T LET GO.

446
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31.710
IT GETS CLEARER
THE HIGHER YOU HOLD IT.

447
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37.783
- I GOT HIM.

448
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:43.021
- BO, HONEY, I DON'T WANT YOU
CLIMBING ON THE CAR.

449
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58.003
- STOP!

450
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00.506
[clicking, popping sounds,
eerie droning]

451
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02.941
THERE'S TWO OF THEM TALKING.

ISABELLE, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
VERY SILLY

460
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19.551
WHEN THIS TURNS OUT
TO BE ALL JUST MAKE-BELIEVE.

YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE!

I'M NOT GONNA REPORT THIS
OR ANYTHING YOU DO TO MY CROPS

466
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:09.561
TO THE NEWS OR TV OR ANYBODY.

00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25.597
OKAY.

HAVE CONFIRMED
THAT THESE ARE NOT AIRCRAFT

FROM EITHER GOVERNMENT'S
AIR FORCE.

EN ROUTE
FROM MAZATLAN TO NEW YORK.

00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59.531
THEY WERE NOT DETECTED BY RADAR
BY EITHER COUNTRY.

- LISTEN, BO,
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

EVERYTHING PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN
ABOUT IN SCIENCE BOOKS

491

- FIND ANOTHER TAPE.

501
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37.869
- UNCLE MERRILL,
I'M USING YOUR TAPE.

502
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45.076
- YOU ARE SEEING A LIVE FEED
FROM OUR AFFILIATE

IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

EVERYTHING THEY WROTE
IN SCIENCE BOOKS

508
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59.424
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

509
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02.160

510
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05.130
[inhales deeply]

511
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19.110
- SOME PEOPLE
ARE PROBABLY THINKING

512
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21.446
THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD.

513
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23.849
- THAT'S TRUE.

514
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26.718
- DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE?

515
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:29.555
- YES.

516
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31.890
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

517
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36.528
- THAT WASN'T
THE ANSWER YOU WANTED?

518
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42.568
- COULDN'T YOU PRETEND
TO BE LIKE YOU USED TO BE...

519
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:47.072
[chuckles]
GIVE ME SOME COMFORT?

520
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:50.141
- PEOPLE...

521
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:53.144
BREAK DOWN INTO TWO GROUPS.

522
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55.847
WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE
SOMETHING LUCKY,

523
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58.483
GROUP NUMBER ONE

524
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01.720
SEES IT AS MORE THAN LUCK,
MORE THAN COINCIDENCE.

525
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04.856
THEY SEE IT AS A SIGN...

526
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08.159
EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS
SOMEONE UP THERE

527
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10.862
WATCHING OUT FOR THEM.

528
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12.598
GROUP NUMBER TWO

529
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:17.736
SEES IT AS JUST PURE LUCK,
A HAPPY TURN OF CHANCE.

530
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19.738
I'M SURE THE PEOPLE
IN GROUP NUMBER TWO

531
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23.508
ARE LOOKING AT THOSE 14 LIGHTS
IN A VERY SUSPICIOUS WAY.

532
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27.613
FOR THEM,
THE SITUATION ISN'T 50-50.

533
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29.615
IT COULD BE BAD.

534
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31.750
IT COULD BE GOOD.

535
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34.519
BUT DEEP DOWN...

536
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37.623
THEY FEEL
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS,

537
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:39.758
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN.

538
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:44.763
AND THAT FILLS THEM WITH FEAR.

539
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:48.900
YEAH, THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE.

540
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50.769
BUT THERE'S
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE

541
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53.772
IN THE GROUP NUMBER ONE.

542
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57.208
WHEN THEY SEE THOSE 14 LIGHTS,

543
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00.646
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A MIRACLE.

544
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:05.483
AND DEEP DOWN, THEY FEEL
THAT WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

545
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:09.788
THERE'LL BE SOMEONE THERE
TO HELP THEM.

546
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:13.491
AND THAT FILLS THEM WITH HOPE.

547
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14.926
SEE, WHAT YOU HAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF IS,

548
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17.663
WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?

549
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19.931
ARE YOU THE KIND
THAT SEES SIGNS,

550
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22.801
SEES MIRACLES?

551
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:26.672
OR DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE JUST GET LUCKY?

552
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:30.676
OR LOOK
AT THE QUESTION THIS WAY--

553
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:35.847
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE
ARE NO COINCIDENCES?

554
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:45.523
- I WAS AT THIS PARTY ONCE.

555
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48.827
I'M ON THE COUCH
WITH RANDA MCKINNEY.

556
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51.429
[exhales sharply]
SHE WAS JUST SITTING THERE,

557
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55.533
LOOKING BEAUTIFUL,
STARING AT ME.

558
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57.669
I GO TO LEAN IN AND KISS HER...

559
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:02.507
[laughing] AND I REALIZE
I HAVE GUM IN MY MOUTH.

560
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05.977
SO I TURN, TAKE OUT THE GUM,

561
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:09.447
STUFF IT IN A PAPER CUP
NEXT TO THE SOFA,

562
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11.449
AND TURN AROUND.

563
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14.853
RANDA MCKINNEY THROWS UP
ALL OVER HERSELF.

564
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17.455
[chuckles]

565
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21.693
I KNEW THE SECOND IT HAPPENED,
IT WAS A MIRACLE.

566
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:25.463
I COULD'VE BEEN KISSING HER
WHEN SHE THREW UP.

567
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28.700
THAT WOULD'VE SCARRED ME
FOR LIFE.

568
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:32.570
I MAY NEVER HAVE RECOVERED.

569
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34.572
[laughing]

570
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37.709
I'M A MIRACLE MAN.

571
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:41.479
THOSE LIGHTS ARE A MIRACLE.

572
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44.015
- THERE YOU GO.

573
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:48.854
- SO WHICH TYPE ARE YOU?

574
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:53.591
- DO YOU FEEL COMFORTED?

575
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56.661
- YEAH, I DO.

576
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59.564
- THEN WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

577
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:09.007
I NEVER TOLD YOU THE LAST WORDS
THAT COLLEEN SAID

578
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12.643
BEFORE THEY LET HER DIE.

579
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18.784
SHE SAID, "SEE."

580
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24.522
THEN HER EYES GLAZED A BIT.

581
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27.793
AND THEN SHE SAID,
"SWING AWAY."

582
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31.797
YOU KNOW WHY SHE SAID THAT?

583
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:37.769
'CAUSE THE NERVE ENDINGS IN HER
BRAIN WERE FIRING AS SHE DIED,

584
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:40.638
AND SOME RANDOM MEMORY OF US
AT ONE OF YOUR BASEBALL GAMES

585
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43.674
JUST POPPED INTO HER HEAD.

586
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52.683
THERE IS NO ONE WATCHING OUT
FOR US, MERRILL.

587
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57.088
WE ARE ALL ON OUR OWN.

588
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:14.539
[sirens wailing]

589
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37.996
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

590
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39.831
- WELL, THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT,
DRUNK DRIVING.

591
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41.532
THEY WEREN'T SURE--
- HE WASN'T DRUNK.

592
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:42.667
RAY FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL.

593
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44.970
- IS HE OKAY?
- YEAH.

594
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:48.506
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
COLLEEN ASKED TOO.

595
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50.708
- SHE'S TALKING.
WHAT AMBULANCE IS SHE IN?

596
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53.144
- SHE'S NOT
IN AN AMBULANCE, FATHER.

597
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38.856
[television humming
and whirring]

598
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40.858
- FOR THE KIDS' PROTECTION.

599
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42.860
ALL THEY WERE DOING
WAS WATCHING TV FROM 5:00 A.M.

600
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44.862
I FELT LIKE THEY WERE GETTING
OBSESSED, LIKE YOU SAID.

601
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46.564
THEY SHOULD BE PLAYING
FURRY, FURRY RABBIT

602
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48.166
OR TEA PARTY OR SOMETHING.

603
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50.868
- WHAT'S FURRY, FURRY RABBIT?
- IT'S A GAME, ISN'T IT?

604
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53.004
ANYWAYS,
THEY CLOSED THE SCHOOLS.

605
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55.740
AND THERE'S BEEN
SOME INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS.

606
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:58.176
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
- 11:00 A.M.

607
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00.011
THEY'RE GONE...

608
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:02.013
BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY GONE.

609
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03.949
WE JUST CAN'T SEE THEM.

610
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06.617
EARLY THIS MORNING,
A BIRD FLEW INTO THE AREA

611
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08.019
WHERE THE LIGHTS
WERE HOVERING LAST NIGHT.

612
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10.855
IT STOPPED DEAD IN THE AIR
AND FELL STRAIGHT DOWN.

613
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12.090
THEY CAUGHT IT ON TAPE.

614
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13.925
THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING IT
ALL MORNING.

615
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:16.627
THE FOOTAGE LOOKS LIKE THE BIRD
FLEW INTO A WALL IN THE SKY.

616
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18.129
THEY FOUND THE BIRD.
HIS--HIS HEAD WAS CRUSHED IN.

617
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:20.765
THEY THINK THEY HAVE SOME KIND
OF INVISIBLE-SHIELD THING GOING,

618
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22.700
L-LIKE AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

619
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25.203
THEY'RE STILL THERE...

620
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27.905
HOVERING.

621
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:30.775
SOME PEOPLE THINK
THERE'S MORE OF THEM NOW...

622
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:33.778
ALL OVER THE PLACE,
OVER US, EVEN.

623
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:36.781
THERE'S A THEORY
ABOUT THE CR--CROP CIRCLES.

624
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:40.385
THEY COULD BE SOME KIND OF--

625
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42.787
SOME KIND OF LANDMARK,

626
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44.389
VISUAL MAPPING SYSTEM

627
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:49.060
SO THEY COULD NAVIGATE,
COORDINATE.

628
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51.862
MAKES SENSE.

629
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57.435
[wind chimes clinking]

630
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07.945
[indistinct chatter]

631
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:18.123
- IS IT TRUE?

632
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23.694
- SO THE ALIENS
CAN'T READ OUR MINDS.

633
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26.831
- OH.

634
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:28.399
OH, OF COURSE.

635
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36.841
- THEY TELL YOU EVERYTHING
IN THIS BOOK.

636
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:39.677
IT SAYS THEY'RE PROBABLY
VERY SMALL, LIKE MY HEIGHT,

637
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41.112
BECAUSE
AS THEIR BRAINS DEVELOPED,

638
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:43.981
THERE WAS NO USE
FOR PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.

639
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46.117
IT ALSO SAYS
THEY'RE PROBABLY VEGETARIANS,

640
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:48.953
BECAUSE THEY WOULD'VE REALIZED
THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DIET.

641
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50.788
- WHO WROTE THIS BOOK?

642
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53.491
- SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE BEEN
PERSECUTED FOR THEIR BELIEFS.

643
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55.126
- THAT MEANS
THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED.

644
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57.462
- IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE FUN
OF IT, THEN FORGET IT.

645
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00.365
- THIS IS SERIOUS.

646
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07.004
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

647
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:08.839
- THERE ARE PICTURES.

648
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11.008
DR. BIMBU, ONE OF THE AUTHORS
OF THE BOOK--

649
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12.477
- BIMBU?
- DAD.

650
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14.011
- I JUST ASKED HIS NAME.

651
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:17.014
- YOU HAD A TONE.

652
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18.483
HE SAID THERE ARE TWO REASONS

653
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20.718
WHY EXTRATERRESTRIALS
WOULD VISIT US--

654
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23.154
TO MAKE CONTACT
IN THE SPIRIT OF EXPLORATION

655
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:26.157
AND FURTHERING THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE UNIVERSE,

656
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:27.992
OR THE OTHER REASON--

657
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29.760
THEY'RE HOSTILE.

658
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31.862
THEY'VE USED UP ALL
THE RESOURCES ON THEIR PLANET,

659
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:35.066
AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO HARVEST
OUR PLANET NEXT.

660
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39.370
- HERE.

661
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10.768
LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE OUR HOUSE,
DOESN'T IT?

662
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13.037
- SAME WINDOWS.

663
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15.940
- THAT'S WEIRD.

664
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29.787
[telephone rings]

665
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31.389
- AAH!
- [gasps]

666
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33.057
- YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

667
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36.060
THAT'S ENOUGH
FROM DR. BIMBU FOR NOW.

668
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38.396
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE
NEEDS TO CALM DOWN

669
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40.931
AND EAT SOME FRUIT
OR SOMETHING.

670
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:44.435
[ringing continues]

671
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46.070
HELLO?

672
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48.806
- FATHER?

673
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51.509
- HELLO?

674
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53.077
HELLO?

675
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56.113
[line beeping]

676
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:08.526
[footsteps descending stairs]

677
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15.099
I'M GOING OUT
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

678
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17.101
NO ONE LEAVES THIS HOUSE--
NO ONE.

679
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19.103
- WHERE YOU GOING?

680
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21.439
- RAY REDDY'S HOUSE.

681
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23.541
- WHY?
- I THINK HE JUST CALLED HERE.

682
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:26.544
[door opens, closes]

683
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35.520
- YOU DON'T THINK
SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN,

684
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37.555
DO YOU, MORGAN?

685
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:38.989
- WHY?

686
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:42.026
YOU HAVE ONE
OF YOUR FEELINGS AGAIN?

687
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:46.030
IS IT BAD?

688
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51.569
I WON'T LET ANYTHING BAD
HAPPEN TO YOU.

689
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:55.840
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

690
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:58.509
- WHO SAID I WAS GONNA DIE?

691
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03.548
WHO SAID I WAS GONNA DIE?

692
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07.585
[knocking at door]

693
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14.625
[door creaking]

694
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26.664
- HELLO, RAY.

695
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:45.149
WHAT HAPPENED?

696
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:49.454
- I WROTE YOUR NUMBER DOWN
TO CALL YOU.

697
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55.693
IT'S BEEN SITTING NEXT
TO THE PHONE FOR SIX MONTHS.

698
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00.998
WHEN I KNEW
IT WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE...

699
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04.001
I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANY OTHER NUMBER TO CALL.

700
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06.537
I PANICKED.

701
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:08.973
THANK YOU FOR COMING, FATHER.

702
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11.542
- YOU'RE WELCOME, RAY.

703
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:15.546
- I WORKED SO LONG THAT NIGHT.

704
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18.549
I'VE NEVER FALLEN ASLEEP
DRIVING BEFORE...

705
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20.017
NEVER SINCE.

706
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21.452
- DON'T.

707
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23.554
- MOST OF THE RIDE HOME,

708
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:27.124
THERE WASN'T A CAR IN SIGHT
IN EITHER DIRECTION.

709
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29.694
IF I'D HAVE FALLEN
ASLEEP THEN,

710
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:34.131
I WOULD'VE ENDED UP
IN A DITCH WITH A HEADACHE.

711
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37.702
IT HAD TO BE
AT THAT RIGHT MOMENT--

712
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:41.506
THAT 10, 15 SECONDS
WHEN I PASSED HER WALKING.

713
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:47.378
IT WAS LIKE
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

714
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57.488
I GUESS IF THIS
IS THE END OF THE WORLD,

715
00:55:57,522 --> 00:55:59.724
I'M SCREWED, RIGHT?

716
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02.159
PEOPLE WHO KILL
REVERENDS' WIVES

717
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05.630
AREN'T EXACTLY USHERED TO
THE FRONT OF THE LINE IN HEAVEN.

718
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12.470
[engine turning]
- WH--WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

719
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:17.174
- TO THE LAKE.

720
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20.177
THE WAY I SEE IT...

721
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22.613
THESE PLACES
MARKED IN CROPS AND SUCH--

722
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:26.016
NONE OF THEM
ARE REALLY NEAR WATER.

723
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30.020
I DON'T THINK
THEY LIKE WATER.

724
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33.123
CAN'T BE ANY WORSE THAN HERE.

725
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:37.027
- DID YOU SEE SOMETHING, RAY?

726
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40.531
- I KNOW
WHAT I'VE DONE TO YOU.

727
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:43.067
I MADE YOU QUESTION
YOUR FAITH.

728
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49.674
I'M TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT
I'VE DONE TO YOU AND YOURS.

729
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59.484
- [breathes deeply]

730
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:01.085
ALL RIGHT.

731
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05.790
- AND DON'T OPEN
MY PANTRY, FATHER.

732
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:08.358
I FOUND ONE OF THEM IN THERE
AND LOCKED HIM IN.

733
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19.504
- THE STARTLING FOOTAGE
WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU

734
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21.506
WAS PHOTOGRAPHED
BY A 42-YEAR-OLD,

735
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22.807
ROMERO VALADAREZ.

736
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24.809
THIS VIDEO
WAS TAKEN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

737
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26.511
AT HIS SON'S 7TH BIRTHDAY

738
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28.679
IN THE CITY
OF PASSO FUNDO, BRAZIL.

739
00:57:28,713 --> 00:57:30.815
IT WAS SENT
TO THE LOCAL NEWS BUREAU THERE

740
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:33.818
AND SENT TO US VIA SATELLITE
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

741
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:37.421
ALL INITIAL OPINIONS
ARE THIS IS GENUINE.

742
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40.625
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
MAY DISTURB YOU.

743
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:43.661
[children shouting
in Portuguese]

744
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10.555
- MOVE, CHILDREN!

745
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:11.789
 VAMONOS! 

746
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:15.459
- [speaking Portuguese]

747
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17.728
IT'S BEHIND!

748
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22.867
[screaming]

749
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24.869
- OH!

750
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:33.110
[screaming continues]

751
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40.484
- [speaking Portuguese]

752
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42.887
IT'S BEHIND!

753
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25.395
- HELLO?

754
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36.540
THE POLICE ARE HERE.
I'M WITH THEM.

755
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38.943
I AM A POLICE OFFICER.

756
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:43.914
I JUST WANT TO TALK WITH YOU.

757
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:48.485
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE HOAX.

758
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50.487
WE ALREADY TOOK
SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS DOWNTOWN

759
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52.556
IN A PADDY WAGON.

760
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54.759
[mouths words]

761
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00.497
JUST TELL US YOUR NAME
AND WHY YOU DID IT,

762
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:04.501
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU THE SAME DEAL
WE GAVE THE OTHERS.

763
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07.705
DON'T THROW
YOUR LIFE AWAY, SON.

764
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:41.698
[gasps, grunting]

765
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:45.770
- AAH!
- AAH!

766
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02.652
[door locks]

767
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22.773
- THEIR SKIN CHANGES COLORS.

768
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25.575
THAT'S WHY WE COULDN'T SEE THEM
THAT NIGHT.

769
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29.780
- TELL ME SOMETHING,
MORGAN, UH...

770
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32.917
IN THIS BOOK OF YOURS...

771
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34.651
DID THEY HAPPEN TO DETAIL

772
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37.822
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THEY WERE HOSTILE?

773
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:39.790
- YES.

774
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:42.927
IT SAID
THEY WOULD PROBABLY INVADE.

775
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46.630
THEY WOULD USE GROUND TACTICS,
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

776
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:48.498
THEY WOULDN'T USE
THEIR TECHNOLOGY

777
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50.067
OR FIGHT AN AIRBORNE BATTLE,

778
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52.937
'CAUSE THEY KNOW EVENTUALLY
WE WOULD USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

779
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55.806
THEN THE PLANET
WOULD BE USELESS TO THEM.

780
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57.808
- HOW COULD ANYONE POSSIBLY KNOW
THAT INFORMATION?

781
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:59.676
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

782
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01.678
WHAT ELSE DID IT SAY?

783
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04.849
- THEY SAID THERE ARE ONE
OF TWO OUTCOMES OF AN INVASION.

784
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06.951
ONE, THEY FIGHT
AND ARE DEFEATED

785
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:09.653
AND HAVE TO RETURN AGAIN
WITH FULL FORCES

786
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11.989
HUNDREDS MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS
OF YEARS LATER.

787
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:15.659
- WHAT'S TWO?

788
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:18.963
- THEY WIN.

789
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:22.967
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT--WHAT BOOK IS THIS?

790
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25.702
- IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

791
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33.110
I HEARD A THEORY THAT, UH...

792
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35.545
THEY DON'T LIKE PLACES
NEAR WATER.

793
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38.983
MAYBE WE'D BE SAFE FROM THEM
NEAR A LAKE OR SOMETHING, BUT...

794
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:41.818
- SOUNDS MADE UP.

795
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53.898
- I SAW ONE OF THEM
AT RAY REDDY'S HOUSE.

796
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55.832
I CAN'T BE SURE,

797
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:59.036
BUT I GOT THE DISTINCT FEELING
IT WANTED TO HARM ME.

798
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02.839
SO...

799
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04.909
WE CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
THIS LAKE IDEA,

800
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:08.012
PACK UP, AND GO...

801
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10.714
OR WE CAN STAY HERE,

802
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:13.683
HIDE INSIDE OUR HOME,
WAIT IT OUT.

803
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:14.851
WE MIGHT BE OVERREACTING,

804
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:18.588
BUT I'M WILLING TO LIVE
WITH THAT.

805
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21.391
EITHER WAY,
AT LEAST WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

806
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26.730
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF
THE LAKE IDEA, RAISE YOUR HAND.

807
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:35.705
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF HOME,
RAISE YOUR HAND.

808
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42.179
OKAY.

809
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43.780
MY VOTE COUNTS AS TWO.

810
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45.582
- THAT'S BULLSHIT!
YOU'RE CHEATING!

811
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47.017
- MORGAN, CALM DOWN.

812
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49.019
I GET TWO VOTES BECAUSE
I REPRESENT TWO PARENTS HERE.

813
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51.621
- WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YET.

814
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54.758
WE'LL BE SAFE HERE ANYWAY.

815
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:57.027
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HOME.

816
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59.129
THIS IS WHERE
WE LIVED WITH MOM.

817
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:01.966
- THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

818
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04.434
- I CHANGE MY VOTE.

819
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:05.869
- YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR VOTE.

820
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09.206
- ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF HOME,
RAISE YOUR HAND.

821
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11.375
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

822
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:14.945
- YOU LOSE, THREE TO TWO.

823
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:34.398
- WE'RE GOING TO BOARD UP
EVERY WINDOW IN THIS HOUSE.

824
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37.934
- HOW DO WE KNOW BOARDS
WILL DO ANYTHING?

825
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:41.438
- BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO HAVE
TROUBLE WITH PANTRY DOORS.

826
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45.709
[sighs]

827
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00.690
[wind chimes clinking]

828
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49.073
- THE INFORMATION
WE'RE RECEIVING

829
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:51.075
COMES FROM OUR AFFILIATES
ACROSS THE WORLD.

830
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52.842
[hammer pounding]

831
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:54.411
- DAD, UNCLE MERRILL!

832
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01.185
- AMMAN JOINS NAIROBI,
BEIJING, AND JERUSALEM

833
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:04.054
AS THE LATEST TO CONFIRM
THE APPEARANCE OF LIGHTS.

834
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09.859
- THERE ARE LIGHTS
IN OVER 274 CITIES.

835
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:13.763
THEY THINK IT'LL BE 400
WITHIN THE HOUR.

836
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:18.102
THEY'RE APPEARING AT OR
WITHIN ONE MILE OF CROP SIGNS.

837
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:20.404
- THEY WERE FOR NAVIGATION.

838
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:22.906
THEY MADE A MAP.

839
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:25.775
THEY'RE GONNA BE WITHIN
A MILE OF US.

840
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:28.878
- DAD?

841
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:30.714
- YES?

842
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:33.717
- THEY THINK THESE ARE STAGES

843
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37.053
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING
AN ATTACK MANEUVER.

844
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39.523
I WAS WRONG.

845
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41.458
THEY'RE HOSTILE.

846
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47.431
- IT'S LIKE
 WAR OF THE WORLDS. 

847
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49.766
- GROUND FORCES HAVE BEEN
ASSEMBLED IN COUNTRIES

848
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52.102
THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE.

849
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:55.205
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
HAVE FLOCKED

850
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:57.807
TO TEMPLES, SYNAGOGUES,
AND CHURCHES.

851
01:07:57,841 --> 01:08:00.344
[church bell tolling]

852
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06.015
GOD BE WITH US ALL.

853
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:12.522
[military equipment rumbling]

854
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22.031
- I'M GOING TO GET
BACK TO THE WINDOWS.

855
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34.010
- HEY, YOU GUYS OKAY?

856
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:37.814
- SOME GUY HAD A SIGN SAYING IT
WAS THE END OF THE WORLD.

857
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:40.850
- DON'T WORRY.

858
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45.021
- YOU WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN
TO US, RIGHT?

859
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:49.359
- NO WAY.

860
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:51.528
- I WISH YOU WERE MY DAD.

861
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54.964
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

862
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:58.968
DON'T YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING
LIKE THAT AGAIN, EVER.

863
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:22.091
[wind chimes clanging]

864
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:39.476
THERE'S TOO MANY WINDOWS
IN THE BEDROOMS.

865
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41.010
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BOARDS.

866
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:42.846
- WE'LL BOARD UP
THE BEDROOM DOORS.

WHEN YOU WERE BORN, BO?

920
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:14.350
YOU CAME OUT OF YOUR MAMA,
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN CRY.

921
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:15.785
YOU JUST OPENED YOUR EYES,

922
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18.021

AROUND THE ROOM AT EVERYBODY.

THEY PUT YOU ON THE TABLE
TO CLEAN YOU UP,

01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46.716
AND YOU LOOKED UP AT ME,
AND YOU SMILED.

931
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:53.122
THEY SAY BABIES THAT YOUNG
CAN'T SMILE.

932
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54.891
YOU SMILED.

- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU WERE BORN, MORGAN?

953
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:23.673
YOU CAME OUT,
AND YOUR MAMA KEPT BLEEDING,

954
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:25.374
SO THE DOCTORS
RUSHED YOU OUT OF THE ROOM

955
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:26.810

- I WANTED YOUR MAMA
TO SEE YOU FIRST,

963
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:46.796
BECAUSE SHE HAD DREAMED
ABOUT YOU HER WHOLE LIFE.

964
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49.733
AND SHE GOT FEELING BETTER,
THEY BROUGHT YOU IN,

965
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51.868
AND THEY PLACED YOU
IN HER ARMS,

966
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:54.971
AND SHE LOOKED AT YOU,
AND YOU LOOKED AT HER,

967
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:59.008
AND YOU JUST STARED AT
EACH OTHER FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

968
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:03.913

01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:54.423
DON'T BE AFRAID.

1047
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:56.825
THE AIR IS COMING.

1048
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58.827
BELIEVE.

1049
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00.896
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

1050
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03.766
IT'S ABOUT TO PASS.

1051
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:05.801
HERE IT COMES.

1052
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08.003
DON'T BE AFRAID.

1053
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:11.174
HERE COMES THE AIR.

1054
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:13.809
[deep breath]

1055
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:23.519
DON'T BE AFRAID, MORGAN.
FEEL MY CHEST.

1056
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:25.488
BREATHE WITH ME.

1057
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:27.490
TOGETHER.

1058
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:29.825
THE AIR IS GOING IN OUR LUNGS.

1059
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32.461
TOGETHER.

1060
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35.998
WE'RE THE SAME.

1061
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38.133
WE'RE THE SAME.

1062
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:52.648
- WE SHOULD
SAVE THE FLASHLIGHTS.

1063
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01.924
[siren wailing]

1064
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08.063
- RAY'S TRUCK
SWERVED OFF THE ROAD

1065
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:12.401
AND HIT COLLEEN
AND THEN A TREE,

1066
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:15.504
AND SHE WAS PINNED
BETWEEN THE TWO.

1067
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:18.407
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN--PINNED?

1068
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:23.379
- THE TRUCK--THE TRUCK HAS
SEVERED MOST OF HER LOWER HALF.

1069
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:25.548
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1070
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:29.017
- SHE WON'T BE SAVED.

1071
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:31.987
HER BODY IS PINNED
IN SUCH A WAY

1072
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35.858
THAT IT'S ALIVE
WHEN IT SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE,

1073
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:40.429
AND THE TRUCK IS HOLDING HER
TOGETHER.

1074
01:26:40,463 --> 01:26:42.831
NOW, SHE DOESN'T FEEL MUCH,
AND SHE'S--

1075
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45.000
SHE'S TALKING
ALMOST LIKE NORMAL,

1076
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47.436
AND WE DIDN'T PULL THE TRUCK OUT
'CAUSE WE--

1077
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48.837
WE WANTED YOU
TO COME DOWN HERE

1078
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:52.941
AND BE WITH HER
AS LONG AS SHE'S AWAKE,

1079
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:55.378
AND THAT WON'T BE VERY LONG.

1080
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:01.384
NOW, FATHER, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU?

1081
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:06.021
- CAROLINE...

1082
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:09.392
IS THIS THE LAST TIME
I'M GONNA TALK WITH MY WIFE?

1083
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12.461
- YES, IT IS.

1084
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:37.586
- PEOPLE THINK THEY CAME HERE
TO TAKE OVER THE PLANET.

1085
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:41.424
THAT'S BULL.
I DON'T THINK THAT.

1086
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:42.658
MY FRIEND AND I SAW THEM.

1087
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:43.992
[radio crackling]

1088
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:46.662
- FOUND A PACK OF LIGHT BULBS.

1089
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:50.999
- THEY POISONED HIS FAMILY.
THEY DRAGGED THEM AWAY.

1090
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:54.503
NOBODY BELIEVES IT, BUT THEY
DIDN'T COME HERE FOR OUR PLANET.

1091
01:27:54,537 --> 01:27:55.671
THIS IS A RAID.

1092
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57.906
THEY CAME HERE FOR US,
TO HARVEST US.

1093
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:02.678
[radio crackling]

1094
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:05.648
LUCKY AS HELL THEY'RE LEAVING.

1095
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:07.416
- THEY'RE LEAVING?

1096
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:09.385
- THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

1097
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14.457
- HOW LONG
HAVE WE BEEN SLEEPING?

1098
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16.359
- 12 HOURS OR SO.

1099
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:18.694
[turns off radio]

1100
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22.097
HE SAID THEY HAD POISON GAS...

1101
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24.467
THEY SECRETE IN SMALL AMOUNTS.

1102
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:28.937
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED.

1103
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31.006
- BUT THEY'RE LEAVING.

1104
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33.108
- THEY LEFT REAL FAST
THIS MORNING,

1105
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35.010
LIKE SOMETHING SCARED
THEM OFF.

1106
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:37.012
THEY LEFT SOME
OF THEIR WOUNDED BEHIND.

1107
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:44.052
- WHY ARE THEY GOING?

1108
01:28:44,086 --> 01:28:47.022
- PEOPLE MUST HAVE FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO BEAT THEM.

1109
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:49.024
EVERYONE HAS
A WEAKNESS, RIGHT?

1110
01:28:56,532 --> 01:28:59.768
YOU DIDN'T THINK WE'D MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT, DID YOU?

1111
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03.439
- NO.

1112
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08.411
- LISTEN...

1113
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:14.082
THERE'S THINGS I CAN TAKE
AND A COUPLE THINGS I CAN'T.

1114
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:17.553
ONE OF THEM I CAN'T TAKE
IS WHEN MY OLDER BROTHER,

1115
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:20.756
WHO'S EVERYTHING I WANT TO BE,

1116
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:23.559
STARTS LOSING FAITH IN THINGS.

1117
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:29.398
I SAW YOUR EYES LAST NIGHT.

1118
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:31.667
I DON'T WANT TO EVER SEE
YOUR EYES LIKE THAT AGAIN.

1119
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33.602
'KAY?

1120
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:36.038
I'M SERIOUS.

1121
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:41.710
- OKAY.

1122
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:50.018
- HE'S BEEN LIKE THAT
FOR A WHILE.

1123
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:52.054
HE NEEDS HIS MEDICINE.

1124
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57.426
- HAVE THEY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT OUR AREA?

1125
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:00.729
- PHILADELPHIA AND ITS
OUTLYING COUNTIES ARE CLEARED...

1126
01:30:00,763 --> 01:30:02.765
BUT WHO KNOWS FOR SURE?

1127
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:06.702
- HE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

1128
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08.036
IF HE HAS ANOTHER ATTACK
RIGHT NOW--

1129
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09.572
- I KNOW.

1130
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:15.110
WE'D HAVE TO BE SURE BEFORE
WE OPENED UP THAT DOOR, GRAHAM.

1131
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35.030
[static hissing]

1132
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42.370
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
- ME, TOO.

1133
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:42.865
[news report
playing on TV]

1134
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:50.673
- GET THE SYRINGE AS WELL.

1135
01:31:50,706 --> 01:31:52.875
WE MAY NEED TO GIVE HIM
AN EPINEPHRINE SHOT.

1136
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16.098
[door creaks]

1137
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:18.901
- THE ATMOSPHERE HERE
IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

1138
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:21.570
- THEY'RE DOING THIS ON TV.

1139
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:23.438
- THERE'S
A GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF.

1140
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26.508
- THEY'RE DANCING?
- YEAH, LIKE THIS.

1141
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29.511
- AS WE BEGIN EVALUATING
THE LOSS OF LIFE--

1142
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31.680
- YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

1143
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:33.448
I'LL BRING THE TV IN HERE.

1144
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:35.718
- I SEE THE SAME EXPRESSION
ON EVERY FACE.

1145
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:38.553
WE KNOW THE BATTLE TURNED
AROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

1146
01:32:38,587 --> 01:32:39.855
THREE SMALL CITIES THERE

1147
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42.190
FOUND A PRIMITIVE METHOD
TO DEFEAT THEM.

1148
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:44.693
WE HAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS
AT THIS TIME.

1149
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:46.829
[TV turns off]

1150
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:16.491
- [clicking and chattering]

1151
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19.662
- MERRILL, WAIT.

1152
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:21.930
- [clicking and chattering]

1153
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58.701
- [clicking and chattering]

1154
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:22.524
- HI, SWEETIE.

1155
01:34:22,557 --> 01:34:24.659
- HI, BABY.

1156
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:28.897
- I WAS JUST TAKING A WALK
BEFORE DINNER.

1157
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32.835
- YOU LOVE WALKS.

1158
01:34:32,868 --> 01:34:35.570
- IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

1159
01:34:36,905 --> 01:34:39.541
- DOES IT HURT?

1160
01:34:39,574 --> 01:34:42.577
- I DON'T FEEL MUCH.
- GOOD.

1161
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:52.687
- TELL MORGAN...

1162
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:55.023
TO PLAY GAMES.

1163
01:34:55,057 --> 01:34:56.992
IT'S OKAY TO BE SILLY.

1164
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58.927
- [crying] I WILL.

1165
01:34:58,961 --> 01:35:01.997
- TELL BO
TO LISTEN TO HER BROTHER.

1166
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04.599
HE'LL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF HER.

1167
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:06.001
- I WILL.

1168
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:10.005
- AND TELL GRAHAM--
- I'M HERE.

1169
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12.775
- TELL HIM...

1170
01:35:12,808 --> 01:35:14.843
SEE.

1171
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17.612
TELL HIM TO SEE.

1172
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:24.086
AND TELL MERRILL
TO SWING AWAY.

1173
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30.058
- SEE, WHAT YOU
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS,

1174
01:35:30,092 --> 01:35:33.028
WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?

1175
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:37.032
ARE YOU THE KIND
THAT SEES SIGNS, SEES MIRACLES?

1176
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:40.502
OR DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE JUST GET LUCKY?

1177
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:45.473
IS IT POSSIBLE...

1178
01:35:45,507 --> 01:35:47.776
THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES?

1179
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:58.520
- [clicking and chattering]

1180
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17.139
- SWING AWAY, MERRILL.

1181

MERRILL...

1182
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23.946
SWING AWAY.

1183
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:46.835
- [screaming]

1184

[groaning]

1189
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:50.065
- AAH!

1190

- [gasping]

1191
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24.132
- THAT'S WHY HE HAD ASTHMA.

1192
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:30.973
IT CAN'T BE LUCK.

1193
01:38:31,006 --> 01:38:32.740
HIS LUNGS WERE CLOSED.

1194
01:38:32,774 --> 01:38:35.410
HIS LUNGS WERE CLOSED.
NO POISON GOT IN.

1195
01:38:35,443 --> 01:38:36.911
NO POISON GOT IN.

HIS LUNGS WERE CLOSED.

1197
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:40.148
HIS LUNGS WERE CLOSED.

1198
01:38:40,182 --> 01:38:42.350
DON'T TOUCH HIM.
GIVE HIM A MINUTE.

1199
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:47.389
- GRAHAM? [crying]

1200
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49.891
- GIVE HIM A SECOND.

1201
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:55.630
- DADDY?
- DON'T TOUCH HIM.

1202
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:58.000
- GRAHAM.

1203
01:39:00,135 --> 01:39:03.471
- DON'T...DON'T.

1204
01:39:05,207 --> 01:39:06.708
- DAD?

1205
01:39:08,176 --> 01:39:10.012
WHAT HAPPENED?

1206
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21.990
DID SOMEONE SAVE ME?

1207
01:39:24,492 --> 01:39:27.695
- YEAH, BABY,
I THINK SOMEONE DID.

1208
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:42.437
[Bo and Morgan laughing]
