1
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:45,922
<i>So this is the world.</i>

2
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,675
<i>And there are almost
six billion people on it.</i>

3
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:53,763
<i>When I was a kid there were three.
It's hard to keep up.</i>

4
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:58,309
<i>There, that's better. That's America.</i>

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,855
<i>See, America still sets
the tone for the world.</i>

6
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:07,902
<i>In Indiana, Clark Hodd, 13.
The best point guard in the country.</i>

7
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:12,490
<i>Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.</i>

8
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:16,870
<i>Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her in the next Olympics.</i>

9
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,832
<i>In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.</i>

10
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,252
<i>Her lawsuit helped pave the way
for women boxers everywhere.</i>

11
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,088
<i>She's picturing her ex-boyfriend
right now.</i>

12
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:31,259
<i>In Indio, California. Art Stallings.</i>

13
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,053
<i>Check out what pure joy looks like.</i>

14
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:38,224
<i>In Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.</i>

15
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>This April, 26 teams
will be falling over themselves...</i>

16
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>...to sign him in the next NFL draft.</i>

17
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,733
<i>He's my client.
My most important client.</i>

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,735
- When are you gonna try?
- I'm trying!

19
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:49,903
You wanna be a champion?

20
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,821
<i>Believe me.
There's genius everywhere.</i>

21
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,116
<i>But until they turn pro, it's like
popcorn in the pan. Some pop....</i>

22
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,619
Darn it! What the heck, coach?
You don't know diddly squat!

23
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,954
- Whoa! You little shit!
<i>- Some don't.</i>

24
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,209
<i>I'm the guy you don't usually see.</i>

25
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,796
<i>I'm the one behind the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.</i>

26
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,130
I'll hurt you this year.

27
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,757
- Hey, man. Good to see you.
- Hi.

28
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,008
- How you doing?
- Fine.

29
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,803
My door's always open
if you want to come and get a real agent.

30
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,763
- Well. thanks.
- You're welcome, Johnny.

31
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,557
I'm gonna go to a meeting right now.
Know who I'm gonna talk about?

32
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,893
You. Because I'd kill for you.
I'm an animal for you.

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,521
- We've gotta win Super Bowls.
- I hail you. I hail you.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,023
- Jerry, how are you doing?
- Good.

35
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,858
How much is this gonna cost me?

36
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,861
You and I both know there's
a number you can afford.

37
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,740
So I'm just gonna write it down.
We can move forward from there.

38
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:39,994
- I can't afford that.
- No one said winning was cheap.

39
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,039
<i>Know those photos where
the new player holds the jersey...</i>

40
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,666
<i>...and poses with the owner?</i>

41
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,793
<i>That's me on the left.</i>

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,254
<i>Inside that building, that's where I work.</i>

43
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,840
<i>SMI. Sports Management International.</i>

44
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,261
<i>Thirty-three out of shape agents
guiding the careers...</i>

45
00:02:56,427 --> 00:03:00,390
<i>...of 1685 of the most
finely tuned athletes alive.</i>

46
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:02,308
- You gotta be tough--
- I have 18 mill....

47
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,060
<i>I handle the lives and dreams...</i>

48
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:08,940
<i>...of 72 clients and get an average of
264 phone calls a day. It's what I do.</i>

49
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,817
I won't rest until you are
holding a Coke...

50
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,194
...wearing your own shoe,
playing a game featuring you...

51
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,613
...while singing your song
in a commercial starring you...

52
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,157
...broadcast during the Super Bowl
in a game you are winning.

53
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,701
I won't sleep until that happens.

54
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,287
<i>- It's what I do best.</i>
- Give you 15 minutes to call back.

55
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,872
<i>Now. I'll be honest with you.</i>

56
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,291
<i>I started noticing it a few years ago,
didn't say a word.</i>

57
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,459
Was the girl 16 or 17?

58
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,880
<i>In the quest for the big dollar,
a lot of little things were going wrong.</i>

59
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:36,509
Listen! There's no proof of anything
except this guy is a sensational athlete.

60
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,222
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

61
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:46,769
You know, I'm sorry, fella.
I can't sign this particular brand of card.

62
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:51,816
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- Just wanted an autograph.

63
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,319
<i>Lately, it's gotten worse.</i>

64
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,698
<i>Oh, he goes down!</i>

65
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:01,951
Hi, baby.

66
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,704
Do you know your name?

67
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,205
Um....

68
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,000
- Steve Remo.
- Um....

69
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,878
Steven Remo.

70
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,839
- Wait, it's coming.
- Steve Remo.

71
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,050
- My name is Steve Remo.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,887
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

73
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,306
Mm-hm. Hi, baby.

74
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:27,060
And this is my boy.
And this is, uh....

75
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,937
Uh....

76
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,438
Wait.

77
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,691
- My agent. My agent.
- Ha-ha-ha.

78
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,443
Oh, and I gotta play this weekend, doc.

79
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,655
If I play in 65 percent of my games,
I get a bonus.

80
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,282
- Shh.
- I gotta get the bonus.

81
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,743
Okay, Jesse.

82
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,245
- You take care, little guy.
- Mr. Maguire?

83
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,706
- Yeah?
- This is his fourth concussion.

84
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,876
- Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
- Hey, hey.

85
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:55,213
It would take a tank to stop your dad.

86
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,507
It would take all five...

87
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:02,553
...Super Trooper VR Warriors
to stop your dad.

88
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,972
Right?

89
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,308
Right?

90
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,645
Fuck you!

91
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:17,110
<i>Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?</i>

92
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:40,174
<i>--skyrocketing salaries,
and you are one of the guys responsible.</i>

93
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,386
<i>This guy is a sensational athlete.</i>

94
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:48,599
<i>Two days later, at our corporate
conference in Miami, a breakthrough.</i>

95
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,727
<i>I already have $18 million on the table....</i>

96
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,438
<i>Breakdown? Breakthrough.</i>

97
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,024
<i>- I just wanted an autograph.</i>
<i>- Fuck you.</i>

98
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,734
<i>Do you know your name?</i>

99
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:03,031
<i>I couldn't escape one simple thought:</i>

100
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,743
<i>I hated myself.</i>

101
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,038
<i>No, no, no. Here's what it was:</i>

102
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:14,250
<i>I hated my place in the world.</i>

103
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,384
<i>I had so much to say,
no one to listen.</i>

104
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,388
<i>And then it happened.</i>

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,146
<i>It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing.</i>

106
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,899
<i>I began writing
what they call a mission statement...</i>

107
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,151
<i>...not a memo. A mission statement.</i>

108
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,863
<i>You know, a suggestion
for the future of our company.</i>

109
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,201
<i>A night like this
doesn't come along very often.</i>

110
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,911
<i>I seized it.</i>

111
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,666
<i>What started out as one page
became 25.</i>

112
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,128
<i>Suddenly, I was my father's son again.</i>

113
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,589
<i>I was remembering the simple pleasures
of this job.</i>

114
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,508
<i>How I ended up here out of law school.</i>

115
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,093
<i>The way a stadium sounds...</i>

116
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,970
<i>...when one of my players
performs well on the field.</i>

117
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:12,683
<i>The way we are meant to protect them,
in health and in injury.</i>

118
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:17,230
<i>With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.</i>

119
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:22,401
<i>I wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote.
And I'm not even a writer.</i>

120
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,071
<i>I was remembering even the words
of the original sports agent...</i>

121
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,490
<i>...my mentor, the late, great Dicky Fox,
who said:</i>

122
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,786
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

123
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,999
<i>Suddenly, it was all pretty clear.
The answer was fewer clients.</i>

124
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,210
<i>Less money. More attention.</i>

125
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,421
<i>Caring for them, caring for ourselves
and the games too.</i>

126
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,217
<i>Just starting our lives really!</i>

127
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,052
<i>Hey, I'll be the first to admit...</i>

128
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,472
<i>...what I was writing
was somewhat touchy-feely.</i>

129
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,184
<i>I didn't care.
I had lost the ability to bullshit.</i>

130
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:59,147
<i>It was the me I'd always wanted to be.</i>

131
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,068
<i>I took it in a bag to a Copymat
in the middle of the night...</i>

132
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,528
<i>...and printed up 1 10 copies.</i>

133
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:09,198
<i>Even the cover looked like</i>
The Catcher in the Rye.

134
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,162
<i>I entitled it,</i>
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:

135
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,664
The Future of Our Business.

136
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,418
That's how you become great, man.

137
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,421
Hang your balls out there.

138
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,048
Thanks.

139
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,303
<i>- Everybody got a copy.</i>
<i>- There are dangerous animals...</i>

140
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,971

141

<i>Boom!</i>

145
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,000
Hi, this is Jerry Maguire.
Did those manuscripts get--?

146
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,210
<i>The mission statements?</i>

147
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,794
<i>- They've all gone out.</i>
- Oh, they did?

148
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,381
<i>- Would you like me to--?</i>
- Oh, no, no. That's fine.

149
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,217
Thank you.

150
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,872
- All right! Yeah!
- Finally, somebody said it.

151
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,294
- Good work, Maguire.
- Yeah, yeah!

152
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,129
Yeah!

153
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,050
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

154
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,480
<i>I was 35.</i>

155
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,316
<i>I'd started my life.</i>

156
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,362
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

157
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,332
You're with
the sports people on the plane?

158
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,917
Yeah, I'm Jerry Maguire, SMI.

159
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,711
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.

160
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,213
I'm producing the Coke commercials
for the playoffs.

161
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,424
Well, good luck with that.

162
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,093
Oh, hi.

163
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,013
Hi, my son is really allergic
to the material in the blankets.

164
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,307
- And I was wondering if--
- That's all we have, okay?

165
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,936
Oh....

166
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,524
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay.

167
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,151
- We're in it together now.
- Okay.

168
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,612
Why is it so easy to talk with you?
Tell me about your fiancée.

169
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,780
More champagne?

170
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,574
Don't think we're
quite at your pitch yet.

171
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:57,992
Oh, tell me how you proposed.

172
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,412
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice or something?

173
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:07,668
Thank you. But we're
hiking up through the pools.

174
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:11,088
Got the ring in my pocket.
I'm-- I'm a little nervous.

175
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,176
I'm lagging.
You know, she says to me...

176
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:18,596
...get this, "Hurry up, klutz."

177
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,556
Well, it bothered me somewhat.

178
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,517
You know, and I got quiet.
Then she got quiet.

179
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:28,439
And I decide I'm not gonna propose.
The mood is not right.

180
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,690
Why be impulsive?

181
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:34,153
Now at this point, I know she knows
that I was gonna propose and didn't.

182
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,488
And she knows I know.

183
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,449
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

184
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,411
But wait. Now, little do I know
that my assistant...

185
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,413
...has assumed that I've now proposed.

186
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,083
So she's gotten the lounge band
to actually play...

187
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,377
..."Here Comes The Bride"
when we walk back in.

188
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,753
I love that song.

189
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,130
All the football guys
are in the lobby watching.

190
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,966
There's even an ESPN crew.

191
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,637
So I turn to her, sort of grandly say:

192
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,640
"Well, this is me, klutz, asking you...

193
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,602
...goddess of rock climbing, to marry me."

194
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:12,191
I took out the ring. You know,
I mean, I don't much like big scenes...

195
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,653
...but she said yes
right there in the lobby.

196
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,906
Some of the toughest men
in football wept like babies.

197
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,035
- We're getting married in February.
- Oh, Jerry.

198
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,830
You two are gonna be married forever.

199
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:37,007
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First class is what's wrong, honey.

200
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,095
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

201
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,811
Ray?

202
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,939
Ray?!

203
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,316
Come on, buddy!

204
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,610
- High five!
- Ray!

205
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:00,823
- Oh, God. Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

206
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,617
Jerry Maguire.

207
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,413
I work in your office.
I was on a junket.

208
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,124
I know who you are.
You're Dorothy Boyd. You're in Accounts.

209
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,876
You have the side, middle cubicle...

210
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,546
...with a poster of Albert Einstein's face
morphed on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

211
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,799
That's pretty good.

212
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:23,637
- What--? What did you lose?
- My son, my mind.

213
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,225
Ray! Ray!

214
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,103
- While I look-- Dorothy. Dorothy?
- Huh?

215
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,354
While I go look for him...

216
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,732
...why don't you grab this curious
gentleman right here?

217
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,197
Oh! Oh, thank God. Oh!

218
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,160
You scared me.
You scared me!

219
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,747
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

220
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,750
Ever, ever, ever! Okay? Ever!

221
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,335
Dorothy?

222
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,920
- Oh.
- Take care.

223
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,047
Thank you so much.

224
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,677
I loved your memo, by the way.

225
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,890
- You did?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,356
Thanks. Uh, actually,
it was just a mission statement.

227
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,943
I think in this age,
optimism like that is a revolutionary act.

228
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,403
- You think so?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,616
Well, I appreciate that.
Because I didn't know if I should write it.

230
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,327
I mean, it was 2 in the morning.
I don't know.

231
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,247
Some of the stuff I just,
"Whoo!" you know. Ha-ha-ha.

232
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,958
No. That part about
how we should embrace...

233
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,335
...what is still virginal in our enthusiasm--

234
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,170
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Just a second.

235
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,422
--and force open
the tightly clenched fist of commerce...

236
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,259
...and give a little back
for the greater good.

237
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,053
- Uh-huh.
- God, I was inspired.

238
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,931
- And I'm an accountant, you know?
- One, two, three!

239
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,517
- Swing!
- I mean, to respect yourself enough...

240
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,644
- ...to say it out loud.
- Swing!

241
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,274
To put yourself out there
like that, so openly, so nakedly.

242
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:04,154
- I don't know. It got me.
- Swing! Whoo!

243
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,323
Swing!

244
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,201
- Is this bothering you?
- Whoo!

245
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,913
- No, this is great.
- Whoo!

246
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,916
- This is great.
- One, two, three! Swing!

247
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,752
Do you need a ride?
Are you--? You're okay?

248
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,421
- What?
- Do you need a lift?

249
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,881
- Swing!
- Oh, no! Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

250
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,843
Yeah, I'm sure that
would just make your day, huh?

251
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,928
To drive us all the way out
to Manhattan Beach.

252
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,055
Making that left
on little tiny Waterloo Street.

253
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:34,685
Playing chicken with the oncoming traffic.
Your life flashing before your eyes.

254
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,105
I've obviously had too much coffee, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

255
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,440
It's no problem.

256
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,695
Oh, there's my sister, Laurel,
to pick us up.

257
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,113
- Thanks.
- Sure.

258
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,450
Ray...

259
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,118
...Dorothy.

260
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,162
Pleasure.

261
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,664
Bye.

262
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,923
- Hey.
- Hi, Aunt Laurel.

263
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,051
I'm double-parked, let's go.

264
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:11,096
Sorry, honey. Is this everything?
These three.

265
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,308
- Come here.
- Dorothy?

266
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:19,730
Man, whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

267
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:26,445
Don't ever stop fucking me!

268
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,157
Sooner or later we'll have to stop!

269
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,912
Never been better! Never better!

270
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,205
Never better!

271
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,836
Open your eyes.

272
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:48,509
If you ever want me to be
with another woman for you, I would do it.

273
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,094
I'm not interested in it.

274
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,596
There was a time, yes,
it felt normal for me.

275
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,974
But it was a phase.
A college thing.

276
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,687
Like torn Levi's or law school for you.

277
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,981
Want anything from the kitchen?
I'm gonna get some fruit.

278
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,322
I don't think we need to do...

279
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,825
...the thing where
we tell each other everything.

280
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,202
Jerry, this is what intimacy is.

281
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,706
Oh, don't forget. Tomorrow,
we have dinner with Wade Cooksy.

282
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,958
I know about the bachelor party.

283
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,420
Jerry, your buddy Dooler worked
his ass off to make you a tribute film.

284
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:28,048
All those guys from the office are coming.
Everybody loves you.

285
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:33,762
Calm down, relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

286
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,390
Oh, no!

287
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:47,234
- Oh, my God. You! You!
- Sorry. Sorry.

288
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,278
Jerry!

289
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,782
- Got you! Ha, ha!
- Good to see you, buddy.

290
00:17:55,534 --> 00:18:00,539
- Hey, college buddy. Congratulations.
- Valhere. Valhere. Thank you.

291
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,417
- For you.
- Thank you.

292
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:08,964
And this is for you.
Finest cigar my club has to offer.

293
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,133
This is what it's all about, man.

294
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,386
Everybody loves you.

295
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,598
Pisses me off!

296
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,936
<i>Whether you're country,
redneck or a freak...</i>

297
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,690
<i>...young or old, from Moscow,
London or Memphis--</i>

298
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,150
<i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

299
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,402
<i>--will still be the king
of rock 'n' roll to me.</i>

300
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,529
Ha-ha-ha!
<i>- Jerry, Jerry. Jerry.</i>

301
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,032
<i>Little black book.</i>

302
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,701
<i>When I think about Jerry,
my heart starts pounding.</i>

303
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>- Ah.
- I know Jerry pretty well.</i>

304
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,539
<i>Hi, Jerry, remember me? Ha, ha.</i>

305
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,541
- We still on for lunch tomorrow?
- Yeah.

306
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,752
<i>He was no slouch in bed.</i>

307
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,214
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
You guys are crazy I'll see you later.

308
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,509
<i>--good idea that Jerry get married.
He won't be alone.</i>

309
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,513
<i>- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

310
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,972
<i>He's almost phobic.</i>

311
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:03,727
<i>I mean, Jerry is great at friendship,
he's just really bad at intimacy.</i>

312
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,064
<i>- He can't be alone.</i>
<i>- He can't be alone.</i>

313
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,566
<i>- He can't say, "I love you."</i>
<i>- You listening, Jerry?</i>

314
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,402
<i>Lies, lies, lies. He's an agent. He lies.</i>

315
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,073
<i>- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.</i>

316
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,826
<i>- Love you too.</i>
<i>- Love you.</i>

317
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,160
I love you, man.

318
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:26,083
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

319
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,764
Morning, Jenny.

320
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,684
Sorry I missed the bachelor party, Jerry.

321
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,435
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

322
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,438
Marcee's already in your office
and she's late for her plane to Phoenix.

323
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,648
Thank you, Wendy.

324
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,984
- Marcee.
- I'm glad to see you...

325
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,945
...finally made it.
Rod is very, very upset.

326
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,115
- Tyson, no!
- Okay, Mommy.

327
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,618
- Tyson, hello.
- Hello, Jerry. Long time no see!

328
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,288
- What did I say, Tyson?
- How can I make your life better?

329
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,915
Jerry, this is humiliating
and I'm pregnant...

330
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
...and I'm incapable of bullshit.

331
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,587
- Where is our offer from Arizona?
- Cronin's okay for lunch?

332
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,006
Marcee, this is one of our agents.
This is Bob Sugar.

333
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,841
- He needs to learn to knock.
- Pleasure.

334
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,887
- You've called our house, right?
- I'm sorry to interrupt you guys.

335
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,806
Now I don't know what you do
for your four percent...

336
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,934
...but this man,
my husband has a whole plan, an image.

337
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,563
And when you put him in a waterbed
warehouse commercial? Excuse me...

338
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:33,066
...you're making him common
when you know he deserves the big four:

339
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,069
Shoe, car, clothing, soft drink.

340
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,947
I know about the four jewels
of the celebrity endorsement.

341
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,366
- Wow.
- I majored in marketing, baby.

342
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,452
And so did my husband.
We came to play!

343
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,538
The dirty man is back!

344
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,253
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

345
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,258
You okay?

346
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:04,514
- Fine. What's up?
- Came here to let you go.

347
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,186
- Pardon me?
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

348
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,944
It's real. You should say something.

349
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,244
Shit.

350
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,167
A crowded restaurant
so there won't be a scene.

351
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,391
- You ungrateful--
- You should see yourself.

352
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,852
You said fewer clients, you put
it all down on paper. Jesus Christ.

353
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,813
What about me?
You know what I went through?

354
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,731
Knowing I was gonna
have to fire my mentor?

355
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,650
Carrying that around
in my head for a week?

356
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,069
Could you get past yourself for a second?
Jesus!

357
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,698
- You'll lose.
- You wanted smaller.

358
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,326
Oh, I'm over it. Now I want
all my clients and yours too.

359
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:08,912
Whatever.

360
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,599
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

361
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,742
- This is Cush.
<i>- Cush, it's Sugar.</i>

362
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,410
<i>Look, I'm calling you first...</i>

363
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,579
<i>...because you're the most important guy
in sports.</i>

364
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,206
<i>And I wanna know one thing.
How does that feel to be a legend?</i>

365
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,584
I just wanna play football.
Dad!

366
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,461
- Yeah.
- It's one of the agents.

367
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:01,715
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!
Call till you get through.

368
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,800
And please bring me my numbers!

369
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:07,763
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

370
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,433
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

371
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,310
- It's Martinez.
- They're interested.

372
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,437
Talk to Rick. Martinez.

373
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,609
Carlo, right now you pay 25 percent
on your endorsements to SMI.

374
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,361
I would cut my commission by 7 percent.

375
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:27,199
I don't wanna say it was drug-induced,
but the guy completely freaked out.

376
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:31,495
I don't know if you want him representing
you. I said my piece. How's your mom?

377
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,664
I'm gonna make this decision
easy for you.

378
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,793
Just what does your heart tell you?

379
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,421
I'm sorry to hear that.

380
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,133
I can't believe they fired him. He's gone.

381
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,969
Hey, what's going on?

382
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,889
They fired Jerry Maguire.
Did it at Cronin's.

383
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,309
SMI, this is Cleo. Hey!

384
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,353
No. Just listen to me.
SMI represents....

385
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,526
I think you're making a big mistake.
That's how I feel.

386
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,278
I'm concerned about your family.
I am concerned about your future.

387
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,364
If you stay here, I don't
know what'll happen.

388
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,699
I'm sorry. I have a long-standing
relationship with SMI.

389
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,867
You know, and I, uh....

390
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,787
Do you think Maguire knows
what it's like to be a black guy?

391
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,414
Bob Sugar? He's, uh....

392
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,126
He's entertaining, funny.

393
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,420
He said I don't know what it's like to be
a black person? I'm Mr. Black People!

394
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,966
Ha, ha. Like I said. I mean,
don't make it harder than it is.

395
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,137
I've got to be honest with you,
this is very personally distressing for me.

396
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,473
I haven't seen you since we were with
that stripper. You remember her name?

397
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,766
<i>- No.</i>
- I do, it was April.

398
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,769
That's my job. To remember the names
of skanks that you bang on the road.

399
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,438
That's what I do. It's not about
the money, I do it all for you.

400
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,899
This is Jerry Maguire.
Still holding for Katarina.

401
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,026
Hey, I'm talking about money, ho!

402
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,737
I gotta tell you-- You know what?
It's been a great day.

403
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,032
Are you in or out? It's not show friends.
It's show business.

404
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,161
You are in.

405
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:56,746
- That's good.
- Jerry...

406
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,541
...I wanna cry for what
they did to you at SMI.

407
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,086
<i>If we weren't right in the middle
of the Acura deal...</i>

408
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,921
<i>...you know I'd go with you.</i>

409
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,717
Oh, Jerry. Oh, God!

410
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,640
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

411
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,185
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me, Kathy.

412
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:27,694
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. So you're in?

413
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,822
Rod? Rod, Rod. Jerry Maguire.
How are you doing?

414
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,450
- Jerry Maguire!
<i>- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, how you doing?</i>

415
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,869
How am I doing?
I'll tell you how I'm doing.

416
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:40,123
I'm sweating. I'm sweating my contract.
I'm sweating Bob Sugar calling me...

417
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,709
...telling me I'm missing
the big endorsements being with you.

418
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,544
<i>That's how I'm doing. I'm sweating.</i>

419
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,172
No, I-- I hear what you're saying.
That's why I'm calling.

420
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,257
No, no, no.
I hear that you hear what I'm saying.

421
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,468
But do you truly hear what I'm saying?

422
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,470
I hear what you're saying, Daddy.

423
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,097
I think maybe the best thing
is that we get together in person.

424
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,892
I'm sorry.
Would you mind holding?

425
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,311
<i>Didn't you tell my wife more attention?</i>

426
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,148
Did you not tell my wife
more personal attention?

427
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,651
I said more personal attention.

428
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,361
<i>Good! We're just getting started...</i>

429
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,279
<i>...on my list of the things
you need to know.</i>

430
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,156
<i>You can take notes if you want to.</i>

431
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,076
I will kill for you, maim for you.
I will rape and pillage for you.

432
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,412
I am a valuable commodity!
I go across the middle.

433
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,998
I see a dude coming at me,
trying to kill me...

434
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,085
...I tell myself, "Get killed. Catch the ball."

435
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,129
Boo-yah! Touchdown!
I make miracles happen.

436
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,257
I just need to know
are you in or are you out?

437
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,883
<i>I'm from Arizona, Jerry.</i>

438
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,010
<i>- I broke Arizona records.</i>
- Rod?

439
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,514
I went to Arizona State!
I'm a Sun Devil, man!

440
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,683
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

441
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,018
<i>- I understand what you're saying--</i>
- I'm sitting here...

442
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,897
...with an ant problem. I got ants
going up and down my hallway.

443
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,608
My brother Tee Pee's room
is flooded with-- Look at this!

444
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,110
<i>- Rod.</i>
- We got a flood...

445
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,904
...in Tee Pee's room, Jerry. Hang on.
Say hello to Jerry Maguire.

446
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,448
<i>- Rod, listen.</i>
- Hello, brother Maguire.

447
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,658
Hello, Tee Pee.

448
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:00,453
Jerry, my house is falling apart!
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

449
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,372
We don't know where
we gonna live in a year.

450
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,375
And I'm supposed
to be a superstar, man!

451
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,461
Rod, I need a decision.
Are you in or are you out?

452
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,588
You'll be so happy
you stayed with Bob Sugar...

453
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,382
...because I am the fucking terminator!

454
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:17,595
<i>I am a role model.
I have a family to support! Hear me?</i>

455
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,515
I wanna stay in Arizona.
I want my new contract.

456
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,643
<i>But I like you. Yes, I like you.</i>

457
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,856
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

458
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,151
- I will stay with you.
- That's great. I'm very happy.

459
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,694
<i>- Are you listening?</i>
- Yes.

460
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,989
<i>That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless you, Jerry.</i>

461
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,743
<i>This is what you'll do for me--
Are you listening? Jerry?</i>

462
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,913
What can I do for you?
Just tell me, what can I do?

463
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:48,084
It's a very personal,
very important thing.

464
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,086
Hell, it's a family motto.

465
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,629
<i>- Are you ready, Jerry?</i>
- Ready.

466
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,923
<i>I just wanna make sure
you're ready, brother.</i>

467
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,176
Here it is:

468
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,512
Show me the money.

469
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,224
Show...

470
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,395
<i>...me the...</i>

471
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,356
...money!

472
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,442
Jerry, doesn't that make
you feel good?

473
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,404
<i>- Say it with me, Jerry.</i>
- Show you the money.

474
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,866
You can do better than that! Say it!

475
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:24,204
<i>- Bob Sugar's on the other line.</i>
- Show you the money.

476
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:28,917
- No, not you, show me the money.
<i>- Show me the money.</i>

477
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,127
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

478
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:34,130
- That's it, but you got to yell!
<i>- Show me the money!</i>

479
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,800
- I need to feel you.
<i>- Show me the money!</i>

480
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,009
Jerry, you better yell.

481
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,887
Show me the money!

482
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,766
Show me the money!

483
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,019
- Say you love this black man.
- I love the black man!

484
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:51,564
- Show me the money!
- I love black people!

485
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,400
I love black people!

486
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,404
- Who's your motherfucker?
- You're my motherfucker!

487
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,908
- What you gonna do, Jerry? Unh.
- Show me the money!

488
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,911
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

489
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:40,530
Well, don't worry. Don't worry.

490
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,283
I'm not gonna do what you all
think I'm gonna do...

491
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,577
...which is just flip out!

492
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,710
Let me just say as I...

493
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:58,381
...ease out of the office I helped build.

494
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,342
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

495
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:05,805
...that there is such a thing as manners.

496
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,767
A way of treating people.

497
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,481
These fish have manners.

498
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,358
These fish have manners.

499
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:21,488
In fact, they're coming with me.
I'm starting a new company...

500
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,699
...and the fish will come with me.

501
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,952
You can call me sentimental...

502
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,122
...but the fish are coming with me.

503
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,835
Come on. Come on. Come on.

504
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,091
Okay.

505
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,390
If anybody else
wants to come with me...

506
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,769
...this will be a moment of something...

507
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:56,231
...real and fun and inspiring...

508
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:59,275
...in this godforsaken business...

509
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,945
...and we will do it together.

510
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,574
Who's coming with me?

511
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,451
Who's coming with me?

512
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,246
Who's coming with me?!

513
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:19,254
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

514
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,887
This is embarrassing.

515
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,644
All right.

516
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,689
Wendy.

517
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,817
- Shall we?
- Oh, Jerry...

518
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,404
...I'm three months away
from the pay increase.

519
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,655
I....

520
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,493
Okay.

521
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,996
Okay.

522
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,298
I will go with you.

523
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,759
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

524
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,727
Right now?

525
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,897
- Don't do it.
- Shh!

526
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,822
Bye.

527
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:40,752
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

528
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:41,961
Bye.

529
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,757
Let's see how they do without us.

530
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,980
- I'll just--
- Oh. Thank you.

531
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:05,026
I know this is a bad time, but
you will have a medical program, right?

532
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,654
Oh, sure, yes, medical.

533
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,573
I don't know.

534
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,994
When you think about
what you did, don't panic.

535
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:18,164
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be great.

536
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,084
We're gonna be great!

537
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,286
I wonder what he said.

538
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,331
My favorite aunt is
hearing-impaired.

539
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:03,918
He just said,
"You complete me."

540
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:29,736
That's an excellent point.
We come to support each other...

541
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,822
...but we don't listen to one another.

542
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:37,243
Women are taught not to
see each other as good people.

543
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:42,081
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men, jobs--

544
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,250
It's true, we compete.

545
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,253
I used to really hate women.

546
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,674
And then I met you guys,
and you're like me.

547
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,553
It's important because
I know you can be my friends.

548
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,015
- What about medical?
- Of course medical.

549
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,809
A single mother can't be frivolous.

550
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,729
If you read what he wrote,
you'd have left too.

551
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,356
And I can always take that job
in San Diego.

552
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,527
- Do you know the cost of child exams?
- Yes, $150.

553
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,613
And that's when he's well.

554
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,948
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

555
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,827
That's wonderful.
Next time you lecture me...

556
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:24,457
...don't leave my boy in that room
with that divorced women's group.

557
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,668
So I finally, finally
got in touch with my anger.

558
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,306
What did I do?

559
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:45,353
Function, function.
Forward motion is everything.

560
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,022
Cush saves all.

561
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:52,693
You go to Texas. You keep
one superstar, and they'll all follow.

562
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,570
- There's no loyalty.
- None.

563
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,157
The first person
who told me that was you.

564
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:02,036
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

565
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:07,500
And I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Ma-fucking-guire!

566
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,461
- That's right.
- King of the house calls.

567
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,589
- Master of the living room.
- Okay, okay.

568
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,344
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

569
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,056
- Who said anything about "loser"?
- Mistake.

570
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:25,560
I meant something else.
When do you wanna leave?

571
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,466
I'm in the back den, Jerry.

572
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,679
- Hey, you like a bloody beer?
- I'm fine.

573
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,599
Beer and tomato juice. Huh?

574
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,225
I'm fine.

575
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,270
We've spent a lot
of time together, Matt.

576
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,064
You know I care about you
and your son.

577
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:16,277
You know I'm a straight shooter.
If you stay with SMI--

578
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,447
We decided to stay with you.

579
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:26,287
Ha! Oh. Okay.

580
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,581
- I'm not really a hugger. And yet...
- Ha-ha-ha.

581
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,334
- ...I can't let go.
- Ha, ha.

582
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,589
I told myself, "If he shows up,
we stick with him."

583
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,215
- Hey!
- Whoa.

584
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:41,677
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

585
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:44,096
How are you, Cush? How are you?

586
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,599
- You remember Keith?
- Yeah. How you doing?

587
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:51,437
I want him to go number one
in the draft, and I want him to play.

588
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:55,149
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
He'll go number one.

589
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,652
I'll either surf or ski. Ha-ha-ha.

590
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:01,530
- Denver's where he should be.
- I'll give it everything.

591
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:06,619
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have is my word.

592
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,039
And it's stronger than oak.

593
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,583
Whoo!

594
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,801
- Hello.
- Dorothy? Jerry Maguire.

595
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,594
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Is Avery there?

596
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,348
She had to fly to Atlanta.
She had a meeting at the NFL.

597
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,641
Rocks, Dottie. Wait--

598
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,351
Wait-- Oh, God. Oh.

599
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,937
- Jerry.
- Hello? Hello? Hello?

600
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:20,484
- Sorry, that was my son and the nanny.
<i>- What are they all doing in our office?</i>

601
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,904
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.
<i>- Dorothy?</i>

602
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,157
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yeah. I had the calls transferred...

603
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,743
...to my house so that I could
go over some of your stuff.

604
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,620
<i>That's fine. Dorothy, we are back.</i>

605
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,957
We are so very, very back.

606
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,293
I resigned Cush. We're set.

607
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,963
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

608
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,467
Happy for us. Okay, happy for us.

609
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,386
Rod, being at the draft
with me is a good idea. Trust me.

610
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:51,891
No, Rod, just get on the plane
and meet us at the gate, okay?

611
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,727
- Good. We'll see you there.
<i>- God bless you.</i>

612
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,397
Okay, Avery will meet you
at the B-gate at 4:15. Don't be late.

613
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:02,568
Jerry, do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

614
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,654
Did you know Troy Aikman,
in only six years...

615
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:09,116
...has passed for 16,303 yards?

616
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,286
Do you know bees and dogs
can smell fear?

617
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,081
Oh, I booked Tidwell on the same floor
at the Marriott Marquis.

618
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,708
- He doesn't smoke, does he?
- I don't know.

619
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,587
Did you know the career record
for most hits is 4256 by Pete Rose...

620
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:23,339
...who is not in the Hall of Fame?

621
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,675
Do you know that my next door neighbor
has three rabbits?

622
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,305
I can't compete with that.

623
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,351
Okay, so did we go
over everything? Yes?

624
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:38,145
- Yep.
- Back on Tuesday, right?

625
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,980
Yeah.

626
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,194
Ray, have a good time at school.
Wish me luck.

627
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,488
Luck!

628
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,010
- Hey, Rod.
- Hey, Jerry--

629
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,640
Cush, how are you, man?

630
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,643
Jerry, we should be selling these.

631
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:21,397
Terrific. This is my agent,
you might want his autograph. Heh, heh.

632
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,357
Man, my hand's getting tired.

633
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:26,402
- Excuse me.
- Hey, what's happening?

634
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,903
Are you Hootie?

635
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:32,658
No, I am not Hootie.

636
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,083
What is it gonna be,
San Diego or Denver?

637
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,210
I'll surf or ski.

638
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,675
He'll either surf or ski.

639
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:00,686
Rod, at last I find you.

640
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,731
What am I doing here?
I feel like I'm five years late for the prom.

641
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:05,232
Come on. Come with me.

642
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,401
Nobody gives a damn
about me being here.

643
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,487
We're gonna go downstairs
and we're gonna walk through this lobby.

644
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,365
Because I want every media guy,
every player's rep...

645
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,993
...everybody to see you
for what you are:

646
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,370
The best-kept secret
in the NFL.

647
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,750
The most commanding wide receiver
in the game.

648
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,794
You are fast, fierce, wildly charismatic.

649
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,714
You are the man.
You are the man. You ready?

650
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:30,799
- Let's go.
- Let's walk.

651
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,971
The fiercest.
You are the man.

652
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:38,307
- Let's do it.
<i>- Hi, Mel. How are you?</i>

653
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:40,017
- Good to see you.
- How you doing? Tom.

654
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,019
- How's it going? Upstairs.
- Where's Cush?

655
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,104
Good thing you were able
to hang onto Cushman.

656
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,522
What'll it be? San Diego or Denver?

657
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,691
We'll know tomorrow.
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell.

658
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:49,568
- How you doing?
- Arizona, 110 receptions...

659
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,987
- ...1550 yards last year.
- How you doing, baby?

660
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,448
I'd like you to meet Rod Tidwell.

661
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,075
What's up, man?

662
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,619
- Rod Tidwell--
- How you doing?

663
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,872
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell.

664
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,832
- How are you, Rod?
- Good, hey.

665
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,418
- Rod ran for 1150 yards last year.
- That's right.

666
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,422
- Good? Good.
- I'm doing great, baby.

667
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:15,511
Now I wanna talk about Rod Tidwell.
He's the fiercest wide receiver in the NFL.

668
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,930
- Hey, man. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

669
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,941
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby. Heh.

670
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:32,069
Yeah. It might have
even worked too.

671
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,697
Yeah? Shit. Let's do that shit again.

672
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,283
Hey, hey. Stop.

673
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,327
Shooting a Reebok ad down there.
Hey, Jerry...

674
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:42,538
...where are my endorsements?
Know what I'm saying?

675
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:46,458
You know, I didn't get no love from
Chevy. I didn't get no love from Pepsi.

676
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,420
Shit. I didn't even get no love
from that little Energizer Bunny.

677
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,755
- I didn't get no love from Nike.
- Rod--

678
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,841
Obviously, I didn't get love from Reebok.

679
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,968
Did I ever tell you
about my Reebok story?

680
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:58,137
Rod, I gotta get back to Cushman.

681
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:00,347
Oh, you gotta get back
to your golden paycheck.

682
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:03,976
But wait. Just, I'll boil it down for you.

683
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,853
Fuck Reebok!

684
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,605
All they do is ignore me. Always have.

685
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,941
Always have.

686
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:12,693
Know what was great
about you down there?

687
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,238
For about five minutes,
you unloaded that rather large chip...

688
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,198
...that resides right there
on your shoulder.

689
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,826
And you know what?
You let people in.

690
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,330
You were brilliant.

691
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:26,874
- Brilliant?
- Brilliant.

692
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:30,544
- Really?
- Now take care, I'll see you tomorrow.

693
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:33,088
- You're loving me now, aren't you?
- I'm not about love.

694
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:34,673
I'm about showing you the money!

695
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:38,886
I-- I was just testing you, Jerry.
But to hear you say that...

696
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:42,514
...makes me love you, baby. You know?

697
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,850
Jerry, come back!

698
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:49,313
- How was your flight?
- Good. How was yours?

699
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,065
- Good.
- Hey, man. What size are you?

700
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,399
Twelve and a half.

701
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,361
Grab a couple pairs
of them new shoes by the door.

702
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,539
Cush, Matt, we have
a decision to make.

703
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:13,504
San Diego just came in
with a last-minute scenario. It's big.

704
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:16,465
- Well, he's got to go number one.
- Oh, he still goes number one.

705
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:20,636
But San Diego wants to trade up
with Denver. They want him bad.

706
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:21,845
What happened to Denver?

707
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,431
This stuff happens the night
before a draft. People get crazy.

708
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,266
Let me tell you something.
San Diego, Matt--

709
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,602
San Diego is crazy...

710
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:31,814
...to the tune of seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

711
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,066
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Reporters, Jerry.

712
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,734
They've been calling all night long.

713
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,820
You just be friendly
and you say, "No comment."

714
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,363
We'll tell the world in 12 hours.

715
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,325
Talking and saying nothing, man.
It is an art I have not mastered.

716
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:47,287
Well, let me do that....

717
00:45:47,538 --> 00:45:50,082
For you, it's a pleasure.

718
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,876
- This is Cush.
- Ha, ha.

719
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,629
<i>It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Just sniff if he's there.</i>

720
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,340
Okay. All right, buddy.

721
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,634
Dude, remember.
You're swimming with the big boys now.

722
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,469
<i>You let your dad do all the talking.</i>

723
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:04,847
<i>Remember I'm the one
that got you the deal you needed.</i>

724
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:08,517
<i>This is business, not friendship.
You gotta be strong...</i>

725
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,145
<i>...because you're global now.
Worldwide.</i>

726
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:15,232
Okay, buddy?
I'll see you later. Bye.

727
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:21,196
No comment.

728
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:30,998
- He's got it all wrong.
- Hey, it's Cush on the big TV again.

729
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:33,959
I'm sick of me, already.
I got Cush-lash.

730
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,599
Now, Matt,
before I go back to Denver...

731
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,684
...I think we should put something down
on paper.

732
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:53,395
You know, something that says,
"Hey, I'm with Jerry Maguire."

733
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:56,064
Not right now, Jerry.

734
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:05,991
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

735
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,664
You fellas aren't talking
with Bob Sugar, are you?

736
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,044
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
with him instead of you.

737
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,756
Said who? Sugar?

738
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:23,842
I'm learning as I go here.

739
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:28,931
So you empowered Bob Sugar
to deal with Denver behind my back?

740
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:31,266
I'm sorry. I, uh....

741
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:36,104
- I love my son.
- I love your son. I love your son!

742
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:41,360
I brought Denver to 20 million.
Denver deals with me all the time.

743
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,781
You listened to Sugar.
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

744
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:49,701
You let that snake in the door?

745
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,913
Okay, hey, Matt.

746
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,793
Listen, rookie mistake. You want Denver.
I'll fix this whole thing up for you.

747
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,420
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

748
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:07,928
Matt? Tell me you didn't sign.

749
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:11,682
Tell me you didn't sign because
I'm still sort of moved by your...

750
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:15,852
..."my word is stronger than oak" thing.

751
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:20,399
We signed an hour ago.

752
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:25,153
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

753
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:31,702
Sorry, Jerry. I just want to play football.

754
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:39,334
- What do I do? How do I spin this?
- Oh, honey, it's spun.

755
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,962
What did I do to you?

756
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,047
It's all about you, isn't it?

757
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:46,174
"Soothe me, save me, love me."

758
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:48,760
- Would you stop moving?
- I have to finish my job.

759
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,513
Everything's on the fucking run with us.
Everything.

760
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,350
Jerry, you and I are sales people.
We sell.

761
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:57,019
- Look, I don't--
- It's not "Love me."

762
00:48:57,185 --> 00:49:00,522
It's not "Trust my handshake."
It's "Make the sale! Get it signed."

763
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,691
- There shouldn't be confusion about that.
- Okay.

764
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:04,818
Jump right into my nightmare.
The water is warm.

765
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:08,196
Oh, so honestly is outlawed here?
I can't be honest?

766
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,324
Tell you what,
I would prefer loyalty.

767
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,452
What was our deal
when we were first got together?

768
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,537
Brutal truth. Remember?

769
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:18,915
I think you added the "brutal."

770
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:24,546
Jerry, there is a sensitivity thing
that some people have. I don't have it.

771
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,924
I don't cry at movies.
I don't gush over babies.

772
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:30,385
I don't start celebrating
Christmas five months early.

773
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,929
And I don't tell a man who
just screwed up both our lives:

774
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:37,893
"Oh, poor baby."
That's me, for better or worse.

775
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,936
But I do love you.

776
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:45,317
- Avery....
- No.

777
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:47,402
- It's over.
- I didn't hear it.

778
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:50,322
There's something missing here.
Don't you think?

779
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:51,990
You have never been alone.

780
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,117
- Listen to me.
- And you can't be alone.

781
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,286
It's over.

782
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:02,793
No one has ever dumped me.

783
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,171
I'm not trying to make history here.

784
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:10,592
I did the 23-hour nose route
to the top of El Capitan...

785
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:15,097
...in 18 hours and 23 minutes.
I can make this work.

786
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,935
No.

787
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:23,063
Oh, Jerry.

788
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:34,324
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

789
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:48,547
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

790
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,014
Roll with the punches.
Tomorrow's another day.

791
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,226
Taxi!

792
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,146
You're loving me now, aren't you?

793
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:07,524
Very much. Taxi!

794
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,278
Is it my imagination
or didn't we arrive in a limo?

795
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:13,113
<i>The question I have to say to you is this.</i>

796
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,867
<i>And I hope this doesn't come off
too much like I'm a shrink here, okay.</i>

797
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:21,371
<i>- What's wrong?
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.</i>

798
00:51:22,873 --> 00:51:27,252
Jerry, everybody cries on this show.

799
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:30,297
You're mad you tested positive?
Quit doing blow.

800
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,718
Upset about your baby girl?
Why'd you leave the mother?

801
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:36,303
I knew her, she was all right.

802
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,472
<i>People like media,
they don't understand...</i>

803
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:41,558
<i>...what kind of problems and pressures
$54 million comes with.</i>

804
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:46,480
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

805
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:52,319
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

806
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:55,447
I am fucked.

807
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:58,825
Twenty-four hours ago, man, I was hot.

808
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:00,660
Now....

809
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:03,413
I'm a cautionary tale.

810
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,540
You see this jacket I'm wearing?
You like it?

811
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,668
Because I don't really need it
because I'm cloaked in failure!

812
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:12,547
I lost the number one draft pick
the night before the draft!

813
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:14,716
Why? Let's recap.

814
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:19,554
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel like a superficial jerk.

815
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:23,850
I ate two slices of bad pizza,
went to bed and grew a conscience!

816
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:28,522
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.

817
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,235
I got a shelf life of 10 years tops.

818
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:38,573
My next contract has got to bring dollars
that'll last me and mine a very long time.

819
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,409
Shit, I'm out of this sport in five years.

820
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,870
What's my family gonna live on?

821
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:47,374
Huh? What you get me.

822
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,501
So I don't wanna hear your shit, Jerry.

823
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:54,673
I don't want to hear your "Nah, nah, nah.
Oh, I lost Cush and Avery" and shit.

824
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,509
Could I have another drink, please?
Could I--?

825
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,762
Anybody else would have
left you by now.

826
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:04,349
But I'm sticking with you.
I said I would.

827
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,436
And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro,
you gonna show me the money.

828
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:11,147
You gonna show me the money.

829
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:16,862
We together on this. You know
what I'm saying? We gonna be one.

830
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,951
The both of us! You know?!

831
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,537
Oh, my God.

832
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,668
<i>You have no messages.</i>

833
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,238
- He's coming over.
- Tonight?

834
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,408
He just lost his best client.
I invited the guy over.

835
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,536
Dorothy, this is not a guy.
It's a syndrome.

836
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:08,997
"Early midlife,
hanging onto the bottom rung.

837
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,334
Dear God, don't let me be alone. I'll
call my newly long-suffering assistant...

838
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,836
...without medical for company"
syndrome. If knowing that...

839
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,963
...you still want him to come over,
I'm not saying a thing.

840
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,715
Honey, he's engaged.

841
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,259
And for the first time
in my professional life...

842
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,470
...I'm part of something that I believe in.

843
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,932
Okay. But he better not be good-looking!

844
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:30,644
Hi.

845
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,981
I'm Jerry Maguire.

846
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:40,779
Hello. You're just the way
I pictured you.

847
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:45,200
- I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.
- Honesty.

848
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,244
- Thank you.
- Mm. Mm.

849
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:52,040
Thank you. Dorothy!

850
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:58,964
Dorothy, your boss is here.

851
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:00,632
Hello.

852
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:04,844
- Oh, careful.
- Ho!

853
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,471
Hey, you.

854
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:09,349
- Hi, hi. Thanks for inviting me over.
- Sure.

855
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,311
Where's--? Where's the little guy?

856
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,146
- He's sleeping.
- Oh, yeah. Sleeping.

857
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:18,525
I'm so glad you're home.

858
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:23,405
You know, just,
that alone thing is not my specialty.

859
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:24,864
Oh, my God!

860
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,825
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

861
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:33,206
Well, I broke up with Avery. Heh, heh.

862
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,042
Just, uh....

863
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:42,841
- That-- Gosh, you know, that's too bad.
- No, it's better...

864
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:46,594
...because we'll still be friends.
And it's better now than later.

865
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,805
- Sure, sure.
- You know what I mean....

866
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:54,561
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- It's a really bad cut.

867
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:57,939
Just think if I got her
the ring she really wanted.

868
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:06,281
- Yeah.
- Why don't you have a seat?

869
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,450
I'll, uh....

870
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:12,954
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

871
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,541
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

872
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:23,506
I heard.

873
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,344
No kidding. I saw the shadow
of curious shoes under the door.

874
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,557
He'd go home with a gardening tool
if it showed interest.

875
00:56:33,475 --> 00:56:35,769
Don't use those.
Use the frosted glasses.

876
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:37,812
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

877
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:41,566
- I warmed up some chicken.
- Oh! That's the girl I love.

878
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:44,402
I'm not gonna say anything.
I'm just gonna say this:

879
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,821
- You've always been responsible with Ray.
- Don't start.

880
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,742
I don't think it's right for him to wake up
and hear some strange man's voice.

881
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:54,079
- Some drunken stranger.
- As opposed to 10 angry women?

882
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,914
- Whoa!
- Ow!

883
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:59,501
Lean forward.
Okay, I've got it.

884
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:01,503
It's still edible.
Change your shirt.

885
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,379
- Oh.
- Everything's fine.

886
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,137
Hi, Jerry.

887
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:17,852
Hi, Ray.
Aren't you supposed to be in bed?

888
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:20,105
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

889
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,526
Don't worry, I won't tell.

890
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,947
The human head weighs eight pounds.

891
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:42,794
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

892
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,923
<i>You should
be dreaming about me, baby.</i>

893
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,508
<i>I should be on your mind constantly.</i>

894
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:50,343
<i>My agent should be thinking,
"Rod Tidwell."</i>

895
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,220
<i>That's when the big dollars
are gonna flow.</i>

896
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,597
<i>That's when we truly
will materialize the kwan.</i>

897
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:56,683
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

898
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,810
You are speaking to the Rod Tidwell.

899
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,312
I need to speak with my agent.
I need to be my agent.

900
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:02,772
<i>My agent and I should be one.</i>

901
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,607
Are you a football player?

902
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:06,484
<i>Am I a football player?</i>

903
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,404
<i>I'm a school teacher
about to whomp your ass!</i>

904
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,406
Put Jerry Maguire on the phone!

905
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:15,118
Just one more thing. You don't have the
luxury of falling for some drowning man.

906
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,203
- Be practical.
- Practical?

907
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,040
Which top? High turtleneck, sensible.
Low V-neck, sexy. Turtleneck, turtleneck.

908
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,709
Don't tell me to be practical.

909
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:26,045
Do you know what other women
my age doing right now?

910
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:29,632
They're out partying,
trying to get a man.

911
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:33,845
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

912
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:39,684
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for the rest of my life.

913
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:44,314
- I've had three lovers in four years.
- That's not bad.

914
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:48,902
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

915
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:53,656
Look at me. I'm the oldest
26-year-old in the world.

916
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:55,992
- Now, how do I look?
- Good.

917
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,077
Yeah? Thanks.

918
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:01,039
<i>Seventy-two percent
of new buyers are African-American.</i>

919
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:02,749
<i>I am African-American.</i>

920
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:04,083
You talk too much.

921
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,295
<i>Talking is only a primitive
form of communication.</i>

922
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:10,298
- It was fun talking to you. Bye, Rod.
<i>- Jerry--!</i>

923
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:12,842
- I'll make a sandwich.
- Good idea.

924
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:15,470
- Ham sandwich.
- I wanna say one thing.

925
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,806
- You do listen to me.
- Well, I love you. Mayo?

926
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:22,810
Yeah.
--repression, as a religion.

927
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:27,065
When my daddy retired from
the United Way after 38 years...

928
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:30,693
...he said, "I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

929
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,155
Wait, wait, wait.
And then my dad died.

930
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:38,826
My mom took me to the zoo,
and I loved the zoo. And--

931
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,203
Wait.

932
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:45,166
- I want to tell you more about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

933
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,378
Okay, okay....

934
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:49,963
You're right. Heh, heh.

935
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:54,592
It's just my whole life,
I've been trying to talk. I mean...

936
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:57,303
...really talk.

937
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:01,432
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

938
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,645
- They just look at you--
- Let's go right now, let's go to the zoo.

939
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:10,608
Ray, the zoo, you know--
The fucking zoo's closed, Ray.

940
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,613
You said "fuck."

941
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,741
Yeah, I did. I....

942
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:21,494
- Is that--?
- I won't tell.

943
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:28,584
Well, then I'm gonna
have to take you to the zoo.

944
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:35,675
- I gotta go to bed, my mom's coming.
- Ooh, wait, uh--

945
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:39,721
I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed.

946
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,141
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

947
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:49,605
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

948
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,318
Good idea.

949
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:57,155
Oh, and we should keep our voices
down. I have a little boy asleep.

950
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,282
Right.

951
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,242
Our company.

952
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:10,460
Okay, okay. Look. A little....
A little speech before I go.

953
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:20,595
Do not worry about your future.

954
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,892
You and your son, we, are just fine.

955
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:27,977
You still have a job.

956
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:33,608
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire, okay?

957
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:38,029
You come after me,
and you will lose.

958
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,493
No, because I am a survivor.
I'm a survivor!

959
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:49,540
Dorothy Boyd, you are
with the Lord of the Living Room.

960
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,835
The King of the Kingdom!

961
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:55,296
And I am...

962
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:00,426
...drunk.

963
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,771
We meet again.

964
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:27,286
Here.

965
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,881
Truth?

966
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:45,388
- Sure.
- I care about the job, of course.

967
01:02:45,555 --> 01:02:48,975
But mostly, I just want to be inspired.

968
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:51,936
Me too.

969
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,522
What you wrote inspired me.

970
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,191
No, no, no. No, hey.

971
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:01,237
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

972
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,907
I loved that memo.

973
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,830
It's a mission statement.

974
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,803
Well....

975
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:28,306
Sorry about the hand.

976
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:29,599
Huh?

977
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,813
You know that feeling?

978
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:39,775
You're not completely
embarrassed yet...

979
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:43,237
...but you glimpse
tomorrow's embarrassment?

980
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:46,449
Don't worry about it, boss.

981
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,368
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

982
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,997
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

983
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:57,710
- No, don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
- I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas.

984
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:02,590
- I'm, like, harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue. Ha-ha-ha.

985
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:17,855
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

986
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,903
Look, don't worry, okay?
I mean, don't--

987
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:29,909
We'll be okay because
I am gonna take my one client...

988
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:34,205
...and we are gonna go all the way.

989
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:39,502
Because, hey.... I'm back.

990
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,215
Don't worry.

991
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:03,818
- Way to go, Rod. Good catch.
- You can't--

992
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,196
All right, good job.

993
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:15,204
- Gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.
- Meet me at The Crocodile, 8:00.

994
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:17,582
You bet.

995
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,502
Yeah.

996
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:38,936
Thank you.

997
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:41,063
<i>Tell me you got lost
on the way last night.</i>

998
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,898
<i>I know you wouldn't do that
to a friend.</i>

999
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:45,276
- Something came up.
<i>- It's okay.</i>

1000
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,445
<i>$10 million for four years.</i>

1001
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:50,239
<i>- You're dreaming.</i>
- Ten for four. It's a deal.

1002
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,949
<i>Look.</i>

1003
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:57,121
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me. I can help you.

1004
01:05:57,288 --> 01:05:59,040
- He's a shrimp.
- A shrimp?

1005
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:01,792
Rod broke every receiving record
you had last year.

1006
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,005
I want a prototypical
wide receiver who's 6'3", 220.

1007
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:09,508
<i>Not some guy
who's 5'10" and bitches.</i>

1008
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:13,054
Dennis, I'm asking you...

1009
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:15,806
...for a favor.

1010
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:21,687
<i>I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmases together.</i>

1011
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:26,025
<i>- Holiday cheer. Dennis.</i>
- Jerry, you're reaching.

1012
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:30,863
I'm asking you for a favor. Don't do
this to me. We have history, Dennis.

1013
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:35,910
We got history, all right, Jerry.
You drove the prices up on me for years.

1014
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:41,499
- It's your turn at the back of the line.
- No, no. Dennis, don't--

1015
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:50,591
I started talking with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation this morning.

1016
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,222
Talking?

1017
01:06:56,681 --> 01:07:01,852
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter.
I smoked all these fools!

1018
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,062
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,898
Yet they are making the big sweet dollar.

1020
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:10,820
They are making the kwan.
And you're talking.

1021
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:18,035
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Hell yeah, that's my word.

1022
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:22,206
Some dudes might have coin,
but they'll never have kwan.

1023
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:23,541
What is--?

1024
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:29,130
It means love, respect, community
and dollars. The entire package.

1025
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,341
The kwan.

1026
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:34,593
Great word.

1027
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:39,598
- Towel?
- No, I air-dry.

1028
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:46,564
Listen, Rod. I say this
with great respect for you.

1029
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:51,610
But those players you mentioned
are marquee players.

1030
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:57,241
- And this deal where, you know, we--
- Marquee?

1031
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:01,120
Here's what I'm saying. This is a
renegotiation. We want more from them.

1032
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:04,790
Show them your pure joy
of the game.

1033
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:07,793
Bury the attitude a bit,
and show them--

1034
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:09,420
Wait.

1035
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:13,591
- You're telling me to dance.
- No. I'm saying...

1036
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,304
...to get back to the guy
who first started playing. Remember?

1037
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:23,392
Way back when you were a kid,
it wasn't just about the money, was it?

1038
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:25,686
Was it?

1039
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:27,938
Was it?

1040
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:33,652
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance!

1041
01:08:33,903 --> 01:08:35,196
- Fine.
- Hey. Hey!

1042
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:37,615
- Fine!
- I am an athlete.

1043
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:40,326
- I am not an entertainer!
- Fine!

1044
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:42,119
These are the ABC's of me, baby.

1045
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,915
I do not dance, and I do not start
preseason without a contract!

1046
01:08:46,457 --> 01:08:50,127
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

1047
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,048
Breathe! Breathe, Jerry.

1048
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,969
I am out here for you.

1049
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:02,890
You don't know what it's like
to be me out here for you.

1050
01:09:03,057 --> 01:09:07,186
It is an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege...

1051
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:11,148
...that I will never fully
tell you about, okay?!

1052
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:15,945
God. Help me!

1053
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:20,115
Help me, Rod.
Help me help you.

1054
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,079
Help me help you.

1055
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,666
Help me help you.

1056
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,216
I'm sorry.

1057
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:42,471
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

1058
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,558
And I dig that about you!

1059
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:51,647
No contract? I'll help me,
I'll help you, help everybody!

1060
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:56,610
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

1061
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:59,071
Help me! Help me!

1062
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:05,244
- See you in Los Angeles.
- Jerry. Come on, man.

1063
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:08,247
Hey. See, that's the difference
between us.

1064
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:12,209
You think we're fighting.
And I think we're finally talking.

1065
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:21,051
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

1066
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:35,941
Dennis Wilburn is faxing in the new offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

1067
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,945
- He said you'd be happy-- Glad.
- Did he say happy or glad?

1068
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:44,325
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

1069
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,244
- Glad is good. Glad is good.
- Yeah.

1070
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:50,205
- Glad's good.
- We could sure use that commission.

1071
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:54,376
Here. I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

1072
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,715
I spent most of what
I had in this condo.

1073
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:02,551
- You don't have to explain.
- Devalued and....

1074
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:06,805
Look, the other night....
Uh, I wanna apologize.

1075
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:09,016
Yeah. What happened there?

1076
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:12,478
We're coworkers.
We can't have atmosphere.

1077
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:15,105
Mm. No. I'm really relieved
that you said that.

1078
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:18,651
You know, the other night,
I was lonely.

1079
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:21,153
I felt you understood something.

1080
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:25,032
- But we've got a company to think about.
- Yes.

1081
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,243
I will never take advantage
of you in that way again.

1082
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,204
- Good.
- You walked out on a job for me.

1083
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:34,083
This is how I repay you--
Can this be right?

1084
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:36,251
Exactly.

1085
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:41,590
I know this is one of those times when
you need to be alone with your thoughts.

1086
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:44,885
Think about everything that's gone wrong
and how to fix it.

1087
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,763
And, you know, just be alone.

1088
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,057
Alone. Alone, alone, alone.

1089
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:53,936
Alone.

1090
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:59,775
- You wanna go out to dinner?
- I know a great place.

1091
01:11:59,942 --> 01:12:04,488
The guy's a loser so I broke up with him,
and then he started stalking me.

1092
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:07,700
- What is her definition of stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

1093
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:13,163
"Coming over uninvited"?
So Romeo on your balcony is a stalker?

1094
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,915
- Exactly.
- Oh, stop.

1095
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:28,595
Excuse me. Ladies?
Ladies? Hi.

1096
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:33,434
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

1097
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:36,103
She's in the kitchen.

1098
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,106
- Laurel. Hello.
- Jerry, hi.

1099
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:44,445
- Where are you taking her tonight, huh?
- You're the nanny?

1100
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,823
- Au pair.
- Au pair? I see.

1101
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:50,159
- Yeah.
- Jerry!

1102
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,411
Whoa. Hey. Hey.

1103
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:54,663
He likes you.

1104
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,376
My goodness. Look, look.
Ray, I've got some gifts for you.

1105
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:01,837
- Do you like presents?
- Yeah, yeah.

1106
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:03,881
Good, all right.

1107
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,594
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

1108
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:12,306
- Dropping your laundry off?
- Want a Steelers hat?

1109
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:15,059
- For me? Wow.
- I got some things.

1110
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,770
- I've got it in gray too.
- Thanks, Jerry.

1111
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,732
You're very welcome. Oh,
my goodness. Look what I've got here.

1112
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:25,194
This is an energy bar.
This will keep you up all night.

1113
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,698
See, that's not a good idea.
I'll take that. Aunt Laurel will eat that.

1114
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:35,370
Hey. It looks like you've got a fan.

1115
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:41,627
Wow. That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

1116
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:46,048
Yeah. I guess I got a little revved up
at the idea of an evening among adults.

1117
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:49,134
- No offense, buddy.
- Jerry, you meet Chad? Chad, Jerry.

1118
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:52,179
Yeah, we did. Am I dressed okay?
I didn't realize--

1119
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:59,436
Hey, listen, Chad.
Don't let him stay up too late.

1120
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:04,108
Tonight, I'm going to teach Ray here
about jazz.

1121
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:06,527
Good. That'll put him to sleep early.
Heh.

1122
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,114
I want to go too.

1123
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,619
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, you stay here
with Chad and be good. Give me a kiss.

1124
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:20,374
- Let's go. Seriously, let's go. Let's go.
- Hm? Okay.

1125
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,126
- Good night.
- Good night.

1126
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:24,378
Give me a hug.

1127
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,960
Hey.

1128
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:09,631
- Go ahead, I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay.

1129
01:15:09,882 --> 01:15:11,925
You just forgot the keys, no big deal.

1130
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:16,346
That is the first time I have ever seen him
kiss a man just like a dad!

1131
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,473
- Wasn't that thrilling?
- Yeah, it was.

1132
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,226
- He must have been needing that.
- Take it easy.

1133
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:24,479
Don't cry at the beginning of a date.
Cry at the end, like I do.

1134
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:26,899
- You all right? All right.
- Okay, okay.

1135
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,277
And don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on either.

1136
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:33,155
- Keys.
- Oh, keys.

1137
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:36,325
Oh, dear.

1138
01:16:01,934 --> 01:16:05,062
Ever since you've met me,
I've been--

1139
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:15,113
It was laziness, my breakup
with Avery. You know that saying?

1140
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,993
"It's nobody's fault." It's a lie.
Somebody is always to blame.

1141
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,206
You go for it like you do a job.
You work at it.

1142
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:28,585
But maybe love shouldn't be
such hard work.

1143
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:32,005
Yeah, maybe so.

1144
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:38,053
But it's not every day you say goodbye
to a woman like that.

1145
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:43,600
- A song for the lovers?
- No. No, thank you.

1146
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:49,189
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

1147
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:52,025
But I know what you mean.

1148
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:57,864
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before....

1149
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:02,244
Before?

1150
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,540
- Jerry?
- What?

1151
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:10,585
Let's not tell our sad stories.

1152
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:18,760
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

1153
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:51,877
They sting.
Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.

1154
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:57,132
He won't hurt him. You've got such
a good heart, buddy. I love you.

1155
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,789
Well, this would be good night.

1156
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:30,874
Good night.

1157
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,335
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1158
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:34,628
- It's a big day.
- Mm-hm.

1159
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,072
Well, good night.

1160
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,283
Good night.

1161
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:38,483
Oops.

1162
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:46,992
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

1163
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:44,132
I think you should not come in.

1164
01:20:45,675 --> 01:20:48,303
Or come in.

1165
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:55,227
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

1166
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,978
No.

1167
01:20:58,188 --> 01:21:00,398
I have to go in.

1168
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,735
I live here.

1169
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:13,161
Right.

1170
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,376
I'll come in.

1171
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:23,338
Good.

1172
01:21:32,264 --> 01:21:35,016
Are you sure we want to do this?

1173
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:41,064
- Oh, hell, yes.
- Yeah.

1174
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:46,069
- Hey.
- Hi.

1175
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,285
- How is he? Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

1176
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:56,371
- Good.
- How'd it go with sport-boy?

1177
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:58,373
Still going.

1178
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,002
- All right.
- Heh, heh.

1179
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:08,592
Chad. How are you?

1180
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:12,721
Treat her right.

1181
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,181
- Yeah, uh....
- She's....

1182
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:19,728
- She's great.
- Yeah.

1183
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:22,731
And, uh....

1184
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,737
I know this might be a bit awkward,
but I want you to use this.

1185
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:32,741
No, look. God.... Chad. No, no.

1186
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:37,912
This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

1187
01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:40,999
Stockholm 1963.

1188
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:46,129
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted...

1189
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:49,215
...by a zillion cocktail-lounge performers...

1190
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:54,804
...who destroyed the legacy
of the only American art form:

1191
01:22:56,598 --> 01:22:58,391
Jazz.

1192
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:02,604
I've put some Mingus on there too.

1193
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:15,408
- No barriers, no boundaries.
- Chad, I got it.

1194
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:50,151
Come here.

1195
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:12,257
You know this is gonna
change everything.

1196
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,053
Promise?

1197
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:25,520
What is this music?

1198
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:03,725
I love getting up in the morning!
I clap my hands and say:

1199
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:05,685
"This is gonna be a great day!"

1200
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:12,442
Great! Did you really need to do this?

1201
01:25:25,497 --> 01:25:28,166
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

1202
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,128
What? I'm just waiting for coffee.
I don't care.

1203
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:35,423
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

1204
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,053
- Why--?
- I'm worried.

1205
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,096
I'm worried you're putting your faith
in this guy...

1206
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:44,057
...who, because of the way
things are going...

1207
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:45,767
...might not have an emotional marble
in his head.

1208
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:48,603
- Please, if I start talking....
- You "please."

1209
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:52,065
What am I for taking the opportunity?

1210
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:55,193
Men are different people when
they're hanging onto the bottom rung.

1211
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,570
Maybe I am taking advantage.

1212
01:25:57,737 --> 01:26:00,949
Does that make me a bad person? Huh?

1213
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:04,369
Look, all I know is I found
someone popular and charming...

1214
01:26:04,536 --> 01:26:06,538
...and not so nice to me, and he died,
okay?

1215
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,040
So why should I let this guy go? Why?

1216
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:13,962
When everything in my body
says that this one is the one?

1217
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:17,257
Take it easy.
I was just looking for a few fun details.

1218
01:26:17,674 --> 01:26:20,510
Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?

1219
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:24,097
Well, I don't know if you're interested
in this one little detail.

1220
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:26,558
- Yeah, what?
- I was just about to tell you....

1221
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:28,309
Uh-huh?

1222
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,980
That I love him.

1223
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:37,735
I do! I love him, I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

1224
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:40,989
I love him for the man
he wants to be...

1225
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:44,450
...and I love him for the man
that he almost is.

1226
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:47,829
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

1227
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:51,583
- I love him!
- Hi, Jerry.

1228
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:55,795
Act natural.

1229
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:00,341
Hi.

1230
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:04,721
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

1231
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:06,806
Oh, God.

1232
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:10,143
- Easy, ladies, easy.
- Coffee, Jerry?

1233
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,439
Oh, no, thanks. We bottom-feeders
prefer cereal first.

1234
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:20,570
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks? Apple Jacks it is.

1235
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:22,363
Dorothy.

1236
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,949
Good morning, darling.

1237
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:28,870
Morning.

1238
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:31,789
- What's going on, Jerry?
- Well, a lot, actually.

1239
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,835
We've got a big fax today.
We need this commission, buddy.

1240
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,212
Need this commission. Milk?

1241
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:39,839
Yeah.

1242
01:27:40,632 --> 01:27:42,258
Cheers.

1243
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,477
That was really great
of you this morning.

1244
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:58,566
Look, let's just root for a big offer
so we can move out of this room...

1245
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:01,277
...into a real office.

1246
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:04,155
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

1247
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,165
Shit.

1248
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:24,258
1.7 for three years?
Man, we owe more than that!

1249
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:27,387
It's okay. This is how the game
is played. I'll go back to them.

1250
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:30,390
And say what? "Please remove
your dick from my ass"?

1251
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:31,766
- Marcee.
- I'm sorry.

1252
01:28:31,933 --> 01:28:34,936
- I'm just a little pregnant right now.
- That's okay. That's okay.

1253
01:28:35,103 --> 01:28:40,274
- I feel like crying.
- Let's not take this emotionally.

1254
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:44,696
- We're gonna roll with this problem.
- What are you so calm about?

1255
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:48,574
What do you mean, roll with this
problem? Don't take it emotionally?

1256
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,201
You haven't gotten emotional...

1257
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:52,996
- ...enough over this man!
- Well, I disagree.

1258
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:55,289
- Give me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee....

1259
01:28:58,126 --> 01:29:01,212
- You wanna leave me?
- A lot of agents say a lot of shit.

1260
01:29:01,379 --> 01:29:03,715
- So, what do you stand for?
- You wanna leave me?

1261
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:05,174
What do you stand for?!

1262
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:10,555
How about a little piece of integrity?
There's so much greed in the world...

1263
01:29:10,722 --> 01:29:13,725
...I don't know what to tell my son!
Except, "Here.

1264
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:17,270
Have a look at a guy who isn't yelling,
'Show me the money!"'

1265
01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:22,442
You know he's broke? He is broke
and working for you for free.

1266
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:26,738
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

1267
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:31,909
- I'm not as good at the insults as she is.
- No. That was pretty good.

1268
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,037
No shit.

1269
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:37,790
Let me show you something.

1270
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:46,174
- Here. Rod, read this.
- Whoa. No, no, no.

1271
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:50,511
I just think that--
I think it's important.

1272
01:29:50,928 --> 01:29:53,222
I appreciate this, but....

1273
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:56,768
You should be proud of that.
I still think they should read it.

1274
01:29:57,477 --> 01:30:02,732
Tell me what to do. Tell me to
eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1275
01:30:03,858 --> 01:30:06,819
You tell me this is the best we can get,
all we can get--

1276
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:10,406
- All we can get?
- I'm talking with my agent.

1277
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:15,995
This is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna reject that shitty contract.

1278
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:20,833
Play out your existing shitty contract,
and you're a free agent next year.

1279
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,335
Come on, hey, hey.

1280
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:28,049
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

1281
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:30,676
Baby, you are a strong, proud...

1282
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:34,514
...surviving, splendid black man.

1283
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,518
Marcee...

1284
01:30:39,644 --> 01:30:41,813
...you are the shit.

1285
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:46,818
Oh, baby.

1286
01:30:49,362 --> 01:30:53,950
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1287
01:30:54,117 --> 01:30:56,077
- That's right.
- Rod.

1288
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:02,792
- It's a risk.
- You bet on me, like I bet on you.

1289
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,920
Huh?

1290
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:11,676
You know? My man!

1291
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:15,221
- You know?
- Yeah, you know?

1292
01:31:15,388 --> 01:31:17,765
You know, baby?

1293
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:23,104
- Aw, you're so crazy.
- I love you, baby.

1294
01:31:24,438 --> 01:31:27,275
- Let me kiss that head.
- Come on, girl. Thank you, boo.

1295
01:31:27,984 --> 01:31:29,110
Thank you, boo.

1296
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:37,785
I'm taking that job in San Diego.

1297
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:40,621
- Don't even talk about that yet.
- You can't afford me.

1298
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,624
You can't afford me, Jerry.

1299
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,544
I'll find something fast for Tidwell.

1300
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:49,088
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

1301
01:31:50,715 --> 01:31:55,219
We will stay afloat. Don't leave.

1302
01:31:55,386 --> 01:31:57,388
- Get on the camel.
- Been on my ass all day.

1303
01:31:57,555 --> 01:31:59,182
I told you to put the camera low.

1304
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,226
- He's my client.
- Then get him on the camel.

1305
01:32:02,393 --> 01:32:03,978
- I'm gonna.
- We don't need a camel.

1306
01:32:04,145 --> 01:32:05,146
You got Rod Tidwell.

1307
01:32:05,313 --> 01:32:08,482
- It's Camel Chevrolet.
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1308
01:32:09,901 --> 01:32:12,945
- Do you hear him? He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel!

1309
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:18,075
- I'm pulling him from this.
- Not saying that. Just get rid of the camel.

1310
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:21,954
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- You're pulling him?

1311
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:23,998
You're right, let's bounce.

1312
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:29,253
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't
have begged me to hire him.

1313
01:32:30,129 --> 01:32:34,550
I know you needed that commission, but
we won't bring Reebok to their knees...

1314
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:37,553
...with no regional Camel ad.
Excuse me, darling.

1315
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:40,264
Can I ask you a question
unrelated to your career?

1316
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:42,975
What, are we gonna be friends now?

1317
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:45,686
What do you know about
dating a single mother?

1318
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:48,231
Plenty. I was raised by a single mother.

1319
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:53,819
Tell me. Because I think after this,
she'll have to take that job in San Diego.

1320
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:58,324
First of all, single mothers don't date.
They've-- Watch yourself.

1321
01:32:58,491 --> 01:33:03,037
They don't date. They've been to
the circus. You know what I mean? Heh.

1322
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:06,707
They've been to the puppet show
and they've seen the strings.

1323
01:33:06,874 --> 01:33:09,460
- Do you love her?
- How do I know?

1324
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:12,213
What do you mean?
You know when you know.

1325
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:16,217
I'm feeling little-- I don't want her to go.
I've been hanging out at her place a lot.

1326
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:21,305
Wait, wait. That right there, that's bullshit.
You gotta be fair to her.

1327
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:25,977
Single mother, man, that's a sacred thing.
You gotta have the talk.

1328
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:32,817
She loves you. If you don't love her,
you have got to tell her.

1329
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:38,572
The kid's amazing. He....

1330
01:33:41,909 --> 01:33:44,537
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1331
01:33:44,704 --> 01:33:49,292
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pootie from a single mother.

1332
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:53,587
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1333
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:03,306
All right. I shoplifted the pootie.

1334
01:34:12,148 --> 01:34:17,069
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis....

1335
01:34:17,737 --> 01:34:20,323
When you say goodbye to him,
just be cool.

1336
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,867
- Okay.
- What's meant to be will be.

1337
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:26,829
You'll still see each other. I'm losing
the only person that ever listens to me...

1338
01:34:26,996 --> 01:34:28,414
...and you only listen partially.

1339
01:34:28,581 --> 01:34:32,209
- No, no. Quit making me laugh.
- You're doing the right thing.

1340
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:35,671
You need to start your life. He needs
a warm body to cushion the fall.

1341
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:38,799
Check out Exhibit A on the front lawn.
Look at that.

1342
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:40,926
We should hang out.

1343
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,262
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

1344
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:44,805
Goodbye.

1345
01:34:44,972 --> 01:34:46,849
All right. Goodbye.

1346
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:51,479
Bye.

1347
01:34:58,361 --> 01:35:02,073
Listen, you're gonna like it
in San Diego, Ray.

1348
01:35:03,574 --> 01:35:04,617
Ray?

1349
01:35:06,577 --> 01:35:10,873
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

1350
01:35:11,749 --> 01:35:16,253
- I'm gonna see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

1351
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:24,011
Go ahead and go.

1352
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:38,943
- Sure you're okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

1353
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,444
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Okay.

1354
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:44,281
Get in the car. Get in the car, Dorothy.

1355
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:49,120
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I love you.

1356
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,540
I love you too.

1357
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,043
- What?
- Nothing.

1358
01:35:56,544 --> 01:35:58,587
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

1359
01:35:59,547 --> 01:36:04,135
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month...

1360
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:09,723
...and next month turns into whenever,
don't make a joke of your life.

1361
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,060
Go back and read what you wrote.
You're better than the rest of them.

1362
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:18,649
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

1363
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,710
Wait! Wait a second.

1364
01:36:37,877 --> 01:36:39,628
No, no! Oh, God.

1365
01:36:41,589 --> 01:36:46,343
- We can save on medical, rent....
- Don't listen to him.

1366
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:50,306
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

1367
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:57,146
- If I said that, would you stay?
- Don't do that. Don't say that unless--

1368
01:36:57,313 --> 01:37:00,524
Well, say it if you want to.

1369
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,406
Will you marry me?

1370
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,539
What are you thinking?

1371
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:49,490
Laurel!

1372
01:37:50,032 --> 01:37:51,492
We're getting married.

1373
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:52,993
Mm....

1374
01:37:53,494 --> 01:37:58,332
Do you, Jerry Maguire,
take this woman to be your wife?

1375
01:37:58,749 --> 01:37:59,833
Not yet.

1376
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,422
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

1377
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,758
Almost.

1378
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:10,469
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1379
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,180
- Okay, sweetie.
<i>- Aw, yeah.</i>

1380
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:42,751
Get down, Ray!

1381
01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:53,012
I should go.

1382
01:38:56,473 --> 01:38:59,184
Come on, brother.
Come on and talk to me, brother.

1383
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:15,284
We did it.

1384
01:39:16,744 --> 01:39:18,412
We sure did.

1385
01:39:38,223 --> 01:39:40,184
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1386
01:39:47,316 --> 01:39:49,652
I'm glad we had this talk.

1387
01:39:51,737 --> 01:39:53,947
Oh, look at them.

1388
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:59,453
Oh. She is so beautiful.

1389
01:40:15,302 --> 01:40:18,639
I do not believe they have this on tape.

1390
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:22,184
Hey, that's my bro.

1391
01:40:25,396 --> 01:40:28,107
See, now I'm gonna release this
to ESPN.

1392
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:35,406
- You think I'm joking.
- No, it's all right. I know where you live.

1393
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:41,870
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1394
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:43,664
Hm?

1395
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:45,749
No.

1396
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:50,337
Well, this definitely
was another way to go. Ha-ha-ha.

1397
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,259
Hey, hey. Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1398
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:59,263
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Maguire. Ha-ha-ha.

1399
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:01,432
- Yay! Yay!
- We're gonna have a great season!

1400
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:02,599
Woo-hoo!

1401
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:13,610
Scotty, Tidwell did four for 36.

1402
01:41:13,777 --> 01:41:15,696
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Tom.

1403
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:18,657
- Jerry.
- Dennis.

1404
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:21,285
- He's having a good game. So far.
- You bet he is.

1405
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:23,954
You're gonna miss him next year.

1406
01:41:24,121 --> 01:41:27,082
<i>Loser.</i>

1407
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:33,380
<i>I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it. I'm loving life.</i>

1408
01:41:40,179 --> 01:41:41,889
That's my mo'fo!

1409
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,391
Uh-uh. Come here.

1410
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:51,356
Come here. Why don't you be the first
man in your family not to use that word?

1411
01:41:51,607 --> 01:41:55,611
And then we'll let you live.
Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1412
01:41:58,739 --> 01:41:59,740
Come on, now!

1413
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:02,910
Come on, Rod!

1414
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:08,874
Now, I saw you limping a little bit
after the first quarter.

1415
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,584
Yeah, I--

1416
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:17,257
I sprained my ankle on the ice out there.
It was cold. Twisted my ankle.

1417
01:42:17,424 --> 01:42:19,259
All right. Thanks.

1418
01:42:19,426 --> 01:42:24,181
Okay, that went well.
Anybody else here worth talking to? No.

1419
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:26,099
All right, let's get out of here.

1420
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,437
- How's your head?
- Bubblicious.

1421
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:31,605
- Can you sign?
- Hey.

1422
01:42:31,772 --> 01:42:33,941
- How are you?
- Hey, Rod.

1423
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:38,487
- How you doing, man?
- Hanging in there. Good game.

1424
01:42:40,656 --> 01:42:45,035
That quarterback sucks, man.
He's gonna get me killed.

1425
01:42:45,202 --> 01:42:48,747
He's throwing high
and across the middle. I'm worried.

1426
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:52,751
I'm worried I'm getting my brains blown
because you weren't asshole enough...

1427
01:42:52,918 --> 01:42:57,089
...to get me my 10 million
three fucking months ago. Shit.

1428
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:03,011
You take care of yourself out on that field,
you hear? You're my entire client roster.

1429
01:43:03,178 --> 01:43:07,391
Don't I know this?
Now go home to your wife.

1430
01:43:07,641 --> 01:43:10,602
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you doing here?

1431
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:15,315
- You could've told me on the phone.
- How about dedication, personal attention?

1432
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:18,902
- You don't want to go home, do you?
- What are you saying?

1433
01:43:19,152 --> 01:43:23,532
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage, Jerry?

1434
01:43:23,699 --> 01:43:26,743
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

1435
01:43:28,954 --> 01:43:30,664
Huh?

1436
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:38,839
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Then why did you get married?

1437
01:43:39,673 --> 01:43:43,677
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

1438
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:45,512
Loyalty.

1439
01:43:46,597 --> 01:43:48,223
She was loyal.

1440
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:57,190
I mean, you know,
everything grew from there.

1441
01:43:57,608 --> 01:43:59,526
It just...

1442
01:44:00,569 --> 01:44:02,195
...grew from there.

1443
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:07,618
- That's an answer.
- That's the answer.

1444
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:12,706
It's not sexy. Shit!
But that's an answer.

1445
01:44:12,873 --> 01:44:16,293
"Tell him what he's won, Bob."
"A beautiful marriage!"

1446
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,546
Shit!

1447
01:44:19,713 --> 01:44:24,509
Well, I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

1448
01:44:26,053 --> 01:44:29,973
- Shit.
- I-- I have a question for you, Rod.

1449
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:32,225
- Are we really friends?
- Why not?

1450
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:37,189
Friends can tell each other anything
if we have our "friends hats" on, right?

1451
01:44:37,356 --> 01:44:39,274
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right.

1452
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:43,028
I'll tell you why you don't have
your $10 million yet.

1453
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:48,825
Right now. You are a paycheck player.
You play with your head, not your heart.

1454
01:44:48,992 --> 01:44:51,328
In your personal life? Heart.

1455
01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:54,873
But when you get on the field,
it's all about what you didn't get...

1456
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:57,501
...who's to blame,
who underthrew the pass...

1457
01:44:57,751 --> 01:45:01,964
...who's got the contract you don't,
who's not giving you your love!

1458
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:07,177
That is not what inspires people.
That is not what inspires people!

1459
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:11,431
Just shut up. Play the game, play it
from your heart. And you know what?

1460
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:15,936
I will show you the kwan. And that's
the truth, man! That's the truth.

1461
01:45:16,103 --> 01:45:18,939
Can you handle it?
It's just a question between friends.

1462
01:45:19,106 --> 01:45:21,024
You know?

1463
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:26,738
Oh. When they call
you shrimp, I'm the one who defends you!

1464
01:45:27,197 --> 01:45:29,825
- I don't wanna be friends no more.
- Fine.

1465
01:45:29,992 --> 01:45:33,662
Quit using that word "kwan."
That's my word!

1466
01:45:33,829 --> 01:45:36,498
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart. No heart?!

1467
01:45:37,624 --> 01:45:40,419
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1468
01:46:18,165 --> 01:46:19,708
How many concussions has he had?

1469
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:23,253
But he keeps a brother--
I ain't get no respect. This is bullshit.

1470
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,088
I'm making miracles happen.

1471
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:47,819
Oh, you guys. I go to see this
so-called black film the other day, okay?

1472
01:46:48,278 --> 01:46:51,573
Honey, no more salt for you.
Your biggest game is coming up.

1473
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:55,494
I don't want you dehydrated
for <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

1474
01:46:57,913 --> 01:47:02,959
Anyway, 20 minutes of coming
attractions. All black films, all violent.

1475
01:47:03,126 --> 01:47:07,798
- Brothers shooting brothers.
- I hate you going to the movies alone.

1476
01:47:07,964 --> 01:47:11,885
- Oh, baby.
- My Pisces queen.

1477
01:47:12,052 --> 01:47:14,221
Oh, baby.

1478
01:47:15,388 --> 01:47:19,476
- I hate seeing movies without you.
- Heh-heh-heh.

1479
01:47:20,811 --> 01:47:23,271
- I won't do it anymore, okay?
- Okay.

1480
01:47:23,438 --> 01:47:25,649
- I promise.
- Okay.

1481
01:47:27,651 --> 01:47:29,903
- Ooh, ooh, another one.
- Mm-hm.

1482
01:47:30,487 --> 01:47:31,488
Chee-chee bear.

1483
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:35,033
- Baby.
- Baby!

1484
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,910
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, baby.

1485
01:47:37,077 --> 01:47:38,453
- Baby.
- Oh, baby!

1486
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:41,248
- Now?
- Baby, baby, baby now!

1487
01:47:41,414 --> 01:47:42,749
Baby.

1488
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:46,044
- Ray, it's time to go.
- Come on.

1489
01:47:46,211 --> 01:47:49,923
- You got them?
- Hey, you take Visa? Take it!

1490
01:47:51,299 --> 01:47:53,593
What were you thinking tonight...

1491
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,723
...watching them go through the entire
human emotional experience?

1492
01:47:58,974 --> 01:48:01,935
I was thinking,
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

1493
01:48:04,146 --> 01:48:05,897
I felt responsible.

1494
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:12,237
Sometimes I can't tell at all
what's going on in your head.

1495
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:17,117
Ah....

1496
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,621
And I really don't know your noises yet.

1497
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:27,878
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.
- Okay, I will.

1498
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:31,464
- I thought I just did.
- Heh.

1499
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:39,431
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

1500
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,601
Jerry, can I come in and watch TV?

1501
01:48:42,976 --> 01:48:45,604
- In just a minute.
- Just for a few minutes, buddy.

1502
01:48:48,148 --> 01:48:49,983
Oh....

1503
01:49:04,998 --> 01:49:07,083
<i>Hang in there.
He's not going anywhere.</i>

1504
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:09,169
I know.

1505
01:49:09,836 --> 01:49:13,590
- Can we talk about something else?
- I don't think so.

1506
01:49:13,757 --> 01:49:18,762
I'm incapable of small talk.
But that's why you love me, right?

1507
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:35,695
I'm about personal attention.
This is my life.

1508
01:49:35,946 --> 01:49:38,615
I'm available to you
24 hours a day.

1509
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:42,869
Call me anytime. I'll be in Phoenix
tomorrow for <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

1510
01:49:43,036 --> 01:49:46,623
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1511
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,792
Just give me 20 minutes.

1512
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:52,379
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1513
01:49:52,545 --> 01:49:56,716
I'll call you tomorrow. Just enjoy your day.
Tell Douglas hello, would you please?

1514
01:49:57,217 --> 01:50:00,553
All right, thank you.
Same to you, Marilee. Bye-bye.

1515
01:50:03,848 --> 01:50:07,560
Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.

1516
01:50:11,773 --> 01:50:13,066
It's my fault.

1517
01:50:15,318 --> 01:50:16,319
What?

1518
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:20,073
It's not fair to you, this whole thing.

1519
01:50:23,785 --> 01:50:25,078
Come here.

1520
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:29,249
Tell me. Let me help.

1521
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:33,628
I took advantage of you.
And the worst of it is I'm not alone.

1522
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:36,339
I did this with a kid.

1523
01:50:36,589 --> 01:50:41,678
I was just on some wild ride
where I thought that....

1524
01:50:41,928 --> 01:50:46,599
That I was in love enough
for both of us.

1525
01:50:47,851 --> 01:50:50,645
I pretended that proposal by the car
was real...

1526
01:50:50,812 --> 01:50:54,107
...and it might have
just been a hypothetical.

1527
01:50:56,651 --> 01:50:58,653
I did this.

1528
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:02,407
And at least I can do something
about it now.

1529
01:51:03,283 --> 01:51:05,994
I'm not a guy who runs.

1530
01:51:06,244 --> 01:51:08,038
I stick.

1531
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:13,251
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1532
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:16,963
What do you want?
My soul or something?

1533
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:22,969
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

1534
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:28,892
- I think we made a mistake.
- No, listen, what if it's true?

1535
01:51:31,227 --> 01:51:34,606
"Great at friendship, bad at intimacy."

1536
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:38,777
It's the theme of my bachelor film,
for God's sake.

1537
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:43,740
I know, I watched it.
I sort of know it by heart.

1538
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:52,040
- I don't like to give up.
- Please, Jerry.

1539
01:51:52,207 --> 01:51:57,295
My need to make the best of things
and your need to be responsible....

1540
01:51:57,462 --> 01:52:02,300
If one of us doesn't say something
about it now, we could lose 10 years...

1541
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:04,344
...being polite.

1542
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:11,017
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1543
01:52:12,227 --> 01:52:13,728
A nice long break.

1544
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:24,072
What about Ray?

1545
01:52:28,701 --> 01:52:30,537
Well, you'll be friends.

1546
01:52:32,372 --> 01:52:34,707
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends.

1547
01:52:38,545 --> 01:52:42,966
- Of course you'll be friends.
- I'll take him to the zoo.

1548
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:50,306
So this break is a breakup?
That's--

1549
01:52:50,473 --> 01:52:55,019
Come on, Jerry.
You know this isn't easy for me.

1550
01:52:55,687 --> 01:52:58,773
On the surface, everything looks fine.

1551
01:52:59,649 --> 01:53:02,735
I've got this great guy.

1552
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:06,489
And he loves my kid.

1553
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:11,744
And he sure does like me a lot.

1554
01:53:18,334 --> 01:53:21,087
And I can't live like that.

1555
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:26,926
It's not how I'm built.

1556
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:04,297
If this is empty, this doesn't matter.

1557
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:28,863
It was just a mission statement.

1558
01:54:44,879 --> 01:54:48,925
Put your arms up, please. All right.

1559
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:05,066
Hey, Rod, buddy. I was wondering
where you were. How's it going?

1560
01:55:05,358 --> 01:55:07,235
Get out of here. Go.

1561
01:55:09,904 --> 01:55:13,283
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1562
01:55:13,866 --> 01:55:18,329
Rod, you belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1563
01:55:18,496 --> 01:55:22,417
- Hey! Hey. Get away from my guy.
- You're fucking Rod Tidwell!

1564
01:55:22,584 --> 01:55:27,547
- Hey, Jerry, I was just telling--
- Just go. Flee.

1565
01:55:27,714 --> 01:55:32,051
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1566
01:55:34,178 --> 01:55:36,514
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1567
01:55:44,981 --> 01:55:47,817
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1568
01:55:50,445 --> 01:55:54,157
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1569
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:59,287
Frank Gifford
with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.

1570
01:55:59,454 --> 01:56:01,956
Welcome to Tempe, Arizona,
Sun Devil Stadium.

1571
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:06,669
<i>The story tonight is the Cardinals.
They are still alive for a playoff spot.</i>

1572
01:56:06,919 --> 01:56:08,254
<i>The reason for that...</i>

1573
01:56:08,421 --> 01:56:12,634
<i>...is the outstanding play of Rod Tidwell.
We'll talk about that too.</i>

1574
01:56:14,135 --> 01:56:17,805
The Dallas Cowboys continue to roll,
they know they're in the playoffs.

1575
01:56:17,972 --> 01:56:21,017
<i>Going for a second consecutive
Super Bowl.</i>

1576
01:56:21,434 --> 01:56:24,771
Here's the deal. If Arizona
wins tonight and next week...

1577
01:56:24,937 --> 01:56:29,525
<i>...the Cardinals will make the playoffs
for the first time in 21 years.</i>

1578
01:56:29,692 --> 01:56:30,943
Whoo!

1579
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,781
Better not mess up
for <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

1580
01:56:35,323 --> 01:56:39,577
What? Everybody knows he gets
nervous for nationally televised games.

1581
01:56:39,744 --> 01:56:44,540
<i>The Cowboys continue
their mission on</i> Monday Night Football.

1582
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:53,758
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, Jerry, good game.

1583
01:56:53,925 --> 01:56:57,762
- Yeah. Hey, great column this morning.
- Thanks.

1584
01:57:03,184 --> 01:57:04,560
Fuck you, punk!

1585
01:57:11,818 --> 01:57:14,237
Boy, guys, it's a real bruiser
out there tonight.

1586
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:17,365
<i>The Cardinals refuse to go quietly...</i>

1587
01:57:17,532 --> 01:57:18,700
<i>...into the desert night...</i>

1588
01:57:18,866 --> 01:57:23,746
...as their seemingly interminable season
winds down. I'm just trying to be poetic.

1589
01:57:23,913 --> 01:57:25,456
<i>Wax on, Al. Wax on.</i>

1590
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:30,086
<i>- Ouch!</i>
<i>- A tough hit on Tidwell.</i>

1591
01:57:30,253 --> 01:57:31,671
Nothing poetic about that.

1592
01:57:31,838 --> 01:57:33,923
I would have taken it for the touchdown.

1593
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:36,426
<i>That's his sixth catch of the night.</i>

1594
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:39,470
<i>Split to the right.
Swenson looks that way.</i>

1595
01:57:39,637 --> 01:57:42,265
<i>Enough for a first down
at the 19-yard line.</i>

1596
01:57:42,432 --> 01:57:47,228
<i>Another savage hit
across the middle on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1597
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,939
<i>They are working Tidwell, aren't they?</i>

1598
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:54,902
- Hey. What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it really is.

1599
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:56,279
That's right.

1600
01:57:56,529 --> 01:57:59,031
He ain't gonna have
nothing left. He'll kill himself.

1601
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:01,200
- Can you be quiet?
- What did I say?

1602
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:04,746
Less than two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1603
01:58:04,912 --> 01:58:09,459
<i>Second down and one now
at the Dallas 1 1-yard line.</i>

1604
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:13,129
<i>Swenson backs to pass. A blitz!</i>

1605
01:58:13,296 --> 01:58:15,673
<i>And down he goes!
He's sacked for a six-yard loss.</i>

1606
01:58:16,215 --> 01:58:18,926
<i>Good move
coming with the blitz after Swenson.</i>

1607
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:21,262
<i>He had too many men in that pattern.</i>

1608
01:58:21,429 --> 01:58:24,682
<i>They just did not have enough
to pick up the blitz.</i>

1609
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:29,729
90 razor, X-out on one, ready?

1610
01:58:29,896 --> 01:58:30,897
Break!

1611
01:58:31,355 --> 01:58:33,149
All right. Here we go, here we go!

1612
01:58:33,316 --> 01:58:36,319
<i>He had a chance
to get rid of it. Had to tuck it away.</i>

1613
01:58:36,486 --> 01:58:39,822
<i>From second and one,
they've now gone to third and seven.</i>

1614
01:58:40,072 --> 01:58:45,077
<i>In the waning moments of this game,
Dallas 1 7, Arizona 14.</i>

1615
01:58:45,578 --> 01:58:49,457
<i>Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left now.</i>

1616
01:58:49,624 --> 01:58:54,545
<i>Play fake. Swenson, protected well,
lofts one to the end zone.</i>

1617
01:58:54,712 --> 01:58:57,298
<i>Tidwell! Touchdown, Cardinals!</i>

1618
01:58:57,465 --> 01:58:59,467
<i>Did you see him go up on that ball?</i>

1619
01:58:59,634 --> 01:59:01,219
<i>He held onto the football.</i>

1620
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:06,057
<i>He's still down on the ground. Tidwell,
upside down, hits the ground hard.</i>

1621
01:59:06,224 --> 01:59:10,728
<i>- He maintains control of the football.</i>
<i>- He's hurt too.</i>

1622
01:59:10,895 --> 01:59:15,566
<i>He's not getting up. Look
at the faces of these Cardinals' players.</i>

1623
01:59:16,025 --> 01:59:17,693
Oh, my God. Get up, baby.

1624
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:22,490
<i>The trainer comes
racing out. It's Tidwell's ninth catch.</i>

1625
01:59:22,657 --> 01:59:23,950
Oh, my God.

1626
01:59:24,116 --> 01:59:26,244
<i>He gives Arizona the lead.</i>

1627
01:59:27,537 --> 01:59:28,913
Hey!

1628
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:33,584
Hey, hey, hey!

1629
01:59:34,377 --> 01:59:38,339
- Can you hear me?
- Blink! Come on, blink!

1630
01:59:45,847 --> 01:59:49,392
Why are they cutting to a commercial?
Show me what's wrong with my husband.

1631
01:59:49,642 --> 01:59:52,812
- Told you he was too small for the NFL.
- Shut up.

1632
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:56,983
- I'm telling the truth. I'm keeping it real!
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1633
01:59:58,317 --> 02:00:03,364
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house! Get out!

1634
02:00:04,073 --> 02:00:07,451
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

1635
02:00:08,452 --> 02:00:09,829
Punk!

1636
02:00:12,164 --> 02:00:15,501
Jerry? Oh, my God, Jerry,
I am freaking out.

1637
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:18,254
- Marcee, he's unconscious.
<i>- Jerry, Jerry.</i>

1638
02:00:18,421 --> 02:00:23,175
No, I know. Just stay calm. Keep
the lines open, I will call you back.

1639
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:26,053
There's good doctors on the field.
Just stay calm.

1640
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:30,057
You have to tell me something.
I am freaking here.

1641
02:00:30,224 --> 02:00:34,854
Please, we gotta stay calm.
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1642
02:00:35,354 --> 02:00:39,358
I know, but my whole life
is this family...

1643
02:00:39,525 --> 02:00:42,570
...and it does not work without him!

1644
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:46,741
<i>All eyes at Sun Devil Stadium...</i>

1645
02:00:46,908 --> 02:00:48,743
<i>...are focused on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1646
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:51,787
I am so sorry about
everything I said about your job.

1647
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:55,750
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me, please.

1648
02:00:55,917 --> 02:01:00,212
Just do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

1649
02:01:00,755 --> 02:01:02,590
<i>At a time like this...</i>

1650
02:01:02,757 --> 02:01:05,718
<i>...you just hope his family
is not watching this.</i>

1651
02:01:06,844 --> 02:01:10,097
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1652
02:01:14,101 --> 02:01:17,229
Blink, baby!
Come on, wake up!

1653
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:21,484
We love you, Rod!

1654
02:01:30,076 --> 02:01:33,245
Rod? Rod? Can you hear me?

1655
02:01:33,871 --> 02:01:35,623
Can you hear me?

1656
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:38,334
Do you know where you are?

1657
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:41,504
<i>The trainer's still trying to revive Rod.</i>

1658
02:01:41,671 --> 02:01:44,006
You'd love to see some movement.

1659
02:01:44,256 --> 02:01:47,510
- Rod?
- Let's get him off the field.

1660
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,303
- No.
- Get the gurney.

1661
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:50,888
Let's get him off the field now.

1662
02:01:51,055 --> 02:01:55,810
No, wait, wait. Just let me
enjoy this for a minute.

1663
02:01:55,977 --> 02:01:58,980
<i>You're looking for any movement.</i>

1664
02:01:59,146 --> 02:02:00,398
<i>Is that his head coming up?</i>

1665
02:02:01,107 --> 02:02:03,150
<i>He's gonna try to get up.</i>

1666
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,404
<i>And he is getting up.</i>

1667
02:02:14,954 --> 02:02:18,040
Oh, my God. Look at him!
Mommy, he's okay.

1668
02:02:20,209 --> 02:02:21,544
Oh, my God!

1669
02:02:22,044 --> 02:02:24,964
<i>Everybody's
standing at Sun Devil Stadium.</i>

1670
02:02:25,131 --> 02:02:27,800
He's up on his feet
and the crowd loves it.

1671
02:02:46,777 --> 02:02:48,320
Whoo!

1672
02:02:56,203 --> 02:03:01,625
Here's a guy who's has been very
truculent with the media, standoffish....

1673
02:03:17,058 --> 02:03:20,311
<i>- We're happy for you.</i>
<i>- He'll get a flag on this.</i>

1674
02:03:20,478 --> 02:03:22,646
<i>Who cares!</i>

1675
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:41,165
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Hell of a game.

1676
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,085
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1677
02:03:47,088 --> 02:03:50,257
Jerry. Jerry. Maguire!

1678
02:03:52,218 --> 02:03:54,553
<i>You are gonna pay.</i>

1679
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:57,431
I know. I know.

1680
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:04,105
It's Tidwell. Come on.

1681
02:04:17,326 --> 02:04:19,328
Where's Jerry?

1682
02:04:39,223 --> 02:04:41,016
You did it.

1683
02:04:41,433 --> 02:04:43,102
You did.

1684
02:04:44,812 --> 02:04:47,940
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1685
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:52,695
Psh.

1686
02:04:56,824 --> 02:04:59,160
Is that your porty or mine?

1687
02:05:02,371 --> 02:05:03,956
Dorothy?

1688
02:05:05,207 --> 02:05:08,335
Marcee. No, no, no, he's right here.
He's right here.

1689
02:05:08,586 --> 02:05:12,298
It's Marcee. She couldn't
get through on your phone.

1690
02:05:14,675 --> 02:05:19,221
We did it. I love you.
I love you so much!

1691
02:05:20,764 --> 02:05:21,765
Oh! Yeah.

1692
02:05:23,642 --> 02:05:25,644
I love you!

1693
02:05:27,897 --> 02:05:29,815
Whoo!

1694
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:34,111
I love you, Tyson.
I love you, baby.

1695
02:05:34,278 --> 02:05:36,906
How's the baby?
How's Katie?

1696
02:05:37,615 --> 02:05:39,450
Oh, I love you so much.

1697
02:05:42,036 --> 02:05:45,247
No, I'm okay. You know
ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

1698
02:05:53,631 --> 02:05:58,093
The problem is, Alice, you were
saying earlier, the biorhythms.

1699
02:06:00,054 --> 02:06:03,224
I was saying
the neural pathways are set.

1700
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:05,392
And that's why it's hard
for people to change.

1701
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:07,937
That's why behavior
doesn't change very often.

1702
02:06:11,899 --> 02:06:16,570
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
make me feel more divorced.

1703
02:06:17,029 --> 02:06:21,742
You know? With the songs,
the constant chocolate-eating....

1704
02:06:37,758 --> 02:06:40,719
I have a confession to make.

1705
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:46,141
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob stories.

1706
02:06:46,308 --> 02:06:48,727
I've been very judgmental.

1707
02:06:48,894 --> 02:06:53,232
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1708
02:06:53,399 --> 02:06:56,986
No, they're not the enemy.

1709
02:06:57,236 --> 02:06:59,947
But I still love the enemy.

1710
02:07:14,461 --> 02:07:16,714
Hello. Hello.

1711
02:07:18,215 --> 02:07:19,925
I'm looking for my wife.

1712
02:07:33,105 --> 02:07:34,273
Wait.

1713
02:07:35,774 --> 02:07:37,901
Okay, okay.

1714
02:07:41,822 --> 02:07:43,407
Okay.

1715
02:07:44,616 --> 02:07:49,121
If this is where it has to happen,
then this is where it has to happen.

1716
02:07:50,247 --> 02:07:54,251
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1717
02:08:00,758 --> 02:08:04,970
This used to be my specialty. I was good
in a living room. They'd send me in there...

1718
02:08:05,137 --> 02:08:06,764
...I'd do it alone.

1719
02:08:07,556 --> 02:08:09,558
And now, I just....

1720
02:08:15,647 --> 02:08:17,066
I don't know.

1721
02:08:22,571 --> 02:08:24,365
But tonight...

1722
02:08:25,282 --> 02:08:30,662
...our little project, our company
had a very big night.

1723
02:08:31,163 --> 02:08:35,417
A very, very big night.

1724
02:08:38,379 --> 02:08:40,422
But it wasn't complete.

1725
02:08:42,925 --> 02:08:48,555
It wasn't nearly close to being
in the same vicinity as complete...

1726
02:08:49,014 --> 02:08:50,891
...because I couldn't share it with you.

1727
02:08:53,018 --> 02:08:55,062
I couldn't hear your voice...

1728
02:08:57,398 --> 02:09:00,025
...or laugh about it with you.

1729
02:09:02,403 --> 02:09:05,572
I missed my-- I missed my wife.

1730
02:09:21,922 --> 02:09:27,136
We live in a cynical world.
A cynical world.

1731
02:09:27,636 --> 02:09:31,640
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1732
02:09:42,025 --> 02:09:43,819
I love you.

1733
02:09:44,069 --> 02:09:45,487
You...

1734
02:09:47,239 --> 02:09:49,032
...complete me.

1735
02:09:50,451 --> 02:09:51,452
And I just--

1736
02:09:51,618 --> 02:09:53,745
Shut up.

1737
02:09:53,912 --> 02:09:55,497
Just shut up.

1738
02:09:56,248 --> 02:09:58,417
You had me at "hello."

1739
02:09:59,626 --> 02:10:01,962
You had me at "hello."

1740
02:10:14,558 --> 02:10:17,311
You know this is the best
talking group I've ever been in.

1741
02:10:17,478 --> 02:10:22,232
Your father leaves home on Christmas
Eve, leaves your family all alone.

1742
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:26,862
Your mother had to sweep at a prison
to earn enough money for your tuition.

1743
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:30,699
Your brother loses a leg
in a tragic bass-fishing accident.

1744
02:10:30,866 --> 02:10:34,995
There's been a horrific list of things
that have happened to you in your life.

1745
02:10:35,162 --> 02:10:38,874
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- Ha-ha-ha. We have some good news.

1746
02:10:39,041 --> 02:10:41,960
This has just been handed to me.
A memo, it's signed.

1747
02:10:42,127 --> 02:10:46,381
It's a contract, guaranteed.
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

1748
02:10:46,548 --> 02:10:51,720
$11.2 million. You're gonna get to play
in Arizona, where it all started.

1749
02:10:51,887 --> 02:10:53,847
What do you think of that?

1750
02:10:59,978 --> 02:11:01,355
Oh, my God.

1751
02:11:10,322 --> 02:11:12,574
Whoo! Whoo!

1752
02:11:13,325 --> 02:11:19,665
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Whoo! Marcee!

1753
02:11:19,831 --> 02:11:21,500
- Baby, I love you.
- I love my kids!

1754
02:11:21,667 --> 02:11:23,961
Tyson. My new baby, Katie.

1755
02:11:24,127 --> 02:11:29,299
My older brother, who got one leg,
and my younger brother, Tee Pee.

1756
02:11:29,466 --> 02:11:33,262
You're militant, but I ain't mad at you.
Nothing but love for you.

1757
02:11:33,428 --> 02:11:36,557
I love my teammates.
I'm leaving somebody out here.

1758
02:11:36,848 --> 02:11:42,062
- We only have a half-hour show.
- I send love to my offensive line.

1759
02:11:43,063 --> 02:11:47,776
- Nice to see you. Congratulations.
- Thank you. How are you?

1760
02:11:47,943 --> 02:11:51,154
Hey, Jerry, how you doing? You
remember Troy from the Super Bowl?

1761
02:11:51,321 --> 02:11:52,364
We met in '93.

1762
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:55,867
- That's right. I enjoyed your memo.
- Thank you.

1763
02:11:56,201 --> 02:12:00,372
- A little slow but you come around.
- We're out of time. About 10 seconds--

1764
02:12:00,539 --> 02:12:03,375
Wait, wait, wait.
Roy, I'm forgetting somebody.

1765
02:12:05,043 --> 02:12:07,087
Jerry Maguire...

1766
02:12:07,796 --> 02:12:09,590
...my agent.

1767
02:12:12,759 --> 02:12:14,845
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

1768
02:12:17,389 --> 02:12:21,476
Rod, thank you so much.
Congratulations. We'll be right back.

1769
02:12:25,314 --> 02:12:29,860
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

1770
02:12:30,027 --> 02:12:32,904
One, two, three. Swing!

1771
02:12:35,616 --> 02:12:37,826
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

1772
02:12:38,619 --> 02:12:40,245
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

1773
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:46,418
Whoa.

1774
02:12:47,961 --> 02:12:50,589
- Good throw, man.
- Nice throw.

1775
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:54,009
Did you see?

1776
02:12:54,676 --> 02:12:56,637
Oh, no. Ha, ha. Let's go.

1777
02:12:58,055 --> 02:13:00,015
- What?
- Nothing.

1778
02:13:00,182 --> 02:13:02,809
I'm not saying we'll throw him
into the major leagues tomorrow...

1779
02:13:02,976 --> 02:13:05,812
...but if he's got natural talent,
pure joy for the game....

1780
02:13:05,979 --> 02:13:09,566
I know the right people
that will help develop his talent.

1781
02:13:23,497 --> 02:13:26,541
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

1782
02:13:26,792 --> 02:13:32,214
In life, to be honest,
I've failed as much as I've succeeded.

1783
02:13:32,547 --> 02:13:36,134
But I love my wife, I love my life...

1784
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:39,137
...and I wish you my kind of success.
