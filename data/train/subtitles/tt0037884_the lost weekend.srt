1
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,926
You'd better take this along, Don.
It's gonna be cold on the farm.

2
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,963
- OK.
- How many shirts are you taking?

3
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,969
- Three.
- I'm taking five.

4
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,969
- Five?
- Yeah, I told them at the office

5
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,969
I might not be back until Tuesday.

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,402
We'll get there this afternoon.
That's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

7
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,126
We'll make it
a long, wonderful weekend.

8
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,651
Sounds long, all right.

9
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,286
It'll be good for you, Don,
after what you've been through.

10
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,444
Trees, grass,
sweet cider and buttermilk

11
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,642
and water from that well
that's colder than any other...

12
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,128
Wick, please. Why this emphasis
on liquids? Very dull liquids.

13
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,405
Sorry, Don.

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,126
I think it'd be a good idea
if we took along my typewriter.

15
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,208
- What for?
- To write.

16
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm gonna write there,
get started on that novel.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,169
- You really feel up to writing?
- Why not?

18
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,009
After what you've been through.

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,407
I haven't touched the stuff
for 10 days now.

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,000
I know.
I know you haven't, Don.

21
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,691
- Where is the typewriter?
- In the living room.

22
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,689
In the closet.

23
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,407
Kind of towards the back.

24
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,723
Are you sure it's in the closet?
I can't find it.

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,161
Well, look by the desk.

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,966
Isn't it under your bed?

27
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,566
- Did you find it?
- Oh, sure, sure. Here it is.

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,122
Here's some paper. Here's what we'll do.
We'll fix up a table on the south porch.

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,242
Nobody will disturb you.
I'll see to it.

30
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,328
Maybe Saturday, we can run down
to the country club.

31
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,642
- I'm not going near that club.
- Why not?

32
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,161
They're all a bunch of hypocrites.
I don't like to be whispered about.

33
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,170
"Look who's here from New York,
the Birnam brothers."

34
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,084
Or rather,
the nurse and the invalid.

35
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,083
Stop it, Don.
Nobody there knows about you.

36
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,210
The minute we get off the train,
the alarm is sounded.

37
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,084
"The leper is back.
Hide your liquor."

38
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,049
- That's Helen.
- I'll take it.

39
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,206
- Helen.
- Hello, Wick. Where's Don?

40
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,483
I'm glad I made it.
I was afraid you'd be gone. Presents.

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,841
The new Thurber book
with comical jokes and pictures,

42
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,327
a nice, quiet little double-murder
by Agatha Christie,

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,649
cigarettes, chewing gum.
And darling, have a wonderful time.

44
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,888
And don't forget,
lots of sleep, lots of milk...

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,607
Lots of cider and lots of nice cold water
from the well, I know.

46
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,722
Bend down.

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,447
I must be going. I'm ten minutes late
for the concert already.

48
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,164
- So long, Wick.
- What concert?

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,365
Carnegie Hall. Bob Roller's conducting.
They gave me two tickets at the office.

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,448
- Who are you going with?
- Nobody.

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,689
Nobody? What are they playing?

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,885
Brahms' 2nd Symphony, some Beethoven,
Handel and not one note of Grieg.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,048
- Sounds wonderful.
- Goodbye, boys. See you Monday.

54
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,685
- Tuesday.
- Wait a minute.

55
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,320
- Wick, I just had a crazy idea.
- As for instance?

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,568
Who says we have to take
the 3:15 train?

57
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,803
- We could go on the 6:30.
- What are you talking about?

58
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,527
If we took a later train, Helen wouldn't
have to go the concert by herself.

59
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,688
She's got two tickets,
hasn't she?

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,406
No, I'm not going to upset
any of your plans.

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,003
- You're going on the 3:15.
- Oh, now, Helen, that's so silly.

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,282
A whale of a concert,
an empty seat next to you.

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,050
No, Don. Everything's all set.

64
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,964
They'll be at the station to meet us
and dinner will be waiting.

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,727
Put in a call that we're taking a later
train, dinner at 9:00, in bed by 10:00.

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,808
- Nothing doing. We're going.
- Wick is right.

67
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,442
Don't worry about that empty seat. I'll find
a handsome, South American millionaire.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,925
There you are, you hear?

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,281
Besides, we have to break our necks
anyway to catch the train.

70
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,970
- Five to three.
- You see?

71
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,563
- Don't be so stubborn, Wick.
- All right, go ahead.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,611
- Just a minute. I'm not going.
- Then what are we talking about?

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,609
I want you to go, you and Helen.

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,210
- Me and Helen?
- That's the idea.

75
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,971
- Who likes Brahms, you or I?
- Since when don't you like Brahms?

76
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,209
I'll just stick around here and
finish packing, take a little nap, maybe.

77
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,010
Nonsense. If anybody goes...

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,282
- Helen's your girl.
- There's something in that, Don.

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,323
And what's more,
I don't think you should be left alone.

80
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,090
- I shouldn't?
- No.

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,044
- Not to be trusted, is that it?
- After what you've been through...

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,527
I couldn't go to the concert.
I couldn't face the crowds.

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,483
I couldn't sit through it
with all those people.

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,171
Besides, I wanna be alone
for a couple hours to assemble myself.

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,009
Is that such
an extraordinary thing to want?

86
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,327
Don't act so outraged.
Would you mind?

87
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,205
- All right. Anything else?
- Please, boys.

88
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,649
Come on, Helen.

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,161
- You'll stay right here.
- Where would I go?

90
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,931
- Then you'll be here when we get back?
- I'm not leaving this apartment.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,883
You told us a good many things, Don.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,731
If you don't believe me take my keys,
lock me in like a dog!

93
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,047
We've got to trust Don.
That's the only way.

94
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,481
Sorry, Don.
Let's go, Helen.

95
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,841
- So long, Don.
- So long.

96
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,689
Bend down.

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,361
- What's this?
- That? Whiskey, isn't it?

98
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,050
- How did it get there?
- I don't know.

99
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,960
I suppose it dropped from some cloud,
or someone bounced it and it stuck there.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,606
- I guess I must have put it there.
- Yes, you must.

101
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,530
But I don't remember when.
Probably during my last spell.

102
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,722
Maybe the one before.
I don't know.

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,805
Don't look at me like that, Helen.
It doesn't mean a thing.

104
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,400
I didn't know it was there.
If I had, I wouldn't have touched it.

105
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,046
- Then you won't mind.
- Mind what?

106
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,725
- Now, you trot along with Helen.
- Why? Because of that?

107
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,286
You think I wanted you out
of the apartment because of the bottle?

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,801
I resent that like the devil.
If there's one more word of discussion,

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,287
I don't leave on your blasted weekend!

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,249
Let's go, Wick.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,889
You'll be good, won't you,
Don, darling?

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,401
Yes, Helen. Will you stop
watching me all the time, you too?

113
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,921
Let me work it out my way.
I'm trying. I'm trying!

114
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,128
We know you're trying, Don.

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,686
We're both trying.
You're trying not to drink

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,770
and I'm trying not to love you.

117
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,051
Call the farm, Don, and tell them
we're taking the 6:30.

118
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,969
Sure.

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,491
So long.

120
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,766
'Come on, Helen.
He'll be all right.'

121
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,644
What if he goes out
and buys another bottle?

122
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,047
He hasn't a nickel.
There isn't a store or a bar,

123
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,924
that'll give him
five cents' worth of credit.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,407
- He doesn't have another bottle hidden?
- Not anymore.

125
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,921
I went over the apartment
with a fine-tooth comb.

126
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,451
The places he can figure out.

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,687
Who is it? Who is it?

128
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,723
Mrs Foley.
I've come to clean up.

129
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,362
Well, not today.
Does it have to be today?

130
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,324
I ought to change the sheets,
and it's my day to vacuum.

131
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,603
- Come on Monday.
- All right, Mr Birnam.

132
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,166
- Is your brother in?
- No, he isn't.

133
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,682
What about my money?
Didn't he leave my money?

134
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,247
- What money?
- My ten dollars.

135
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,364
- Didn't he leave it?
- Probably. Where would he leave it?

136
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,563
- In the kitchen.
- Where in the kitchen?

137
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,569
In the sugar bowl.

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,525
Just a minute.

139
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,447
I'm sorry, Mrs Foley, it isn't there.
He must've forgotten.

140
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,882
Oh, putt!
I wanted to do some shopping.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,810
- You'll get it Monday.
- All right, Mr Birnam.

142
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,041
- Two bottles of rye.
- I'm sorry, Mr Birnam.

143
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,162
- What are you sorry about?
- Your brother was in.

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,284
He's not gonna pay for you anymore.
That was the last time.

145
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
- Two bottles of rye.
- What brand?

146
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,966
You know what brand, Mr Brophy.
The cheapest.

147
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,084
None of that 12-year-old,
aged-in-the-wood chichi. Not for me.

148
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,208
- Liquor's all one anyway.
- You want a bag?

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,322
Yes, I want a bag.

150
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,526
Your brother said not to sell to you
even if you did have the money.

151
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,644
But I can't stop anybody, can I?
Not unless you're a minor.

152
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,331
I'm not a minor, Mr Brophy.
And just to ease your conscience

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,647
I'm buying this to refill
my cigarette lighter.

154
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,642
Yes, sir?

155
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,168
Thank you.

156
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,007
- Good afternoon, Mrs Deveridge.
- Hello, Mr Birnam.

157
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,130
That's the nice young man
who drinks.

158
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,401
- How's my very good friend Nat today?
- Yes, Mr Birnam?

159
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,363
This being an especially
fine afternoon,

160
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,448
I have decided to ask
for your hand in marriage.

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,087
If that's your attitude, I'll have to
drown my sorrows with a jigger of rye.

162
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,363
- Just one, that's all.
- It can't be done, Mr Birnam.

163
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,211
It can't?
Let me guess why.

164
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,766
My brother was here,
undermining my financial structure.

165
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,451
I didn't tell him nothing about
the wristwatch or the cuff links.

166
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,050
Thank you very much, Nat.

167
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,562
Today you'll be glad to know
we can barter on a cash basis.

168
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,047
- One straight rye.
- That was the idea.

169
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,408
Don't wipe it away, Nat.

170
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,966
Let me have my little vicious circle.

171
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,369
You know, the circle
is the perfect geometric figure.

172
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,801
No end, no beginning.

173
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,526
- What time is it?
- A quarter of 4:00.

174
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,041
Good. We have
the whole afternoon together.

175
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,481
Let me know when it's a quarter
of 6:00. It's very important.

176
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,324
I'm going to the country
for a weekend with my brother.

177
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,444
Hello, Mr Birnam. Happy to have you
back with the organisation.

178
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,882
Hello, Gloria.
I wish I could take you along, Nat.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,129
You and all that goes with you.

180
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,040
Not that I'm cutting myself off
from civilisation altogether.

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,323
Now, of course, there arises the problem
of transportation into the country.

182
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,683
How to smuggle these two time bombs
past the Royal Guard.

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,371
I'll roll one bottle in a copy
of the Saturday Evening Post

184
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,289
so my brother
can discover it like that.

185
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,290
And I want him to discover it.
Because it'll set his mind at ease.

186
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,131
The other bottle...
Come here.

187
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,645
That one I'm tucking
into my brother's suitcase.

188
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,889
He shall transport it himself
without knowing it, of course.

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,162
Then while he's greeting
the caretaker,

190
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,241
I'll slide it out, hide it
in a hollow old apple tree.

191
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,682
Oh, Mr Birnam, why don't you
lay off the stuff for a while?

192
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,201
I may never touch it
while I'm there, not a drop.

193
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,085
What you don't understand is
that I've got to know it's around.

194
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,851
I can have it if I need it.
I can't be cut off completely.

195
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,327
That's the devil.
That's what drives you crazy.

196
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,011
Yeah, I know a lot of guys like that.

197
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,401
They take a bottle
and put it on the shelf.

198
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,650
All they wanna do is just look at it.
They'll corkscrew it to make sure.

199
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,209
Then all of the sudden, they grab
the bottle, bite off the neck.

200
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,609
One more reproving word, I shall
consult our lawyer about a divorce.

201
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,324
Don't forget, quarter of 6:00.

202
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,808
My brother must find me home,
ready and packed.

203
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,525
Shall we dance?

204
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,487
You're awfully pretty, Mr Birnam.

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,170
I bet you tell that
to all the boys.

206
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,965
Why, natch.
Only with you, it's on the level.

207
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,731
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

208
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,889
Thanks a lot, but no, thanks.
There's somebody waiting.

209
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,211
Him? I bet he wears arch supporters.

210
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,243
Oh, he's just an old friend of the folks.

211
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,125
Lovely gentleman.
He buys me dimpled scotch.

212
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,450
He should buy you Indian rubies and
a villa in Calcutta overlooking the Ganges.

213
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,291
- Don't be ridic.
- Gloria, please.

214
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,483
Why imperil our friendship
with these loathsome abbreviations?

215
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,482
I could make myself free
for later on, if you want.

216
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,649
No, Gloria, I'm going away
for the weekend. Some other time.

217
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,762
Anytime.

218
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,202
I'm just crazy about
the back of your hair.

219
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,767
Nat, weave me another.

220
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,281
- You'd better take it easy.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

221
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
Just let me know
when it's a quarter of 6:00.

222
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,810
Come on, Nat, join me.
One little jigger of dreams.

223
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,924
- No, thanks.
- You don't approve of drinking?

224
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,048
Not the way you drink.

225
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,561
It shrinks my liver, doesn't it, Nat?

226
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,001
It pickles my kidneys, yes.

227
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,044
But what does it do to my mind?

228
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,243
It tosses the sandbags overboard
so the balloon can soar.

229
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,887
Suddenly, I'm above the ordinary.
I'm competent, supremely competent.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,367
I'm walking a tightrope
over Niagara Falls.

231
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,209
I'm one of the great ones.

232
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,926
I'm Michelangelo
moulding the beard of Moses.

233
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,883
I'm van Gogh painting pure sunlight.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,049
I'm Horowitz playing
the "Emperor Concerto".

235
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,891
I'm John Barrymore before
the movies got him by the throat.

236
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,083
I'm Jesse James and his two brothers.
All three of them!

237
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,641
I'm W Shakespeare.

238
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,161
And out there,
it's not 3rd Avenue any longer.

239
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,850
It's the Nile, Nat,

240
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,447
the Nile and down it floats
the barge of Cleopatra.

241
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,928
Come here.

242
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,964
"Purple the sails, and so perfumed
that the winds were lovesick with them.

243
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,880
"The oars were silver which to the tune
of flutes kept stroke."

244
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,560
Maybe he's at Mirandi's or Nat's Bar,
that place on 42nd Street.

245
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,648
What difference does it make?

246
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,161
- You're not really going?
- I certainly am.

247
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,090
- You can't leave him alone four days.
- Yes, I can.

248
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,249
Oh, for heaven's sake.
If he's left alone, anything can happen.

249
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,250
I'm tied up at the office every minute
all Saturday, all Sunday.

250
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,727
I can't look out for him.
You know how he gets.

251
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,162
He'll be run over by a car. He'll be arrested.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

252
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,726
A cigarette might fall from his mouth,
and he'd burn in bed.

253
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,684
Oh, Helen, if it happens it happens,
and I hope it does.

254
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,650
I've had six years of this.
I've had my belly full!

255
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,365
- Wick, you can't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

256
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,051
- It's terrible, I know, but I mean it.
- For heaven's sakes...

257
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,528
Who are we fooling?
We've tried everything, haven't we?

258
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,564
We've reasoned with him, babied him,
watched him like a hawk.

259
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,684
We've tried trusting him.
How often have you tried?

260
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,882
How often have I beaten him up?

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,686
Scrape him out of a gutter and pump
some kind of self-respect into him,

262
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,770
and back he falls,
back in every time.

263
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,844
He's a sick person.

264
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,770
It's as though something were wrong
with his heart or lungs.

265
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,202
You wouldn't walk out on him
if he had an attack. He needs our help.

266
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,051
He won't accept our help.
Not Don, he hates us.

267
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,606
He wants to be alone
with that bottle of his.

268
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,961
It's all he gives a hang about.

269
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,850
Why kid ourselves?
He's a hopeless alcoholic.

270
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,321
"The cloud-capped towers,
the gorgeous palaces...

271
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,323
Nat!

272
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,370
"The solemn temples,
the great globe itself."

273
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,642
Mr Birnam, you ought to go home.
It's late.

274
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,888
"Yea, all which it inherit
shall dissolve."

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,968
You oughta go home
on account of your brother.

276
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,731
- Who says so?
- You said you're going away somewhere.

277
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,605
- Don't you remember?
- What time is it?

278
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,688
- Ten past 6:00.
- Why didn't you tell me?

279
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,723
What do you think I've been doing
for half an hour?

280
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,888
Hey, hey, your change!

281
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,167
Taxi! Taxi! I'll give you a lift
as far as Grand Central.

282
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,284
- No, thanks. I'm gonna wait here.
- You're crazy.

283
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,290
Because I won't give up?
Maybe I am.

284
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
Let go of him, Helen.
Give yourself a chance.

285
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,082
Goodbye, Wick.

286
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,126
<i>Hey...</i>

287
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,971
I thought you was going away
for the weekend.

288
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,211
For Pete's sake! What are you doing?
Give me a drink.

289
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,607
Be right with you.
Just fixing myself some lunch.

290
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,803
Stop it and give me a drink.
Come on. Come on!

291
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,008
OK.

292
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,524
- Can't you hurry it up a little?
- Here you are, Mr Birnam.

293
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,208
That young lady stopped in
last night looking for you.

294
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,001
- What young lady?
- The one with the leopard coat.

295
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,326
Yeah?

296
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,681
She acted like
she just happened to drop in.

297
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,723
But I know she was making
the rounds after you.

298
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,491
- What did you say to her?
- You haven't been in for two weeks.

299
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,410
That's good. I can't let her see me,
not when I'm off like this.

300
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,249
Why don't you cut it short?

301
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,886
Don't talk like a child.
I can't cut it short.

302
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,401
Get on the merry-go-round,
you gotta ride it all the way.

303
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,171
Round and round till that
blasted music wears itself out

304
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,442
and the thing dies down
and clunks to a stop.

305
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,723
- How about you eating some of this?
- Take it away.

306
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,968
You gotta eat something sometime.

307
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,208
Just give me another drink.

308
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,641
Mr Birnam, this is the morning.

309
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,168
That's when you need it most, in the
morning. Haven't you learned that yet?

310
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,760
At night, the stuff's a drink.
In the morning, it's medicine.

311
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,168
- OK if I eat?
- A little to one side.

312
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,442
Nat, are you ever scared
when you wake up?

313
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,642
So scared,
the sweat starts out of you, huh?

314
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,525
No, not you.
With you, it's simple.

315
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,768
The alarm clock goes off,
you open your eyes,

316
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,929
brush your teeth
and read the Daily Mirror. That's all.

317
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,566
You ever lie in your bed,
looking at the window?

318
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,445
A little daylight's coming through,
and you start to wonder.

319
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,528
Is it getting lighter?
Is it getting darker?

320
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,531
Is it dawn or is it dusk?
That's a terrifying problem, Nat.

321
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,688
Because if it's dawn, you're dead.

322
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,320
The bars are closed,
the liquor stores don't open until 9:00.

323
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,807
And you can't last until 9:00!

324
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,407
Or it may be Sunday.
That's the worst.

325
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,565
No liquor stores at all, and you guys
wouldn't open a bar until 1:00. Why?

326
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,206
Because we gotta go to church
once in a while. That's why.

327
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,164
Yeah, when a guy needs it most.

328
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,288
What happened to those two quarts?
You polished 'em off last night?

329
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
- What two quarts?
- The two bottles you had.

330
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,291
That's right,
I did have two bottles, didn't I?

331
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,085
I hid one of them.
I've still got it.

332
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,761
I'm a capitalist, Nat.
I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!

333
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,042
If you had enough money,
you'd kill yourself in a month.

334
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,130
Say, Nat, was there a gentleman here...?
Hello, Mr Birnam.

335
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,925
- Didn't you go away for the weekend?
- Apparently not, Gloria.

336
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,771
- Was there a gentleman asking for me?
- Not to my knowledge, there wasn't.

337
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,247
He was supposed to come around 11:00.
He's from Albany.

338
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,569
- Another friend of the folks?
- More a friend of a friend of the folks type.

339
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,160
A fellow called me up about him.
Wants me to show him the town.

340
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,601
- Like Grant's tomb, for instance?
- For def.

341
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,921
Ain't it amazing how many guys come
from Albany to see Grant's tomb?

342
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,727
Sometimes, I wish
you came from Albany.

343
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,569
Yeah? Where would you take me?

344
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,082
Lots of places. Music Hall,
the New Yorker roof, maybe.

345
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,010
There is now being presented
at a theatre on 44th Street

346
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,043
the uncut version of "Hamlet".

347
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,049
I see us as setting out for that.

348
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,561
- Do you know "Hamlet"?
- I know 44th Street.

349
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,769
I'd like to get your interpretation
of Hamlet's character.

350
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,291
I'd like to give it to you.

351
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,368
Dinner later, I think.
Nothing before.

352
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,086
One should always see Shakespeare
on an empty stomach.

353
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,170
- Not even a pretzel?
- Could I have a glass of water?

354
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,681
Why, sure.
What'll it be for a chaser?

355
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,284
- This is Nat's Bar, isn't it?
- That's what the man said.

356
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,203
I'm looking for a young lady,
name of Gloria.

357
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,650
- Are you Miss Gloria?
- Me? No, I'm not. I just live with Gloria.

358
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,205
- She's not here.
- She isn't?

359
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,688
She's sick, went to the hospital.
Ruptured appendix, middle of last night.

360
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,326
Went like that... Putt!
Scared the life out of me.

361
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,204
Oh, that's terrible.

362
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,005
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

363
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,168
Could I have a word with you?

364
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,090
No, thanks.
Thanks a lot, but no, thanks.

365
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,601
- You're welcome. Sure.
- Don't mench.

366
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,650
- Nat!
- Coming.

367
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,481
Now, wasn't it rather rude to send
that nice man alone to Grant's tomb?

368
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,409
When I've a chance
to go out with you?

369
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,683
- Don't be ridic.
- Oh, is our engagement definite?

370
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,644
- You meant it, didn't you?
- Surely, surely.

371
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,525
I've gotta get a facial, a finger wave,
the works, right now.

372
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,246
- You're gonna call for me, aren't you?
- What time do you suggest?

373
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,930
- How's 8:00?
- 8:00's fine.

374
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,646
I live right in the corner house
where the antique shop is,

375
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,171
with the wooden Indian outside.

376
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,965
- "I got the Indian side in me," I say.
- I'll be there.

377
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,082
Second floor, front.

378
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,090
Oh, Mr Birnam,
all I got is a semiformal.

379
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,362
- Will that be all right?
- That'll be fine.

380
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,686
So long, Nat.

381
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,365
One last one, Nat.

382
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,529
Pour it softly, pour it gently
and pour it to the brim.

383
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,927
Look, Mr Birnam, there are
a lot of bars on 3rd Avenue.

384
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,327
Do me a favour?
Get out and buy it somewhere else.

385
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,807
- What's the matter?
- What's the idea of pulling her leg?

386
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,490
- You'll not take her out.
- Who says?

387
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,762
I say so! You're drunk and
just making with the mouth.

388
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,366
- Give me a drink.
- That other dame, the lady, I mean...

389
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,211
- I don't like what you're doing to her.
- Oh, shut up.

390
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,368
You should've seen her last night
looking for you,

391
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,369
her eyes all rainy
and the mascara all washed away.

392
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,404
- Give me a drink!
- That's an awful high-class young lady.

393
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,091
- You bet she is.
- How did she get mixed up with a guy

394
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,965
- who sops it up like you do?
- It's a problem, isn't it?

395
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,162
That nice young man who drinks
and the high-class young lady.

396
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,887
How did she get mixed up with him?
Why does he drink? Why doesn't he stop?

397
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,968
That's my novel, Nat.

398
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,287
I oughta start writing it
out in the country.

399
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,689
Morbid stuff. Nothing for the Book
of the Month club. A horror story.

400
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,043
The Long Book of an Alcoholic".

401
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,081
Oh, come on, Nat.
Break down, will ya?

402
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,601
You know what I'm gonna call my novel?
"The Bottle".

403
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,610
That's all.
Very simply "The Bottle".

404
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,562
I've got it all here in my mind.

405
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,961
Let me tell you the first chapter.

406
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,243
It all starts one wet afternoon
about three years ago.

407
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,204
There was a matinee
of "La Traviata" at the Metropolitan.

408
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,809
Check your hat and coat, sir.

409
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,687
- Here.
- Did you forget something?

410
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,610
No, just going home,
if it's all right with you.

411
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,968
- Hey, this isn't yours, is it?
- It certainly isn't.

412
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,287
- That's what is says, 417.
- I don't care what it says.

413
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,687
- The checks must've gotten mixed up.
- Maybe they did.

414
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,371
Find me my coat.
It's a plain men's raincoat and a derby.

415
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,802
Do you know how many plain men's
raincoats we have on a day like this?

416
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,161
- About a thousand.
- Let me get back there. I can find it.

417
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,645
Oh, no, please.
That's against regulations, sir.

418
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,001
I'm not gonna wait here
until the end of the performance.

419
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,202
- Well, you can get your coat tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

420
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,051
Look, man, there's something
in the pocket of that coat that <i>I...</i>

421
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,721
Well, it so happens I found myself
without any money. I need that coat now!

422
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,366
Listen, if everybody went
diggin' in through those coats...

423
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,131
There's regulations.
There's got to be regulations!

424
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,368
Then what do you suggest?

425
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,488
Wait till the other party arrives
and swap.

426
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,931
I want my coat!

427
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,840
As far as I'm concerned, mister,
that's your coat.

428
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,163
You're a great help.

429
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,882
- That's my coat you've got.
- And that's mine, thank heaven.

430
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,571
- They mixed up the checks.
- I thought you'd never come.

431
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,810
- You couldn't have waited so long.
- Since the first aria of the first act.

432
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,884
- You drop in just for the overture?
- Goodbye.

433
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,129
Oh, just a minute.

434
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,207
Oh, my umbrella, if you don't mind.

435
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,563
- Catch.
- Thank you very much.

436
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,763
I'm terribly sorry.

437
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,690
You're the rudest person I've ever seen.
What's the matter with you?

438
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,610
- Just rude, I guess.
- Somebody should talk to your mother.

439
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,690
- They tried, Miss St John.
- My name's not St John.

440
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,246
- St Joseph, then.
- St James.

441
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,170
First name Hilda or Helen
or Harriet, maybe.

442
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,726
- Helen.
- All right, Helen.

443
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,083
- I also know you come from Toledo, Ohio.
- You do? How?

444
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,044
I've had three long acts
to work you out from that coat of yours.

445
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,370
Initials, label.
Alfred Spitzer Fine Furs, Toledo, Ohio.

446
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,642
Maybe I should've explored
your coat.

447
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,967
- But you didn't, though?
- Didn't have time.

448
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,401
Good. My name is Don Birnam.

449
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,966
How do you do?

450
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,401
- Well, how do you like New York?
- Love it.

451
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,683
- You intend to stay long?
- Oh, 60 years, perhaps.

452
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,209
- I live here now. I have a job.
- Doing what?

453
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,049
- "Time Magazine".
- Oh, "Time Magazine".

454
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,770
Perhaps you can do something for me.

455
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,486
- Yes?
- Help me become "Man of the Year"?

456
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,331
- Delighted. What do you do?
- Yes, what do I do?

457
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,090
I'm a writer.
I've just started a novel.

458
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,771
In fact I've started several,
but I never seem to finish one.

459
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,130
- Why not write short stories?
- I have some of those... first paragraph.

460
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,208
Then there's one half
of the opening scene of a play

461
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,004
which takes place in
the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

462
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,569
It attempts to explain why it leans and
why all sensible buildings should lean.

463
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,047
- They'll love that in Toledo.
- Oh, by the way.

464
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,050
- Are you coming to hear Lohengrin?
- I don't know.

465
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,811
Because if you are, I'm not letting
this coat out of my hands.

466
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,763
- Don't worry.
- Oh, but I do.

467
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,043
To be really safe,
we should go together.

468
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,646
- We could.
- Are you in the phone book?

469
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,042
- Yes, but I'm not home very much.
- I'd call you at your office.

470
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,401
Editorial research.
If Henry Luce answers, hang up.

471
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,965
All right.

472
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,602
- Would you like a taxi?
- No, thanks, I'm taking the subway.

473
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,205
Oh, very sensible.

474
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,881
I'm going to an extremely crazy party
on Washington Square.

475
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,082
If you like, I'll take you along.

476
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,327
Oh, thank you very much, Miss St James,
but I have to see a friend uptown.

477
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,843
- Goodbye, Mr Birnam.
- Goodbye.

478
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,691
- Who threw that?
- It fell out of my pocket.

479
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,882
- Do you always carry those things?
- Well, no.

480
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,566
You see, that friend of mine uptown,
he has a slight cold.

481
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,251
I thought I'd take this along
and make him a hot toddy.

482
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,886
- See he gets hot lemonade and aspirin.
- I shall.

483
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,604
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

484
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,164
Oh, Miss St James.

485
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,371
- Yes?
- What kind of party did you ask me to?

486
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,330
- A cocktail party.
- Invitation still stand?

487
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,448
Of course. Come on.

488
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,327
So they go to that cocktail party,
he gets stinko and falls flat on his face.

489
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,887
He does not. By this time,
he's crazy about the girl.

490
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,805
He drinks tomato juice.
Doesn't touch liquor that whole week.

491
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,969
- For two weeks, for six weeks.
- In love, huh?

492
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,527
That's what's gonna be
so hard to write.

493
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,450
Love is the hardest thing
in the world to write about.

494
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,882
It's so simple,
you gotta catch it through details,

495
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,129
like the early morning sunlight
hitting the grey tin of the rain spout

496
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,810
in front of her house.

497
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,845
The ringing of a telephone that
sounds like Beethoven's "Pastoral".

498
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,770
A letter scribbled on her office
stationery you carry in your pocket,

499
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,611
because it smells like
all the lilacs in Ohio.

500
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,449
Pour it, Nat.

501
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,281
He thinks he's cured.

502
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,847
If he could only get a job now,
they'd be married and that's that.

503
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,645
But it's not, Nat.
Not quite.

504
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,843
Because one day, one terrible day...

505
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,001
Yeah. Go on.

506
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,570
You see, this girl has been writing
to her people in Toledo.

507
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,729
They wanna meet the young man,
so they come to New York.

508
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,047
They stay at the Hotel Manhattan.

509
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,721
Their very first day,
she's to introduce him to her parents.

510
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,764
One o'clock, lobby of the hotel.

511
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,451
That wasn't enough,
not for New York.

512
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,928
He gave me a shampoo, scalp massage
and a manicure.

513
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,361
I thought they were going to tear off
my shoes and paint my toenails.

514
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,211
Ha-ha!
I had a lovely morning.

515
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,369
Just did a little window shopping.
Didn't want to get all tired out.

516
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,245
On account of meeting
that young man? Now, Mother.

517
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
Who did you get
that haircut for?

518
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,643
- Wonder what's keeping Helen.
- She'll be here.

519
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,969
- This Birnam fellow went to Cornell?
- I believe so.

520
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,560
He never graduated.
I wonder why.

521
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,205
- How old is he?
- Thirty-three.

522
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,682
He has no job. As far as
I can find out, he never had one.

523
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,689
I wish Helen wasn't so vague.

524
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,929
Maybe he has a little money.
Some people do you know, Father.

525
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,646
- He ought to have a job anyway.
- He's a writer.

526
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,888
What did he write?
I never heard his name.

527
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,567
Father, relax.
You always expect the worst.

528
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,570
I hope he realises
that Helen's our only daughter.

529
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,489
We ought to know
a few things about him.

530
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,050
It'll all come out, his background,
his prospects, his church affiliations...

531
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,530
Hotel Manhattan?
Could you page Miss Helen St James?

532
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,286
St James. Yes, she's in the lobby.

533
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,884
Helen? Don.

534
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,970
Darling, I'm terribly sorry, but I won't
be able to get there for awhile.

535
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,444
Will you please go ahead and have
your lunch and apologise to your parents?

536
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,642
Oh, nothing serious. I'll be there.

537
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,364
Good bye.

538
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,645
- Turn off that light!
- Don.

539
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,764
- Turn it off!
- For heaven's sake, Don.

540
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,768
I thought you were with Helen
and her father and mother.

541
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,769
What happened?

542
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,445
- Come on, Don.
- I couldn't face it.

543
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,849
- Didn't you go to see them?
- Certainly I went, 1:00 sharp.

544
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,850
I saw them, all right,
only they didn't see me.

545
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,123
- How was that?
- Such nice, respectable people.

546
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,005
I couldn't face them.
And all the questions they'd ask me?

547
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,202
I just couldn't do it, not cold.

548
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,609
I had to have a drink first, just one,
only the one didn't do anything to me.

549
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,803
So you had another and another.
Oh, you poor idiot, Don.

550
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,048
Won't you ever learn?
With you, it's like stepping off a roof

551
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,290
- and expecting to fall just one floor.
- Will you call her, Wick?

552
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,290
Tell her something.
Tell her I'm sick, tell her I'm dead.

553
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,006
- Will you call?
- Yes, I'll call.

554
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,203
She must've written them
a lot of nice things about me.

555
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,926
What a gentleman I am, a prince.

556
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,281
- Which hotel is it?
- The Manhattan.

557
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,121
Mr and Mrs Charles St James
of Toledo, Ohio.

558
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,845
Get up, Don!

559
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,291
Just a minute, Helen.

560
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,448
- Hello, Wick. Is Don here?
- Don? No.

561
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,769
- Any idea where he could be?
- Wasn't he meeting you?

562
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,929
He was supposed to meet us for lunch.
He telephoned he'd be late.

563
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,362
Mother's beginning to think
I just made him up.

564
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,609
- Suppose something happened to him.
- Nonsense.

565
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,643
Surely he'd have called
if he were all right.

566
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,728
- Where did he call you from?
- I don't know.

567
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,286
I have an idea.
He called you from out of town.

568
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,408
- Out of town? Where?
- Philadelphia.

569
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,603
- What's he doing in Philadelphia?
- There's an opening on the "Enquirer".

570
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,770
Don wrote them, wired them,
and this morning took an early train.

571
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,609
Oh, why, he didn't tell me
a word about it.

572
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,361
I...I'm not supposed to tell you either.
He wanted it to be a surprise.

573
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,766
- He did?
- Yes.

574
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,367
He probably couldn't meet the right
people right away. You know how it is.

575
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,848
It would be wonderful if he got the job
and started working.

576
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,525
Or would it, Wick?

577
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,762
With him in Philadelphia
and me in New York?

578
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,082
- Don't ever tell him I said that though.
- Of course not.

579
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,488
I could never understand why somebody
like Don, a person with such talent,

580
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,682
such flashes of real brilliance...

581
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,849
Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced.
What are you doing, Wick?

582
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,850
- Nothing.
- Where did that bottle come from?

583
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,486
- It just rolled out.
- From under the couch?

584
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,329
Yes, Helen.

585
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,361
It's my guess that
Don caught an early train and...

586
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,051
- Is that Don's bottle?
- What makes you think that?

587
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,323
There was a bottle
the first time we met.

588
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,523
- There was?
- It fell out of Don's pocket.

589
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,361
That was for me, Helen.
This one's mine too.

590
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,041
You might as well hear
the family scandal. I drink.

591
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,731
Don thinks I drink too much.
I promised to go on the wagon.

592
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,845
- I hid the bottle so he wouldn't see it.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Wick.

593
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,327
I shouldn't have started
asking questions.

594
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,801
It's really none of my business.

595
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,570
Forget it, Helen.

596
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,965
I better be getting back to the hotel.
Don's probably there already.

597
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,208
And don't worry,
I won't mention a word of it to him.

598
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,685
- Thank you.
- Bye.

599
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,723
Helen!

600
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,483
I'm sorry, Helen.
I can't let you go, not like this.

601
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,284
- Don?
- Shut your mouth, Don.

602
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,041
- I'll take you downstairs.
- Thanks for your Philadelphia story.

603
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,889
Nice try.

604
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,571
- That looks so silly on you.
- Don't listen to him.

605
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,200
She doesn't have to.
Just look at the two of us.

606
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,368
Yes. What is all this covering up?

607
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,682
All that happened is Don was nervous
of meeting your parents,

608
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,564
and so he had a couple of drinks.

609
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,411
Come on, Wick.
She'd have found out sooner or later.

610
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,124
Stop it, both of you.

611
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,488
Don's a little tight.
Most people drink a little.

612
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,568
A lot of them get tight
once in a while.

613
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,047
Sure, the lucky ones
who can take it or leave it.

614
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,647
But then there are the ones who can't
take it and can't leave it either.

615
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,366
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm not a drinker.

616
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,245
I'm a drunk.
They had to put me away once.

617
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,966
- He went to a cure.
- Which didn't take.

618
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,686
That first time we met,
I should've had the decency

619
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,763
to get drunk just for your sake.

620
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,804
For my sake?
We're talking about you.

621
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,924
- Is it really that bad, Wick?
- Yes, it is!

622
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,646
Can't we go over this tomorrow,
when you're feeling more like yourself?

623
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,003
Helen's heard the facts.
That's all there is to it.

624
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,566
Yes, I've heard them,
and they're not too pleasant.

625
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,843
But they could be worse. After all,
you're not an embezzler or a murderer.

626
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,962
You drink too much,
and that's not fatal.

627
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,003
One cure didn't take.
There are others.

628
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,044
- Of course there are.
- This has a familiar ring.

629
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,123
But there must be a reason why you drink.

630
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,483
- The right doctor could find it.
- I'm way ahead of the right doctor.

631
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,922
I know the reason.
The reason is me, what I am.

632
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,601
Or rather, what I'm not...
what I wanted to become and didn't.

633
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,530
What is it you wanna be so much
that you're not?

634
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,288
A writer.

635
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,129
Silly, isn't it?

636
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,760
You know, in college,
I passed for a genius.

637
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,089
They couldn't get out the college
magazine without one of my stories.

638
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,488
Boy, was I hot. Hemingway stuff.

639
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,080
I reached my peak when I was 19.

640
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,489
Sold a piece to the "Atlantic Monthly",
reprinted in the "Reader's Digest".

641
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,968
Who wants to stay in college
when he's Hemingway?

642
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,521
My mother bought me
a brand-new typewriter.

643
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,927
And I moved right in on New York.

644
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,527
Well, the first thing I wrote,
that didn't quite come off.

645
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,361
And the second, I dropped.
The public wasn't ready for that one.

646
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,131
I started a third and a fourth.

647
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,887
Only by then, somebody began
to look over my shoulder and whisper,

648
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,891
in a thin, clear voice
like the E string on a violin.

649
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,890
"Don Birnam," he'd whisper.

650
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,048
"It's not good enough, not that way.

651
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,883
"How about a couple of drinks,
just to set it on its feet, huh?"

652
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,766
So I had a couple.
Oh, what a great idea that was.

653
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,724
That made all the difference.
Suddenly, I could see the whole thing.

654
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,050
The tragic sweep of the great novel,
beautifully proportioned.

655
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,050
But before I could really grab it
and throw it down on paper,

656
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,290
the drinks would wear off and
everything would be gone like a mirage.

657
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,370
Then there was despair.
I'd drink to counterbalance despair.

658
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,404
And then one to counterbalance
the counterbalance.

659
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,889
I'd sit in front of that typewriter,
trying to squeeze out

660
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,082
one page that was halfway decent.

661
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,722
- And that guy would pop up again.
- What guy? Who are you talking about?

662
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,889
The other Don Birnam.
There are two of us, you know.

663
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,049
Don the Drunk
and Don the Writer.

664
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,328
The drunk would say to the writer,

665
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,410
"Come on, you idiot. Let's get
some good out of that portable.

666
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,161
"Let's hock it. Let's take it
to that pawn shop on 3rd Avenue.

667
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,408
"It's always good for ten dollars.

668
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,128
"Another drink, another binge,
another bender, another spree."

669
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,402
Such humorous words.

670
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,170
I've tried to break away
from that guy a lot of times

671
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,123
but to no good.

672
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,761
You know, once I even got myself
a gun and some bullets.

673
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,804
I was gonna do it
on my 30th birthday.

674
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,163
Here are the bullets. The gun
went for three quarts of whiskey.

675
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,846
The other Don wanted us
to have a drink first.

676
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,567
He always wants us
to have a drink first!

677
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,081
The flop suicide of a flop writer.

678
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,567
Maybe you're not a writer.
Why don't you do something else?

679
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,808
Sure, take a nice job.

680
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,486
Public accountant,
real estate salesman.

681
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,602
I haven't the guts, Helen.

682
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,200
Most men lead lives
of quiet desperation.

683
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,891
- I can't take quiet desperation!
- But you are a writer.

684
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,243
You have every quality for it,
imagination, wit, pity.

685
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,842
Come on. Let's face reality.

686
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,611
I'm 33. I'm living
on the charity of my brother.

687
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,770
Room and board free,
fifty cents a week for cigarettes,

688
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,451
an occasional ticket
to a show or a concert.

689
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,122
All out of the bigness of his heart.
And it is a big heart and a patient one.

690
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,171
- No, Don, I've only been carrying you for...
- Shut up, Wick! I've never done anything.

691
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,647
I'm not doing anything.
I never will do anything!

692
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,410
Zero, zero, zero!

693
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,603
- Now you shut up. We'll straighten it out.
- Look.

694
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,291
Wick has the misfortune
of being my brother.

695
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,243
You just happened to walk in on this.

696
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,330
If you know what's good for you,
turn around and walk out.

697
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,250
And walk fast,
and don't turn back.

698
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,324
Why don't you make some coffee, Wick?
Strong, three cups.

699
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,166
Look, Helen, do yourself a favour.
Go on. Clear out.

700
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,762
Because I've got a rival?
Because you're in love with this?

701
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,646
You don't know me, Don.
I'm gonna fight and fight and fight.

702
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,811
Bend down.

703
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,964
All right.

704
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,562
That was three years ago, Nat.

705
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,331
That's a long time to keep fighting,
to keep believing.

706
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,762
She knows she's clutching a razor blade,
but she won't let go.

707
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,724
- Three years of it.
- And what?

708
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,128
- How's it come out?
- I don't know. I haven't figured that far.

709
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,322
Want me to tell you?

710
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,563
One day, a guy gets wise to himself,
he gets back that gun.

711
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,047
If he's only got $1.10, he goes
to the top of the Empire State Building.

712
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,322
Way up on top. And then...

713
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,330
Or you can do it for a nickel
in the subway under a train.

714
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,249
You think so, Nat?

715
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,443
What if Helen's right, and
this guy turns out something good,

716
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,531
- and that snaps him out of it.
- This guy? Not from where I sit.

717
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,122
Oh, shut up, Nat! I'm gonna do it now!
It's all there. You heard it.

718
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,005
- Yes, Mr Birnam.
- That's why I didn't go away.

719
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,407
So I can be alone up there
and sit down at my typewriter.

720
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,807
This time, I'm gonna do it, Nat!
I'm gonna do it!

721
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,729
- Maybe you will.
- Thank you, Nat.

722
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,811
- Am I all paid up?
- Yes, Mr Birnam.

723
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,809
Goodbye, Nat. I'm going home.

724
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,968
This time, I've got it.
I'm gonna write!

725
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,370
Good luck to you.

726
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,008
You had another bottle.
You know you did.

727
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,209
Where did you put it?
You're not crazy. Where did you put it?

728
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,403
<i>It was so beautiful, so wonderful</i>

729
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,046
<i>The stars above us shone</i>

730
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,810
<i>We were alone...</i>

731
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,361
- Cheque, please.
- Right here, sir.

732
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,048
- Yes, sir?
- Another gin vermouth, please.

733
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,889
Yes, sir.

734
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,405
Thank you.

735
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,611
- Where is your washroom?
- Over there, sir.

736
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,968
How's about a carnation
for your buttonhole?

737
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,809
No, thank you.

738
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,688
Thank you, sir.

739
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,211
- Wash your hands?
- Thank you.

740
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,651
All ready, sir.

741
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,085
- Would you wipe my shoes?
- Yes, sir.

742
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,605
- Carnation, sir?
- I already took one.

743
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,008
- You did?
- For a very kind lady.

744
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,451
Yes, sir.

745
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

746
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,887
- That's him! That's the man!
- You were sitting here, sir?

747
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,889
I beg your pardon?

748
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,409
You took this lady's bag, didn't you?
All right. Let's have it!

749
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,128
- Of course.
- Somebody call a cop!

750
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,567
No, George. It doesn't matter
as long as I have the bag.

751
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,887
Look in it.
Maybe he took something.

752
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,370
- Ten dollars, to be exact.
- I oughta kick your teeth in.

753
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,051
- George, he's drunk.
- Come on. Get out of here.

754
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,164
- How about the cheque?
- That's why I'd borrowed from the lady.

755
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,045
I didn't have enough.
I'll come back and pay the rest.

756
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,401
Don't you show your face
in here again ever! Mike!

757
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,286
- Take him out of here.
- Somebody stole a purse

758
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,846
- Everybody!
- Somebody stole the purse...

759
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,361
I assure you, I'm not a thief!
I'm not a thief!

760
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,441
Stop it, Helen. Stop it. Stop it.

761
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm all right. I just can't talk.

762
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,689
Please stop it!

763
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,648
You'll never make it.

764
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,481
You'll never make that hock shop.
It's a block and a half away.

765
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,841
- This isn't Sunday, is it?
- Huh?

766
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,645
- I asked, "Is this Sunday?"
- No. Saturday. Why?

767
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,286
But it's closed.
Nothing else is closed.

768
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,607
Somebody passed away, most likely.

769
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,920
- What's the matter with you?
- Why are they all closed?

770
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,247
They're all closed, every one of 'em.

771
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,806
- Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.
- It's what?

772
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,890
- It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.
- It is?

773
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,122
And what about Kelly's and Gallagher's?

774
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,527
They're closed too.
We've got an agreement.

775
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,804
They keep closed on Yom Kippur,
and we don't open on St Patrick's.

776
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,606
That's a good joke.
That's funny. That's very funny.

777
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,729
Yeah, Mr Birnam?

778
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,649
What do you want?

779
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,844
Let me have one, Nat.
I'm dying. Just one.

780
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,406
I thought you was home
writing that book.

781
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,481
They're playing a trick on me,
a dirty trick, Nat. Give me one.

782
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,843
I'll pay you when I can,
only just don't let me die here.

783
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,928
No credit, and you know it.

784
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,129
All right. It's charity.
I'm begging you. Give me one, Nat.

785
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,289
Yeah, one.

786
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,006
One's too many,
and a hundred's not enough.

787
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,244
That's all.

788
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,961
Come on, Nat.
I'll let you have my typewriter.

789
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,162
I'm no writer. You're the writer.

790
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,203
- Please.
- Go! Go away!

791
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,250
- Please, Nat.
- I mean it. Get out of here!

792
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,568
Who is it?

793
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,845
It's me.

794
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,724
Oh, Mr Don Birnam,
as I live and breathe.

795
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,320
If you're coming for our date,
you're a little late, aren't you?

796
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,364
If you're coming to apologise,
no, thanks. Thanks, but no, thanks.

797
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,443
- Gloria...
- Save your saliva!

798
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,166
I've had enough of you.
Deaf, but deaf.

799
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,726
What do you think I am?
I break a business date.

800
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,411
I buy me an evening purse,
a facial, a new hairdo.

801
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,285
You can do that to your ritzy friends,
but you can't to me.

802
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,606
<i>Gloria...</i>

803
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,088
OK, what do you want,
Mr Don Birnam, Esquire?

804
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,362
I need some money.

805
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,290
- You what?
- Could you let me have some money?

806
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,802
Say, you out of your mind?
Don't be ridic.

807
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,810
Get out of here!
Make with those stairs. Go on.

808
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,961
I waited half the night,
like it was the first date I ever had.

809
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,642
The other half, I was crying.

810
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,648
- How much money?
- Could you let me have ten or five?

811
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,444
I'll see.

812
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,005
You look awfully sick, Mr Birnam.
Have you got a fever or something?

813
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,724
I'm all right now.

814
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,966
Thank you a lot.
You do like me a little, don't you?

815
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,606
Why, natch, Gloria. Natch.

816
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,808
Gloria,
who have you got out there?

817
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,570
Coming.

818
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,131
It's a hap-hap-happy day...

819
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,962
What's this place?

820
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,327
Hey, you, what is this place?

821
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,322
I'm talking to you.

822
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,883
Good morning, Merry Sunshine.
How's your head?

823
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,923
Where am I? What is this place?

824
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,929
This? This is Hangover Plaza.

825
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,361
- What hospital is this?
- Alcoholic ward.

826
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,528
- How's your head?
- It aches.

827
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,688
Thought you had a fracture
till we looked at the X-rays.

828
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,565
Everything in one piece,
just a slight concussion.

829
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,489
Why'd they put me
in the alcoholic ward?

830
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,924
Are you kidding? We got a peek at
your blood. Straight applejack. 96 proof.

831
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,611
- What day is it?
- Sunday. Are these yours?

832
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,371
You and the coloured fellow were
being undressed at the same time.

833
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,121
- They fell out of somebody's pants.
- They're mine. You a doctor?

834
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,040
I'm a nurse, name of Nolan.
They call me Bim.

835
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,050
You can call me Bim.
What's your name?

836
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,366
Birnam.

837
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,921
- What kind of Birnam?
- Don Birnam.

838
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,010
- Where do you live?
- 209 East Vir...

839
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,804
- What do you need that for?
- For the postcard.

840
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,888
- What postcard?
- To your folks, so they know...

841
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,049
where honey boy is and can pick
him up when he's feeling better.

842
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,770
No address.

843
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,044
We'll get it out of the phone book
or the directory or your wallet.

844
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,731
Look. No postcard, understand?

845
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,128
- Nobody's gonna pick me up.
- The management insists.

846
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,971
If we let you guys go home alone,
a lot of you don't go home.

847
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,811
You just hit the nearest bar
and bounce right back again,

848
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,287
what we call the "quick ricochet".

849
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,210
Look, I'm as well as you are.
I can get out of here right now.

850
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,970
- Think so?
- Where are my clothes?

851
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,560
- Downstairs.
- How do I get out of this place?

852
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,523
Right through there.

853
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,770
- Where do you think you're going?
- To get my clothes.

854
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,565
- Got your discharge?
- My what?

855
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,331
- Your release.
- I'm all right. Let me out.

856
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,809
- Get back there. Go on.
- Keep your hands off me!

857
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,644
Birnam?

858
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,529
Come here, Birnam.

859
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,531
Is this a jail?

860
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,167
This department's
a halfway hospital, halfway jail.

861
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,567
Listen, Bim.
In my clothes, there's five dollars.

862
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,047
That's all for you, if only
you won't send that postcard.

863
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,731
- Nothing doing.
- I don't want anybody to know.

864
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,286
Your folks might as well
get used to our little postcards.

865
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,687
- What are you talking about?
- There'll be more of 'em.

866
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,451
- You'll be back.
- Oh, shut up!

867
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,011
Listen. I can pick an alkie
with one eye shut.

868
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,806
You're an alkie.
You'll come back. They all do.

869
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,931
Him, for instance. Shows up
every month, just like the gas bill.

870
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,170
And the one with the glasses.
Another repeater. His 45th trip.

871
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,442
Big executive
in the advertising business.

872
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,167
Lovely fellow.
Been coming here since 1927.

873
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,001
Good old Prohibition days.
Say, you should've seen the joint then.

874
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,124
This is nothing. Back then,
we really had a turnover.

875
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,049
Standing room only.

876
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,369
Prohibition, that's what
started most of these guys off.

877
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,608
Now, be a good boy and drink this.

878
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,166
- I don't want it.
- Better take it.

879
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,965
Liable to be a little floor show
later on around here.

880
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,487
- Might get on your nerves.
- Floor show?

881
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,682
- Ever have the DTs?
- No.

882
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,643
- You will, brother.
- Not me.

883
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,889
Like to make a little bet?
After all, you're just a freshman.

884
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,402
Wait till you're a sophomore.
That's when you start seeing animals.

885
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,842
You know that stuff about
pink elephants? That's the bunk.

886
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,090
It's little animals,
little tiny turkeys in straw hats.

887
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,283
Midget monkeys
coming through the keyholes.

888
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,166
See that guy over there?
With him, it's beetles.

889
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,204
Come the night, he sees beetles
crawling all over him.

890
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,409
Has to be dark, though.

891
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,091
It's like the doctor
was just telling me,

892
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,846
"Delirium is a disease of the night."

893
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,450
Good night.

894
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,244
Get the restraints and the doctor!

895
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,282
Get him up to the violent ward.

896
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,684
Over here, Doctor.

897
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,122
Violent ward. Get the elevator.

898
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,889
- Good morning.
- Shh.

899
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,446
Anything wrong up there?
Anything wrong?

900
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,970
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

901
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,570
Have you been there all night?

902
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,848
- I've been waiting for Mr Birnam.
- Mr Don Birnam?

903
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,962
Yes, I suppose he stayed overnight
with friends.

904
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,880
- He has friends in Long Island.
- What kind of story's that?

905
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,480
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm his landlady.

906
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,171
I know what goes on in this house.
I know Mr Don Birnam.

907
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,006
I knew all about him the first week
they moved here five years ago.

908
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,202
Heard those bottles
rattle in the garbage can.

909
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,210
I know all about you.
You're Helen St James.

910
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,244
You're working on "Time Magazine",
and you're his best girl.

911
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:44,160
I also know he's not staying
with any friends in Long Island.

912
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,806
He's off on another toot,
and you know I'm darned right.

913
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,928
Now, come on down,
and I'll make you some breakfast.

914
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,371
I don't care for breakfast,

915
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,370
nor for that kind of talk,
even supposing you're right.

916
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,641
Which I am!

917
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,122
I could've kicked him out 50 times,
the last when two taxi drivers

918
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,561
dumped him into the entrance hall
out cold on the floor

919
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,523
with all my tenants
going in and out

920
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,165
and children leaving for school!

921
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,487
- Please!
- Well, I didn't put him out.

922
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,568
Not as long as his brother
could pay the rent.

923
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,047
You couldn't help liking him anyway,
he was so good looking.

924
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,130
He had such nice manners.
He always had a little joke.

925
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,681
Stop talking about him
as if he were dead.

926
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,962
Best thing for you if he was!

927
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,564
I want a quarter rye, quick.

928
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,848
- OK if I take off my coat?
- No!

929
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,685
No cracks. No questions.
Just a quarter rye.

930
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,128
- It'll be $2.15.
- Come on. I need that liquor.

931
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,925
I want it, and I'm going to get it,
understand?

932
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,324
I'm going to walk out with that
quarter rye, one way or another.

933
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,609
Miss St James?
He's back. He's upstairs.

934
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,167
This is Mrs Deveridge.
Yes, he's back up in his apartment.

935
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,930
I heard him yelling.

936
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,444
Don, open the door. Please.

937
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,170
Don, won't you let me in? I know
you're there. Please open the door.

938
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,086
Don, don't you hear me?
I want to help you.

939
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,721
Don, I won't go away.
Do I have to go down

940
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,127
and get the janitor
with the passkey to let me in?

941
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,771
Dave? Dave!

942
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,326
- Yes, Mrs Deveridge?
- Come on up with the passkey.

943
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,885
Come on. Come on.

944
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,727
- Thank you very much.
- You'd better let us come too.

945
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,844
- You can't go in there alone.
- I'll be all right. Thank you.

946
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,769
Come, Sophie. Let's go.

947
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,361
- Don, darling.
- Go away, Helen.

948
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,290
- I'm here to help you, darling.
- No, no.

949
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,324
Look at you.

950
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,967
You want to get up, Don.
Put your arm on my shoulder.

951
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,562
You'll have a bath,
and I'll help you shave,

952
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,245
and you'll eat and sleep,

953
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:00,206
and when Wick comes back,
everything will be all right.

954
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,049
No, Helen! Don't!

955
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,766
- What's the matter?
- That wall.

956
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,611
- What wall?
- The mouse and the bat.

957
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,042
- "The mouse and the bat"?
- That hole in the wall behind you.

958
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,642
- There's no hole in the wall.
- Yes, there is.

959
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:21,288
No, there isn't.
Don, please look for yourself. Come on.

960
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,482
Come on, Don. Please look.

961
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,765
See?

962
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,082
Everything's going to be all right.
I'll stay right with you.

963
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:49,000
It's little animals,
it's always little animals.

964
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,043
That's what Bim said.

965
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,561
You're not making much sense, Don.

966
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,001
You know what Nat said
about the ending?

967
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,210
Like this...

968
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,206
<i>...or</i> like that.

969
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,085
Like this or like that.

970
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,529
Don! Don!

971
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,446
Where are you going, Don? Don?

972
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,281
- All right, give me the pawn ticket.
- No scene, please.

973
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,044
Just give me the ticket.

974
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,447
I don't want you to go in and
claim it now. It would look queer.

975
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,369
You're ashamed of what
the pawnbroker thinks, is that it?

976
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,926
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Wick'll get you back your coat.

977
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,442
You couldn't have taken my bracelet
or my pay cheque? It had to be that!

978
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,643
The one that brought us together?
Stop being sentimental.

979
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,843
I have, Don. I assure you.
It's finished. It's dead.

980
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,684
For three years,
they couldn't talk me out of you.

981
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,928
I was the only one that
really understood you.

982
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,611
I knew there was a core
of something. Well, there is.

983
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,087
And now I know what it is:
a sponge.

984
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,443
To soak it full, you'll do anything
that's ruthless, selfish, dishonest.

985
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,528
- I asked you not to make a scene.
- Then give me the ticket.

986
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,603
- Not now. Please.
- I don't want the money!

987
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,007
You can get as drunk as you like,
for all I care!

988
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,088
Thank you.

989
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,645
A gentleman came in a while ago.
How much did you give him for that?

990
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,808
- Why?
- I want it back. It's my coat.

991
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,684
- It's your coat?
- It's all right. He had permission.

992
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,768
- How much did you give him?
- He didn't want any money.

993
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,281
- He wanted to swap it.
- Swap it? For what?

994
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,970
Something he hocked here
a long while back.

995
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,606
- What?
- A gun.

996
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,005
<i>A gun.</i>

997
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,248
Now, if you want the coat back,
I can...

998
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,169
What is it, Helen?

999
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,409
What's the matter?

1000
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,770
Nothing.

1001
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,486
Dave gave me the keys.
I didn't think you were here.

1002
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,283
What do you want here?

1003
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,801
The rain is worse
and I couldn't get a taxi.

1004
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,367
I thought I could borrow a coat
under the circumstances.

1005
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,051
Sure. How about my raincoat?

1006
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,288
Funny that we should wind up
after all these years just as we met.

1007
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,085
- I with your raincoat.
- And I with your leopard coat.

1008
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,725
I always get the best
of the bargain.

1009
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,683
Goodbye, Helen.

1010
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,844
- What are you looking for?
- I thought perhaps...

1011
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,162
maybe you might
have something for my hair.

1012
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,046
- Would you care to wear my derby?
- Any old thing. Any old scarf.

1013
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,685
All right.

1014
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,041
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1015
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,810
So long.

1016
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,289
There was some whiskey left
in the bottle after I cleaned up.

1017
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,562
- Was there?
- Like to know where I put it?

1018
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,011
Nope.

1019
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,367
- Don't you want a drink, Don?
- No.

1020
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,043
Here it is. Right here.
Why don't you have one? Just one.

1021
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,810
What are you up to?

1022
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,367
Nothing. I'm just ashamed
of the way I talked to you,

1023
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,723
like a narrow-minded, insensitive,
small-town teetotaller.

1024
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,842
I told you I don't feel like a drink.
Not now.

1025
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,361
Come on, Don. Just one.
I'll have one with you.

1026
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,522
I'm in no hurry.
This is my easy day at the office.

1027
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:21,042
Helen, there are a few things I want
to put in order before Wick comes.

1028
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,401
Let me stay. Please.

1029
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,329
No.

1030
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,361
I don't want to sound rude,
but I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.

1031
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,566
- Here, Don.
- You're very sweet.

1032
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,124
Good bye.

1033
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,046
- Don't let me bend for nothing.
- You need this, Don. Drink it.

1034
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,642
I want you to drink it. I'll get you more.
I'll get you all you want.

1035
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,203
- What kind of talk is that?
- I'd rather you be drunk than dead.

1036
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,890
- Who wants to be dead?
- Stop lying to me.

1037
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,245
Give it to me!

1038
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,562
All right. Now, go.
No fuss, please.

1039
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,001
And don't call the neighbours.
It won't do any good, I promise you.

1040
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,606
I won't.
You've made up your mind.

1041
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,563
But could you tell me why? Why?

1042
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,251
'Cause it's best for everybody:
for you, for Wick and for me.

1043
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,048
- But that's not true. We love you.
- Then for me. Selfish again.

1044
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,003
That's a sad final word, Don.

1045
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,009
Look at it this way,
this business is a formality -

1046
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,610
Don Birnam is dead already.

1047
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,366
- He died over this weekend.
- Did he? What did he die of?

1048
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,484
A lot of things. Of alcohol.
Of moral anaemia.

1049
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:41,248
- Of fear, shame, DTs!
- Oh, <i>that</i> Don Birnam!

1050
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,522
- And now you want to kill the other?
- What other?

1051
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:46,610
Don the drunk and Don the writer.

1052
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,770
Let's not go back to a fancy figure
of speech. There's only one Don.

1053
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,968
He's through.

1054
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,526
I'm all right.
I still have enough strength left.

1055
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,803
I know you have. I can see it.
Don't waste it by pulling a trigger.

1056
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,365
Let me get it over with.

1057
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,801
Or do you want me to give
another promise I can't keep?

1058
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,200
I don't want your promise.

1059
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,846
I don't want you to give your promise
to anybody but Don Birnam.

1060
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,042
It's too late!
I wouldn't know how to start!

1061
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,370
The only way to start is to stop.
There is no cure besides stopping.

1062
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,528
- Can't be done.
- Other people have stopped.

1063
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,762
People with a purpose,
with something to do!

1064
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,611
- But you've got talent and ambition!
- Talent! Ambition!

1065
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,802
That's dead long ago.
That's drowned.

1066
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,969
That's drifting around like
a bloated belly in a lake of alcohol.

1067
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,003
No, it isn't.
You still have it.

1068
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,088
Quit trying to stall me, Helen.
It's too late.

1069
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,720
There's no more writing left in me.
What do you expect? A miracle?

1070
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,604
Yes! If I could just make you <i>un...</i>

1071
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,289
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr Birnam.

1072
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,847
- What is it, Nat?
- I got something for you.

1073
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,890
- I hope I ain't intrudin'.
- What is it?

1074
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,290
You know when you had that accident?

1075
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,165
Afterward, I found this floating
around on the Nile.

1076
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,169
She writes good.
I oiled her up a little.

1077
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,647
And I didn't oil her up
so you can hock her.

1078
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,968
- I'll take it, Nat.
- Hello, miss.

1079
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,082
- Thank you, Nat.
- How are them lilacs in Ohio?

1080
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,086
Well, Don, here it is.
What do you say now?

1081
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,083
- Say about what?
- This.

1082
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,244
Someone somewhere sent it back. Why?
Because he means you to stay alive.

1083
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,931
Because he wants you to write.
I didn't ask for a big miracle.

1084
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,560
Write with these hands
and a brain that's all out of focus?

1085
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,170
It'll clear up again.

1086
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,886
And I'll be sitting there staring
at that white sheet, scared.

1087
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,765
No, you won't. You've forgotten
what it feels like to be well.

1088
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,447
- What am I going to write about?
- What you've always wanted.

1089
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:39,327
- Where was the page I found?
- "The Bottle". A novel by Don Birnam.

1090
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,727
- What was that to be?
- About a messed-up life.

1091
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,649
About a man and a woman
and a bottle.

1092
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,922
About nightmares, horrors,
humiliations...

1093
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,610
all the things
I want to forget.

1094
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,848
Put it all down on paper.
Get rid of it that way.

1095
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,883
"To whom it may concern."

1096
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,322
- And it concerns so many people.
- Yeah.

1097
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,482
I'll fix us some breakfast.

1098
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,766
We have quite a supply of milk.

1099
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,968
You'll notice
I didn't even find the first line.

1100
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,050
You couldn't write the beginning
because you didn't know the ending.

1101
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,969
<i>Only, now...</i>

1102
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,209
Only, now you know the ending.

1103
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,528
I'm going to send one copy to Bim,

1104
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,688
one to the doctor
who loaned me his coat,

1105
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,121
and one to Nat.

1106
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,005
Imagine Wick
standing in front of a bookstore.

1107
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:48,882
Great, big pyramid of books,
and a novel by Don Birnam.

1108
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,644
"That's by my brother, you know."

1109
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:53,445
"That's by my fellow.
Didn't I always tell you?"

1110
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,530
I'm gonna put this whole weekend down
minute by minute.

1111
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,880
Why not?

1112
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,083
The way I stood in there
packing my suitcase.

1113
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,771
Only, my mind wasn't
on the suitcase.

1114
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,928
It wasn't on the weekend.

1115
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,090
Nor was it on the shirts I was
putting in the suitcase, either.

1116
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,010
'My mind was hanging
outside the window.

1117
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:16,806
'It was suspended
just about 18 inches below.

1118
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,964
'And out there in that
great, big concrete jungle

1119
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,811
'I wonder how many others
there are like me

1120
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,129
'poor, bedevilled guys
on fire with thirst

1121
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,241
'such comical figures
to the rest of the world

1122
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:35,924
'as they stagger blindly towards another
binge another bender, another spree.'
