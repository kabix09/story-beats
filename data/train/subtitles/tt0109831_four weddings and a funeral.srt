in these wretched lineups.

163
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,211
- It's a cinch, give a big, warm hug

164
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,338
and say the bride looks pregnant.

165
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,172

166
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,549

183
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,716
- Uh, you want one of these?

184
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,852
- [Carrie] Oh, thank you.

185
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,594
- Um, I--

186
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,137
- [John] Hello, Charles.

187
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,149
- Hello, dear John, how
are you, how are you?

188
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,308
Good, good.

189
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,184
This is, um--

190
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,018
- Carrie.

191
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,103
- Carrie.
- Delighted, I'm John.

192
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,020
- [Carrie] Hi, John.

193
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,898
(all chuckle)

194
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,817
- So John, how's that
gorgeous girlfriend of yours?

195
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,151
- She's no longer my girlfriend.

196
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,737
- Ah, dear, still I wouldn't
get too gloomy about it,

197
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,614
rumor had it she never stopped
bonking old Toby de Lisle,

198
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,251
just in case you didn't work out.

199
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,378
- She is now my wife.

200
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,415
- Excellent, excellent, congratulations.

201
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,467
- [Carrie] Excuse me.

202
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,721
- Any kids or anything, John?

203
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,225
Do we hear the patter of tiny feet?

204
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,602
No.

205
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,804
Well, there's plenty of
time for that, isn't there?

206
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,606
No, uh, no hurry.

207
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,115
(grunts)

208
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,993
Hi, how are you?

209
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,959
- My name's Fiona.

210
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,512
- Um, I'm Gerald.

211
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,797
- [Fiona] What do you do?

212
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,758
I'm training to be a priest.

213
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,468
- Good lord!

214
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,136
Do you do weddings?

215
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,556
- No, no, not yet, I
will, though, of course.

216
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,849
Jolly nerve-racking.

217
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,111
- Yes, rather like the
first time one has sex.

218
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,898
- Um, well, well, I suppose so.

219
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,857
- Though rather less messy, of course.

220
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,327
And far less call for condoms.

221
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,956
(Gerald giggles)

222
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,012
- Who's that boy over there in the gray?

223
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,014
- [Matthew] His name's David.

224
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,609
- Something of a dish, isn't he?

225
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,237
- Well, I've always thought so.

226
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,396
- [Serena] Why are they, um?

227
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,814
- Oh, the dish can't hear.

228
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:49,616
- Oh!

229
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,234
Gosh.

230
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,946
- Yeah, silent, but deadly attractive.

231
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,489
(gong bangs)

232
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,241
- Bang, bang, bang, that's right.

233
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,535
Into the marquee, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

234
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,921
Dinner is served.

235
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,164
- How do you do?

236
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,719
- Hello, Tom, splendid to
meet you, very exciting.

237
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,942
- Hi.

238
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,018
My name's Scarlett.

239
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,614
Don't let me drink too much,
'cause I'll get really flirty.

240
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,244
- How do you do, my name is Charles.

241
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,915
- Don't be ridiculous,
Charles died 20 years ago.

242
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,659
- Must be a different Charles, I think.

243
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,786
- Are you telling me I
don't know my own brother?

244
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:45,672
- [Charles] No, no.

245
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,604
(glass clinks)

246
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,472
- Ladies and gentlemen,

247
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,859
I'm sorry to drag you from
your delicious desserts.

248
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,560
There are just one or two little things

249
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,896
I feel I should say as best man.

250
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,274
This is only the second time
I've ever been a best man.

251
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,984
I hope I did the job all right that time.

252
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,320
The couple in question are
at least still talking to me.

253
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,989
(guests laugh)

254
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,910
Unfortunately, they're not
actually talking to each other.

255
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,579
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.

256
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,123
(guests laugh)

257
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,928
But I'm assured it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

258
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,087
Apparently, Paula knew
that Pierce had slept

259
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,215
with her younger sister before
I mentioned it in the speech.

260
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,769
(guests laugh)

261
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,930
The fact that he slept with
her mother came as a surprise

262
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,903
but I think was incidental to
the nightmare of recrimination

263
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:54,533
and violence that became
their two-day marriage.

264
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,983
Anyway, enough of that.

265
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,610
My job today is to talk about Angus.

266
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,583
And there are no skeletons in
his cupboard or so I thought.

267
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,742
- [Guests] Ooh!

268
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,576
- I'll get to that in a minute.

269
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,380
I would just like to say this,

270
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,138
I am, as ever, in bewildered awe

271
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,800
of anyone who makes
this kind of commitment

272
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,812
that Angus and Laura have made today.

273
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,429
I know I couldn't do it,

274
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,527
and I think it's wonderful they can.

275
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,229
So anyway, back to Angus and those sheep.

276
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,534
(all laugh and applaud)

277
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,362
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses,

278
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,030
the adorable couple.

279
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,751
- [All] Yes, the adorable couple!

280
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,914
(all cheer and applaud)

281
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,385
- [Man] Get one for me, Angus!

282
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,889

(both laugh)

301
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,357
She's a pretty girl.

302
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,691
The one you can't take your eyes off.

303
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,952
Is it love at first sight?

304
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,030
- Oh, good lord, no, no, uh, it's the um,

305
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,615
it's the bloke she's dancing with.

306
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,824
I used to play rugby with him at school.

307
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,836
I'm just trying to remember
what position he played in.

308
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,082
Though, let's say one,
for the sake of argument,

309
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:20,168
one did take a fancy to
someone at a wedding.

310
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,629
I mean, do you think
there really are people

311
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,964
who can just go up and say,
hi, babe, my name's Charles,

312
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,267
this is your lucky night?

313
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,637
- Well, if there are, they're not English.

314
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,439
- Well, quite.

315
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,985
Three weeks is about my
question-popping minimum.

316
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,854
- You know I love you, Jean, don't you?

317
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,023
I love you, I love you.

318
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,360
And Mike, I've never met you before

319
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,205
but I love you very much, I really do.

320
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,614
- [Woman] Silly girl.

321
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,908
- Ignore her, she's drunk.

322
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,378
At least I hope she is.

323
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,922
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.

324
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,291
- How's it going, Lyds?

325
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,710
- Bloody awful.

326
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,796
- Oh, dear, what's the problem?

327
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,340
- I was promised sex.

328
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,174
Everybody said it,

329
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,093
you be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.

330
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,303
You'll be fighting them off.

331
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,400
But not so much as a tongue in sight.

332
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,821
- Well, I mean, if you fancy anything.

333
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,356
I could always--

334
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,567
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Bernard.

335
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,026
I'm not that desperate.

336
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,655
- No, right, of course, fair enough.

337
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,499
It's a good point.

338
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,754

339
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,432
(sheep bleats)

340
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,759
- [Woman] Bye!

341
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,636
- Bye, have a lovely, lovely time!

342
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,929

343
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,732

staying tonight, Charles?

351
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,383
- Oh, Scarlett and I are at some pub,

352
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,886
The Lucky Boat, something like that.

353
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,471
Aren't we all?

354
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,016
- Ah no, slight change of plan.

355
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,101
The others are, in fact,
coming back to my place.

356
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,770
Nancy's in residence, might knock us up

357
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,147
a quick plate of eggs and bacon
over a late-night Scrabble.

358
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,909
I wondered if you'd like to join.

359
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,068
- Oh, yeah, that would be great.

360
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,110
Thanks very much.

361
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,695
Is there room for Scarlett?

362
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,324
- Oh, absolutely, 137 rooms actually.

363
00:22:56,334 --> 00:23:00,551
- (chuckles) Tommy, are you
the richest man in England?

364
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:05,760
- Oh, no, no, I believe
we're about seventh.

365
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,629
The queen, obviously.

366
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,381
- [Charles] That's right.

367
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,518
- That Branson bloke's
doing terribly well.

368
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,979
Well, excellent news.

369
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,013
I'll go tell Scarlett.

370
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,223
- [Charles] Yeah.

371
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,986
- That's unless you get lucky first.

372
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,688
- [Man] Forget about it!

373
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,909
Get out, get out, go on,
all right then go on.

374
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,703
- [Carrie] Hi.

375
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,281
- Hi, hi, I thought you'd gone.

376
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,449
- No, not yet, I was just wondering

377
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,961
where you were staying tonight.

378
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,373
- Well, I was staying at some pub called

379
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,376
The Lucky Boat or something like--

380
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,304
- [Carrie] Boatman.

381
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,755
- Right, but now I'm gonna stay

382
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,634
at some friend's house with some friends.

383
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,137
Well, I say house, I
think enormous castle is

384
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,638
a more accurate description.

385
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,974
- That's too bad 'cause
I'm at The Boatman.

386
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:03,776
- Oh.

387
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:09,282
- Well, it was nice not quite meeting you.

388
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,734
It was a great speech.

389
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,536
- Thanks.

390
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,658
- Well, I'm going now.

391
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,035
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

392
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,246
don't, don't go, we can meet now.

393
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,247
The evening's just getting going.

394
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,250

know that's a big lie.

Stop the car!

421
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,796
Sorry, sorry, I just think

422
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,799
I might stay in that pub after all.

423
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,592
- [Tom] Why on earth?

424
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,313
(all vocalizing)

425
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,811
- No, no, no, seriously,

426
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,439
I'm doing some research on pubs
with word boat in the title.

427
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,441
I hope to produce the definitive work.

428
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,359
- Oh, well, please yourself.

429
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,871
- It's a silly thing, you know?

430
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,586
Right.

431
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,466
Odd decision.

432
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:15,843
Hello.

433
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,044
- Hi.

434
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:18,846
- Hi.

435
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,214
In the end, it turned out

436
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,298
there wasn't room for all of us, so--

437
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,592
- You said it was a castle.

438
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,843
- No, it is a castle.

439
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,356
It's just a very, very small one.

440
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,100
Tiny, in fact, just one up,
one down, which is rare.

441
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,902
- Drink, sir?

442
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:37,313
- Yeah, I'd like a glass
of whiskey, please, thanks.

443
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,731
Do you want?

444
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,690
- Yeah, sounds good.

445
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,317
- [Charlie] And make
another one for the lady.

446
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,151
- Doubles, sir?

447
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,152
- [Charlie] Hm, thanks.

448
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:47,792
- (whistles) Ah, you here too, are you?

449
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,035
- Hello, I'm fine.

450
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,954
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?

451
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:53,788
- Who?

452
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,666
- Carrie, American girl, lovely legs,

453
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,427
wedding guest, nice smell.

454
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,837
- No, sorry.

455
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:05,268
- Damn, blast, I think I was in there.

456
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:07,844
Look if you do see her,

457
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,346
could you tell her I've
gone up to my room?

458
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,764
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,182
- Your whiskey, sir.

460
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,016
- Thank you.

461
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,268
- And one for the--

462
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,686
- Road, lovely.

463
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,396
- Actually, I think I
might have one those.

464
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,273
Do you mind if I join you?

465
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,691
- No, that'd be lovely.

466
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,277
- Another glass of whiskey and a cigar.

467
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,987
Hold on, make that a bottle of whiskey.

468
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,822
We might as well settle in, eh?

469
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,741
Let's see if we can push on
through till dawn, shall we?

470
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,826
Lovely wedding.

471
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,786
- [Charlie] Yes, yes, yes.

472
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,998
- I was at school with his
brother Bufty, tremendous bloke.

473
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,876
He was head of my house,
buggered me senseless.

474
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,461
Still, taught me a
thing or two about life.

475
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,337
- [Charlie] Mm.

476
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,765
- [George] Where you know him from?

477
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,924
- University.

478
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,730
- Mm, splendid, splendid, yep.

479
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,223
I didn't go myself, I
couldn't see the point.

480
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,225
You see, I mean when you're
working the money markets

481
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,728
what use are the novels of
Wordsworth gonna be, eh?

482
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,521
- Excuse me, sir, your wife says,

483
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,565
could you come upstairs at once?

484
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,276
Room 12, in case you're so
drunk you can't remember.

485
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,611
- My wife?

486
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,070
- Yes, sir.

487
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,323
- Oh, my wife, (laughs) my wife!

488
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,450
- My God, you are drunk,

489
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,035
you can't even remember you got a wife.

490
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,537
- Yeah, yeah, zzz (laughs).

491
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,622
Do you mind if I?

492
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,415
- No, no, off you go, off you go.

493
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,249
Best of luck.

494
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,083
- [Charlie] Thanks, yeah.

495
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:21,918
- Lucky bachelor me,

496
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,712
I'll think I'll have another
search for that Katie creature.

497
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:25,546
- Carrie.

498
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,475
- That's the one, damn fine filly.

499
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,561
I think I'm in there.

500
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:47,985
- [Carrie] Hi.

501
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,446
- Hello, sorry about that.

502
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,531
- No, that's fine, he
was hard to get rid of.

503
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,336
- Yeah, so, um,

504
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,917
(slow gentle music)

505
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,295
maybe we could just skulk
around here for a bit,

506
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,058
and then go back down.

507
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,051
- Now that's a thought.

508
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,553
I don't usually skulk a lot
but I suppose I could skulk

509
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,065
if skulking were required.

510
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,068
Do you skulk regularly?

511
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:24,063
- No, no, I don't normally think of myself

512
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,032
as a skulker, but, um.

513
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,613
- Well, why don't you come in

514
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,668
and skulk for a while and we'll see.

515
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,792
(door thuds)

516
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:48,421
So I noticed the bride and
groom didn't kiss in the church

517
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,047
just kind of strange.

518
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,268
Where I come from, kissing is very big.

519
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,593
- Is it?

520
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,428
Yes, well, I think you're right.

521
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,429
I think we are probably more reserved.

522
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,015
You know, and you may now kiss the bride,

523
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,600
isn't actually in the
book of common prayer.

524
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,311
- I always worry I'll go too far,

525
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,072
you know, in the heat of the moment.

526
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,666
- Uh huh, how far do you
think too far would be, then?

527
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,955
- Oh, I don't know.

528
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,000
Maybe,

529
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,620
that would be all right.

530
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,913
- Yeah, I think that would be fine.

531
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,009
- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.

532
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,429
Maybe this

533
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:31,724
would be better.

534
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,761
- Yeah, I think, I think
it would be dangerous

535
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:37,855
to take it any further.

536
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,026
I mean, um, you know.

537
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,375
That might be taking it a little far.

538
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,914
- [Carrie] What about this?

539
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,374
Do you think the vicar would think

540
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:09,960
things had slipped a
bit out of his control?

541
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,504
- [Charles] I think he might.

542
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,297
- This kind of thing
is really better suited

543
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:17,353
to the honeymoon than
to the service itself.

544
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,597
- Why do you think it's
called a honeymoon?

545
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,402
- [Charlie] Um, I don't
know, I suppose it's honey

546
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,229
'cause it's sweet as honey.

547
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:32,535
And moon because it was the first time

548
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,413
a husband got to see his wife's bottom.

549
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,380
(slow serene music)

550
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,539
What's happening?

551
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:21,750
- I have to go.

552
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,202
- [Charlie] Where?

553
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,005
- America.

554
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:29,925
- That is a tragedy.

555
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,429
- Just before I go,

556
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,974
when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?

557
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,893
- Huh?

558
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,814
Sorry, whose engagement?

559
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,058
- Ours, I assumed since we slept together,

560
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,029
and everything, we'd be getting married.

561
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:52,740
What did you think?

562
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,743
- What?

563
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,661
I, um,

564
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:03,042
gosh, you know, that, that's, um,

565
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,587
takes a lot of thinking
about that kind of thing.

566
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,215
Obviously, I'm, I'm, uh,

567
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,552
you're joking.

568
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,922
(Carrie laughs)

569
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,590
God, for a moment there,

570
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,383
I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.

571
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,427
I thought you were Glenn Close,

572
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,261
and I was gonna get home

573
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,731
and find my pet rabbit on the stove.

574
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,694
- Oh, no, but I think we've both missed

575
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,822
a great opportunity here.

576
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,487
Bye.

577
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,542
(slow subdued music)

578
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,723
(alarm clock rings)

579
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,437
(mid-tempo cheerful music)

580
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,400
- [Charles] Oh, fuck!

581
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:11,735
- Huh?

582
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,530
Fuck.

583
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,272
- [Charlie] Fuck.

584
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,773
Fuckity, fuck.

585
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:18,826
- Fuck, fuck!

586
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,360
Car or taxi?

587
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,705
- Taxi, we could never park.

588
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,632
Car seems a good idea.

589
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,302
- [Both] Fuck.

590
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,982
- Leave it, no one will notice.

591
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,434
(church bells ring)

592
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,154
- [Man] Sorry, madam.

593
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,293
(uptempo organ music)

594
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,341
- Well, sorry I'm late, traffic.

595
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,513
Yeah, who is it today?

596
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,747
- [Photographer] One more, please.

597
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,135
(uplifting organ music)

598
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:53,220
- In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

599
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,223
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

600
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,100
- [Wedding Guests] Amen.

601
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,236
- Let us pray.

602
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,355
Father, you have made the bond of marriage

603
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:08,328
a holy mystery, a symbol of
Christ's love for his church.

604
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,875
Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia

605
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:18,009
through your son, Jesus Christ our lord

606
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:22,676
who lives and reigns with
you and the Holy goat, ghost.

607
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:29,354
One God, forever and ever, amen.

608
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,760
- It's his first time, he's
a friend of the family.

609
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,011
- Ah, excellent.

610
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,096
- Bernard and Lydia,

611
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,973
I shall now ask if you freely

612
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,059
undertake the obligations of marriage.

613
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,229
Bernard, repeat after me,

614
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,648
I do solemnly declare.

615
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,650
- I do solemnly declare.

616
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,779
- [Gerald] That I know not
of any lawful impediment.

617
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,865
- That I know not of any lawful impediment

618
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,534
- Why I, Lydia.

619
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,254
- [Bernard] Why I, Bernard.

620
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:02,831
- Sorry.

621
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,791
(men laugh)

622
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:08,764
Why I, Bernard Godfrey Saint John Delaney.

623
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,521
- Why I, Bernard Geoffrey
St. John Delaney.

624
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:22,277
- May not be joined in
matrimony to Lydia John Hibbott.

625
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:27,324
- May not be joined in
matrimony to Lydia Jane Hibbott.

626
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:34,363
- Lydia repeat after me,

627
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,240
I do solemnly declare.

628
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,574
- I do solemnly declare

629
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,619
- [Gerald] That I know not
of any lawful impediment.

630
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,914
- That I know not of
any lawful impediment.

631
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:48,085
- Why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott.

632
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,213
- [Lydia] Why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott.

633
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,757
- May not be johned in matrimony.

634
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,719
- May not be joined in matrimony.

635
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,567
- To Bernard Geoffrey
(mumbles) John Delaney.

636
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:09,074
- [Lydia] To Bernard
Geoffrey St. John Delaney.

637
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,611
- [Gerald] I call upon those persons

638
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,072
here present to witness.

639
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,784
- I call upon those persons
here present to witness.

640
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,629
- That I, Bernard

641
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,971
Delaney.

642
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:36,008
- (sighs) That I, Bernard Delaney.

643
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:39,052
- Do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott.

644
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,180
- Do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott.

645
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,192
- To be my awful wedded wife.

646
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,770
- To be my lawful wedded wife.

647
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,856
- That's right, that's right.

648
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,483
May almighty God bless you all.

649
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,404
The Father, the Son and
the Holy spigot, Spirit.

650
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,655
- [Wedding Guests] Amen.

651
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,458
- Bravo!

652
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,826
- [Man] Bravo!

653
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:03,660
- [Man] Bravo!

654
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,662
(joyful organ music)

655
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:09,051
(wedding guests applaud)

656
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,305
- [Tom] Thanks.

657
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,139
We're coming, Bernie.

658
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,266
- Come here!

659
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:30,103
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

660
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,938
That way?

661
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:31,813
Yes, of course.

662
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,440
Sorry, could you two, um, thanks, sorry.

663
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,442
- [Woman] Tom, don't go away.

664
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,578
- [Tom] Sorry.

665
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,763
- I've got a new theory about marriage.

666
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,798
Two people are in love,
they live together,

667
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:01,635
and then suddenly one day
they run out of conversation.

668
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:02,469
- [Charlie] Uh huh.

669
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,595
- Totally, I mean, they can't think

670
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,514
of a single thing to say to each other.

671
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,651
That's it, panic.

672
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,827
Then suddenly it occurs
to the chap that there is

673
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,616
a way out of the deadlock.

674
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:17,401
- [Charlie] Which is?

675
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,403
- He'll ask her to marry him.

676
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,405
- [Charlie] Brilliant, brilliant!

677
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,239
- [Gareth] Suddenly, they've
got something to talk about

678
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:23,709
for the rest of their lives.

679
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,452
- Basically, you're saying
marriage is just a way

680
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,246
of getting out of an embarrassing
pause in conversation.

681
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:32,541
- Yep, the definitive icebreaker.

682
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,836
Tom, how's the speech coming along?

683
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,004
It's pretty good, I think.

684
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,766
Something for everyone, tears, laughter.

685
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,644
- (laughs) Excellent.

686
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,470
- Well, I think it's a
very good theory, Gareth.

687
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,014
- Well, there is another
argument, of course,

688
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,443
that it does have something
to do with true love.

689
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:51,903
- Well, there's a thought.

690
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,774
- [Bartender] Can I help you, sir?

691
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,818
- Can I have three
glasses of brandy, please?

692
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:01,153
- [Bartender] Certainly, sir.

693
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:01,955
- Hi.

694
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:05,490
- Hello.

695
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,658
- How are you?

696
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,128
- Fine, fine.

697
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:12,382
Yeah, sorry, I'm overwhelmed to see you.

698
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,460
Um, look, don't go back
to America, please.

699
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,712
I'll be back in two secs, okay?

700
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,514
- Okay.

701
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:22,684
- Hi, Fi.

702
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,218
That's yours and that's yours.

703
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,428
See you in five hours.

704
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,471
- [Gareth] Something happened?

705
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,358
- Yeah, has a bit, this is a
bloody great wedding, you know.

706
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,937
(grunts)

707
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,439
Hi.

708
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,107
Well, you look perfect.

709
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,276
You, in fact, you probably are perfect.

710
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,819
Well, how are you?

711
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,404
- I'm really well.

712
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,532
Charles, I'd like for you
to meet Hamish, my fiance.

713
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,994
(slow subdued music)

714
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,580
- Excellent, excellent.

715
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,290
How do you do, Hamish?

716
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,042
Pleasure to meet you.

717
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,794
Charming surprise to find
Carrie back in the country.

718
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,630
- Yes, well, it took a lot of
persuading, I can tell you.

719
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,508
Come on, darling, I told
James I was gonna get you.

720
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,342
He'll begin to think

721
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,728
I've totally lost control of you already.

722
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:08,647
- I'll see you later.

723
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,075
- How are you doing, Charles?

724
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,620
- Not great, actually, suddenly.

725
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:28,792
I don't know.

726
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:34,969
I mean, um, what the hell's going on here?

727
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:36,832
Why am I always at weddings

728
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,844
and never actually getting married, Matt?

729
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,546
- It's probably because
you're a bit scruffy.

730
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:43,348
- Yeah.

731
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,843
- Or it could also be 'cause
you haven't met the right girl.

732
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,646
- But you see, is that it?

733
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:51,805
Maybe I have met the right girls.

734
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,942
Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.

735
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,561
Maybe it's me.

736
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,645
- Nonsense.

737
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,951
- My lords, ladies, and
gentlemen, dinner is served.

738
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,664
- Come on, odds on you
meet your wife at dinner.

739
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,167
- Yes.

740
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,262
Oh, my God.

741
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,225
- Charles?

742
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,433
- Hi.

743
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,018
- [Alistair] Hello, I'm Alistair.

744
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:38,852
- [Charlie] Great.

745
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,353
- And I believe you know Veronica.

746
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,615
- Yeah, hi, Vee, hi.

747
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:43,575
Nicki, hi.

748
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,412
Great.

749
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,629
- [Woman In Hat] Tell me, are you married?

750
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,621
- No.

751
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,748
- [Woman In Hat] Are you a lesbian?

752
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:00,717
- Good lord!

753
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,127
Well, what made you say that?

754
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,838
- Well, it's one of the
possibilities for unmarried girls.

755
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,382
And it is a bit more
interesting than saying,

756
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,886
oh, dear, just never found
the right chap, eh (chuckles).

757
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,940
- Quite right, why be dull?

758
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:16,816
- Thank you.

759
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:24,522
- The truth is, the truth is
I have met the right person,

760
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,357
only he's not in love with me,

761
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,901
and until I stop loving
him, no one stands a chance.

762
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:30,237
- [Woman In Hat] Oh, bad luck.

763
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,039
- Yes, isn't it?

764
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,492
I was a lesbian once at school,

765
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,118
but only for about 15 minutes.

766
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,546
I don't think it counts.

767
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,589
- There are 400 different kinds of tea

768
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,968
and that's not including all
these so-called fruit teas.

769
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,095
I took Veronica out to India at Christmas

770
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,096
to look at the plantations.

771
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,180
- Oh, excellent.

772
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,266
- I believe you and her went there once.

773
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:00,308
- That's right.

774
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,434
- Charles was vile.

775
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,272
He insisted on cracking
jokes all the time I was ill.

776
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:06,231
- I was just trying to cheer you up, Vee.

777
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,108
- Oh, you're that Veronica!

778
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:09,077
- Which Veronica?

779
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,236
Charlie?

780
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,070
- Remember Bombay?

781
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,697
- When Charles and I were going out,

782
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:16,908
he told me he'd had
this interesting journey

783
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,369
around India with Vomiting Veronica.

784
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,538
I think that was it.

785
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:24,833
- I don't remember ever
mentioning it, maybe I did.

786
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,835
- Oh, come on, Charles.

787
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:29,462
I don't think I've been out
with anyone less discreet.

788
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,297
- Well, I think that's probably

789
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,048
a bit of an exaggeration, is it not?

790
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,550
- It is not.

791
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,428
- I remember you going on
about this girl, Helena was it?

792
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:38,096
Whose mother made a pass at you.

793
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,931
- I remember this!

794
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,349
You couldn't work out whether it would

795
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,643
be impolite not to accept her advances!

796
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:44,477
(all laugh)

797
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,729
- That's right!

798
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,397
Mrs. Piggy, Helena was Miss Piggy,

799
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:48,773
so her mother was Mrs. Piggy.

800
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,692
(all laugh)

801
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,610
- I think perhaps it was a, it was a--

802
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,914
- We've both lost a lot
of weight since then.

803
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,120
(claps)

804
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,506
- Ah, great, the speeches.

805
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,293
- My lords, ladies, and gentlemen

806
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,420
pray silence for the best man.

807
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,767
(wedding guests applaud)

808
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,450
- When Bernard told me he
was getting engaged to Lydia,

809
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:29,647
I congratulated him, because
all his other girlfriends

810
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,409
had been such complete dogs.

811
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,569
(Lydia laughs)

812
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,488
Although, may I say how delighted we are

813
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,573
to have so many of them here this evening.

814
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,326
(Gareth laughs)

815
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,578
I'm particularly delighted to see Camilla,

816
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,805
who many of you will probably
remember as the first person

817
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,886
Bernard asked to marry him.

818
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,256
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off.

819
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,894
(Gareth laughs)

820
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,387
And lucky for Lydia that she did.

821
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:03,024
(Gareth laughs)

822
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,824
- [Man Walking With Tom]
It's very disappointing.

823
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,611
- We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.

824
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,613
Apparently her fiance's awfully grand

825
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,041
and he owns half of Scotland.

826
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:21,991
How are you?

827
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,452
- Well, I'm stuck in
the wedding from hell.

828
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,506
Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.

829
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:28,832
Next thing you know,
I'll bump into Henrietta,

830
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:29,749
and the horror will be complete.

831
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,177
- [Henrietta] Hello, Charles.

832
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,555
- Hello, Hen, how are you?

833
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,880
(Henrietta sobs)

834
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,840
Oh, Hen, I--

835
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,716
- Why can't you leave her alone?

836
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,061
Haven't you hurt her enough?

837
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:46,015
- Excuse me, I think I'd better be

838
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,017
where other people are not.

839
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,322
(mid-tempo band music)

840
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:56,870
- Hello.

841
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:47,202
(women giggle)

842
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:48,036
- [Woman] She did not.

843
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,839
- [Woman] She did too.

844
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,856
- [Doorman] Taxi!

845
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,814
Good night, sir.

846
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,649
- [Carrie] Thanks.

847
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:18,775
- [Doorman] Thank you.

848
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:21,528
- [Carrie] (chuckles) Come on now.

849
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:26,501

00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:31,798

(Bernard speaks faintly)

854
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:58,616
(Bernard and Lydia groan and giggle)

855
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,336
- [Lydia] Oh, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

856
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,631
This is no fun, I want
to see my lovely husband!

857
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,937
(Bernard and Lydia grunt and groan)

858
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,293

- Have you got a boyfriend?

864
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,011
- Yes.

865
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:10,803
- What's his name?

866
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,774
- Dolph, he's good at table tennis.

867
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,141
What about you?

868
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,393
- No, afraid not.

869
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,780
- [Girl] Why not?

870
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,740
I don't know.

871
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,777
Because most of the blokes I fancy think

872
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,904
I'm stupid and pointless

873
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,999
and so they just bonk
me and then leave me.

874
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,836
And the kind of blokes that do
fancy me, I think are drips.

875
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,589
I can't be bothered to bank them

876
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,717
which does sort of leave me a bit nowhere.

877
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,512
- What's bonking?

878
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,433
- Well, it's kind of like table tennis

879
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,594
only with slightly smaller balls.

880
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,942
(Bernard and Lydia groan and giggle)

881
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:14,961
- So good!

882
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,966
I love my wife!

883
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,603
- [Lydia] And I love my husband!

884
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,266
- Do you think we'd
better be getting back?

885
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:42,493
- Or we could just wait a few
minutes and have another go.

886
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,658
- You naughty, naughty little rabbit.

887
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:53,750
- Found it.

888
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:02,175
- Charles, Charles, we must talk.

889
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,460
- Right, you're right.

890
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,013
- The thing is, Charlie,

891
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,756
I've spoken to lots of people about you.

892
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:10,590
- [Charlie] Oh, God.

893
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,218
- And everybody agrees you're
in real trouble, Charles.

894
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,094
- Am I?

895
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:15,928
- The thing is, you see,

896
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:19,682
you're sort of turning into
a kind of serial monogamist.

897
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:22,727
One girlfriend after another,
yet you'll never love anyone

898
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,312
'cause you never let them near you.

899
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:26,147
- On the contrary, Hen--

900
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,659
- You're affectionate to
them and sweet to them.

901
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:30,818
You were even sweet to me,

902
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,236
although you thought I was an idiot.

903
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,070
- [Charles] I did not.

904
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,783
- You did, I thought U2
was a type of submarine.

905
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:37,700
- Well, in a way you were right,

906
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,118
their music has a very naval quality.

907
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:43,080
- Be serious, Charles, you
must give people a chance.

908
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,166
You don't have to think,
I must get married.

909
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,293
But you mustn't start every
relationships thinking,

910
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,753
I mustn't get married.

911
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:49,754
- [Charles] Hen, you
know, most of the time

912
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:50,588
I don't think at all.

913
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:53,299
I, I just, you know, putter along.

914
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,967
- Oh, Charlie!

915
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,730
Oh, God, the way you used to look at me!

916
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,182
I just misread it, that's all.

917
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,684
All that time I thought
you were going to propose

918
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,562
and all that time you were
just working out how to leave.

919
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,606
- [Charlie] No, no, I wasn't.

920
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,691
- [Henrietta] Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

921
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:11,526
- [Charles] Hen--

922
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:12,360
- [Hen] No.

923
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,194
- No, Hen, Hen.

924
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:14,028
- [Henrietta] No!

925
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:14,987
- Hen?
- No.

926
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,323
- [Carrie] Having a good night?

927
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:20,743
- Yes, yes, it's right up
there with my father's funeral

928
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,213
for sheer entertainment value.

929
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,789
I thought you'd gone.

930
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,583
- No, Hamish has to take
the Edinburgh sleeper.

931
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,554
I'm off now, keep me company?

932
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:44,767
(tapping on window)

933
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:45,820
Here, please.

934
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,282
You wanna come up for a nightcap?

935
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,693
- You sure?

936
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:55,778
- Well, yes, I think we can risk it.

937
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,280
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.

938
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,374
You're not that cute.

939
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,211
- Sorry, yeah, great.

(slow delicate music)

941
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,027
- Morning, Charles.

942
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:18,913
Breakfast's up.

943
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,832
Well, it's a bit burnt.

944
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,367
- [Charlie] Excellent.

- Oh, yeah.

948

I'm, uh, well, I'm taking
advantage of the fact that

949
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,837
for the first time in my
entire life it's Saturday

950
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,798
and I don't have a wedding to go to.

951
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:40,851
All I have to do is not be late for David.

952
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,844
- I was gonna go for a job.

953
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,514
There's shop called Spank
that wants a sales assistant.

954
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:47,858
I think I'd be great.

955
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,685
They sell all this funny rubber stuff.

956
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:55,658
- Oh, no, another wedding
invitation and a list, lovely.

957
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:00,152
- I mean, they say rubber's
mainly for perverts.

958
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:03,572
I don't know why, I think
it's very practical, actually.

959
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:07,159
I mean, you spill anything
on it, and it just comes off.

960
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,996
I suppose that could be
why the perverts like it.

961
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:10,798
You all right?

962
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:17,430
Yeah, yeah, it's that girl, Carrie,

963
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,057
you remember the American.

964
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,604
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

965
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,398
Do you have the wedding list for Banks?

966
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,899
- Certainly, sir.

967
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,359
Lots of beautiful things for around

968
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,662
about the 1000 pound mark.

969
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:45,740
- Uh huh, what about things

970
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,419
around the sort of 50
pound mark, is there much?

971
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,870
- [Sales Assistant] Well, you could get

972
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,339
that pygmy warrior over there.

973
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:56,083
- [Charles] This, excellent (chuckles).

974
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,888
- If you could find someone
to chip in the other 3,950.

975
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,590
Or our carrier bags are 1.50 pound each.

976
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,268
Why don't you just get 33 of them?

977
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:09,231
- Yes, well, I think
I'll probably leave it.

978
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,651
Thanks very much, you've been very, um--

979
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,603
- What'd you get?

980
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,437
- Blimey!

981
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:17,271
(both laugh)

982
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,074
Well, I never.

983
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,036
Nothing yet. I'm just, you know, deciding.

984
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,944
- It's nice to see you.

985
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,748
- It's nice to see you.

986
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,751
- This present thing is great.

987
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,952
I should've gotten married years ago.

988
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,245
Did anybody go for the pygmy?

989
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,747
- The young man was thinking about it.

990
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:39,678
- Oh, no (laughs), just get me an ashtray.

991
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,340
Are you free for about a half-hour?

992
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,759
- Yeah, yeah, I'm supposed
to meet my brother,

993
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:49,053
but I can be a bit late.

994
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,971
- Oh good, come with me.

995
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,681
You have an important decision to make.

996
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,934
Now the crucial thing is
that you mustn't laugh.

997

heaven, oh, he was wonderful.

sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.

1058
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,441
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.

01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,129
- Suddenly, at 27, you make a mistake?

1069
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:13,090
- Well, yes, he kept screaming,
it was very off-putting.

1070
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,426
I nearly gave up on the whole thing,

1071
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:16,760
but Spencer changed my mind.

1072
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,972
That's 28, his father, 29.

1073
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:20,931
- His father?

1074
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,944
- Um, 30, ugh, 31, oh my God.

1075
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,998
32 was lovely.

1076
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:35,289
And then my fiance, that's 33.

1077
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:37,666
- Wow!

1078
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:43,412
So I came after your fiance?

1079
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:44,381
- No, you were 32.

1080
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:47,958
- Oh.

1081
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,210
- So there you go, less than Madonna,

1082
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,972
more than Princess Di, I hope.

1083
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,550
And how 'bout you, how
many have you slept with?

1084
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,469
- Christ, nothing like that many.

1085
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,721
I don't know what the fuck

1086
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:03,182
I've been doing with my time, actually.

1087
01:05:03,192 --> 01:05:04,767
Work probably, yeah,
that's it, work, work.

1088
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,695
I have been working late a lot.

1089
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:16,622
I wish I'd rung you,

1090
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,168
but then you never rang me.

1091
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,256
You ruthlessly slept with
me twice and never rang me.

1092
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,721
Oh, bollocks!

1093
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,307
Help me, please, please.

1094
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,739
Carrie, this is David, my brother.

1095
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:55,994
- Hi.

1096
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:14,294
- I was just telling him
about you marrying Hamish

1097
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,754
and he said it couldn't have
happened to a nicer fellow,

1098
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:16,682
so that's nice.

1099
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:22,928
Where are you doing it?

1100
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:23,897
- [Carrie] Scotland.

1101
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,864
- He says that's a beautiful place, hilly.

1102
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,691
- You should come to the wedding, too.

1103
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,359
I want many friends as possible to make up

1104
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,705
for the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.

1105
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:45,210
Well, you better go in, bye.

1106
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:47,077
Bye.

1107
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:47,880
- Bye.

1108
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,475
Fuck it.

1109
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,815
Um, look, sorry, sorry.

1110
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:20,652
I just, well, this is a
really stupid question,

1111
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,238
particularly in view of our
recent shopping excursion.

1112
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:27,326
But, I just wondered if by any chance,

1113
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:31,163
um, I mean obviously not,
because I'm just some git

1114
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,414
who's only slept with nine people.

1115
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,719
But I just wondered, I really feel,

1116
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:40,307
in short, to recap in a
slightly clearer version

1117
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,551
in the words of David Cassidy, in fact,

1118
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,887
while he was with The Partridge Family,

1119
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,180
I think I love you.

1120
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:53,111
And I just wondered whether by any chance

1121
01:07:53,362 --> 01:07:54,186
you wouldn't like to, um,

1122
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:57,032
uh,

1123
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,078
no, no, no, of course not.

1124
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,322
I'm an idiot, he's not.

1125
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,533
Excellent, excellent,
fantastic, obviously.

1126
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:08,534
Lovely to see you.

1127
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:10,462
Sorry to disturb, better get on, fuck.

1128
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,081
- That was very romantic.

1129
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:17,668
(slow tender music)

1130
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:18,669
- Well, I thought it over a lot.

1131
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:20,514
You know, I wanted to get it just right.

1132
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,352
Important to have said it, I think.

1133
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,522
- Said what, exactly?

1134
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:35,779
- Said you know, what I just
said about David Cassidy.

1135
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:42,869
- You're lovely.

1136
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:38,665
- It was ordained for lifelong

1137
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,876
faithful relationship of conjugal love.

1138
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:45,005
It was ordained for the
welfare of human society

1139
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,965
which can be strong and happy

1140
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:49,853
only when the marriage
bond is held in honor.

1141
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:55,776
Into this holy estate these two
persons now desire to enter.

1142
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,312
Wherefore if anyone
can show any just cause

1143
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:03,899
why they may not lawfully be
joined together in marriage

1144
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,984
let him now declare it.

1145
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,455
(door clangs)

1146
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,124
- Sorry.

1147
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,085
- [Vicar] Please rise.

1148
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:20,082
Do you, Hamish take this woman, Caroline,

1149
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,250
to be your wedded wife?

1150
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,169
And do you, in the presence of God

1151
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,296
and before this congregation

1152
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,757
promise and covenant to be to her,

1153
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:30,842
a loving and faithful husband

1154
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,054
until God shall separate you by death?

1155
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:34,856
- [Hamish] I do.

1156
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,767
- [Vicar] Do you, Caroline
take this man, Hamish,

1157
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,644
to be your wedded husband?

1158
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,479
And do you, in the presence of God

1159
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,356
and before this congregation

1160
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:46,191
promise and covenant to be to him

1161
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,276
a loving and faithful wife

1162
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,987
until God shall separate you by death?

1163
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:51,822
- I do.

1164
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:54,449
- [Vicar] As a token of the covenant.

1165
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,534
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

1166
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:58,328
- [Vicar] These rings
are given and received

1167
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:00,414
by these signs you take each other.

1168
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:04,219
(traditional Scottish music)

1169
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:22,936
- How awfully nice to meet you.

1170
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,489
- Nice to meet you.

1171
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:26,815
How do you do?

1172
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:27,774
- How do you do?

1173
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:28,608
- Hello.

1174
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,411
- Fred.

1175
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,238
- You look beautiful.

1176
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:34,281
Not a meringue in sight.

1177
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,083
- Thanks.

1178
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,175
- [Charles] Blimey.

1179
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,084
- It's Brigadoon.

1180
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,888
It's bloody Brigadoon!

1181
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:02,267
Dear old things, as you
know, I've always been proud

1182
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:05,187
there isn't a wedding ring
between the lot of us.

1183
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:06,980
Over the passing of years,

1184
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,483
it's suddenly beginning to distress me.

1185
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:10,484
I'd like to go to the wedding

1186
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:13,445
of someone I really loved, for a change.

1187
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,404
- Well, don't blame me,

1188
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,907
I've asked practically everyone I know.

1189
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,658
- You haven't asked me.

1190
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,493
- Haven't I?

1191
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:20,327
- No.

1192
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:22,954
- Oh, Scarlett, would you like to?

1193
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,665
- No, thank you, it was
very nice of you to ask.

1194
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,927
- Well, anytime.

1195
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,212
- Quite right, Tom, that's the spirit.

1196
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:33,757
Now, tonight, these are your orders,

1197
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,984
go forth and conjugate,
find husbands and wives.

1198
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,971
- Excellent plan, what do you think, Fifi?

1199
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,640
Spot a potential hubby in the throng?

1200
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:42,974
- Bugger off, Tom.

1201
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,309
- Quite right.

1202
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:46,571
- A toast before we go into battle

1203
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:51,993
True love, in whatever
shape or form it may come.

1204
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,196
May we all in our dotage be proud to say

1205
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,740
I was adored once too.

1206
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,450
(all laugh)

1207
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,327
- [All] True love.

1208
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:05,632
(uptempo lively music)

1209
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,672
- Apparently, an enormous number of people

1210
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:17,217
actually bump into their
future spouses at weddings.

1211
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,094
Which is interesting.

1212
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:21,513
- Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.

1213
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:22,315
- Ah.

1214
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:31,439
Good lord, I seem to
have finished my drink.

1215
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,409
If you'll excuse me.

1216
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:42,200
- Hello, my name's Scarlett.

1217
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,328
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.

1218
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,997
What's your name?

1219
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,665
- My name's Rhett.

1220
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:51,459
- No, not really!

1221
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,421
- No, not really, in fact, it's Chester.

1222
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,515
- You kidder (laughs),

1223
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,260
I always imagine Americans
are gonna be dull as shit.

1224
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,512
I mean, of course you're not, are you?

1225
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,682
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?

1226
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:06,818
- Yes, he is.

1227
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:08,904
- You're lovely.

1228
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:12,949
- [Woman] Come on!

1229
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:20,040
- Hello, Charles.

1230
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,376
- Oh, Hen, hi.

1231
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,120
Look, I'm sorry, I couldn't
really bear a scene today.

1232
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,080
I know, you know, we probably
got tons to talk about,

1233
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,373
and all that kind of stuff--

1234
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,469
- Did I behave that atrociously last time?

1235
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,879
- Well, you remember the
shower scene in Psycho?

1236
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,255
- Yeah.

1237
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:38,214
- Scarier.

1238
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,008
(both laugh)

1239
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,551
Oh, God, I'm depressed, Hen, how are you?

1240
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,971
- I'm cheerful, actually,
I weigh almost nothing.

1241
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,775
And I've got a divine new boyfriend.

1242
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,478
- Perhaps you were right, Hen,
perhaps we should've married.

1243
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:52,312
- Good God, no, marry you

1244
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:54,439
and I'd have had to marry your friends.

1245
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:57,108
And I'm not quite sure I could take Fiona.

1246
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,860
- Fiona loves you.

1247
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,246
- Fiona calls me duck face.

1248
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,198
- Well, I never heard that.

1249
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,741
- Look, darling, come to lunch soon.

1250
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,201
Give me a ring, okay?

1251
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,420
Oh, still cute!

1252
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,834
- How's duck face?

1253
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,753
- Good form, actually, not too mad.

1254
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:18,713
(traditional Scottish music)

1255
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:22,310
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom.

1256
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:31,444
(guests applaud)

1257
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,810
- You like this girl, don't you?

1258
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:06,938
- Yes.

1259
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:14,352
Yes, it's a, it was a strange thing

1260
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,688
when at last it happens.

1261
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:20,243
And, huh, she's marrying someone else.

1262
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:31,411
How about you, Fifi?

1263
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,631
You identified a future
partner for life yet?

1264
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:39,179
- No need, really, the deed is done.

1265
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:43,099
I've been in love with
the same bloke for ages.

1266
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,312
- [Charlie] Have you, who's that?

1267
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:50,023
- You, Charlie.

1268
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,710
It's always been you.

1269
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:17,467
Since first we met, oh, so many years ago.

1270
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:20,929
I knew the first moment,

1271
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,474
across a crowded room, or lawn, in fact.

1272
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:31,971
Doesn't matter,

1273
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,182
(slow melancholy music)

1274
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:36,017
nothing either of us can do on this one,

1275
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,028
such is life.

1276
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:45,944
Friends isn't bad, you know?

1277
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:48,039
Friends is quite something.

1278
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:51,167
- Oh, Fi.

1279
01:17:55,797 --> 01:17:56,589
Fi.

1280
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,473
It's not all easy, is it?

1281
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:07,392
- No.

1282
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,397
Just forget this business, not to be.

1283
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,988
Matthew, darling, where's Gareth?

1284
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,231
- Torturing Americans.

1285
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,409
- How thoughtful of him.

1286
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,614
- Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?

1287
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,668
- Not personally, no.

1288
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,257
But I do know someone who could
get his fax number for you.

1289
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:41,666
Shall we dance?

1290
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:44,971
(upbeat jubilant music)

1291
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:58,902
(woman in black laughs)

1292
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,215
Well, any rings on fingers?

1293
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:32,383
- Oh, Gareth, you don't
know how lucky you are.

1294
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,303
Finding someone to marry
is a very tricky business.

1295
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:36,888
- It's hell out there.

1296
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,599
Matthew's trapped with an
evangelist from Minnesota.

1297
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:43,019
- Come down, sweet Jesus,
and cast out the devil!

1298
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,064
- My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,

1299
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:48,358
please charge your glasses.

1300
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:51,861
First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.

1301
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:54,405
(guests applaud)

1302
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:55,875
- Excellent, I love this girl.

1303
01:19:57,794 --> 01:19:59,535
- Thank you.

1304
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,246
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you

1305
01:20:01,256 --> 01:20:02,872
who've flown in from the States.

1306
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,259
I'm really touched.

1307
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,335
And as for the rest of you,

1308
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,295
I would have the fact that
lots of frightful Americans

1309
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,589
were flying in was a perfect
excuse for staying away,

1310
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,799
so I thank you too.

1311
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,353
(guests laugh)

1312
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,806
If my darling dad had been here today,

1313
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:22,183
he would have been speaking now.

1314
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,227
And I know what he would have said,

1315
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:25,395
great dress, babe,

1316
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,064
but why in the hell are you
marrying the stiff in the skirt?

1317
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:30,576
(guests laugh)

1318
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:35,999
And I would have given him the
same answer that I give you,

1319
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,950
because I love him.

1320
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,745
As John Lennon said, who
died the same year as my dad,

1321
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,455
“Love is the answer.

1322
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,050
"And you know that for sure."

1323
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:51,421
(guests applaud)

1324
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:55,648
Oh, oh, and one more thing,
someone told me here,

1325
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:58,511
confidentially, that if things
with Hamish didn't work out

1326
01:20:58,521 --> 01:20:59,345
that he would step in.

1327
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,931
And I just wanted to say thanks,
and I'll keep you posted.

1328
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:04,235
(all laugh)

1329
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:08,646
- Bravo!

1330
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:09,480
- [Best Man] And now, my lords,

1331
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,650
ladies and gentlemen, Sir Hamish Banks.

1332
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,371
(guests applaud)

1333
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,076
- Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years

1334
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,797
has gotten used to being
upstaged by a woman, isn't it?

1335
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,792
I didn't expect it to happen
to me on my wedding day.

1336
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,296
However, I must also
say that I'm quite happy

1337
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,130
(Gareth gasps)

1338
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,425
to be upstaged by this woman
for the rest of my life.

1339
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,093
Oh, clear, is that some
barracking at the back?

1340
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,272
Again, something we
politicians are used to.

1341
01:21:42,357 --> 01:21:43,931
- Shit, find a, find a doctor.

1342
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:44,807
- [Man] Right, okay.

1343
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,267
- First of all, I want to extend

1344
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,353
my compliments to the bridesmaids.

1345
01:21:48,363 --> 01:21:50,813
You did your duty superbly.

1346
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,483
And obviously, I intend
to use you every time

1347
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:54,817
I get married from now on.

1348
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,373
(guests laugh and applaud)

1349
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,699
(slow uneasy music)

1350
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:04,494
And also, I want to thank
all those wonderful ladies

1351
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,704
of the parish who did the
flowers in the church.

1352
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,582
The stern old building took on a look

1353
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,552
of flushing youth today.

1354
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,226
(guests laugh and applaud)

1355
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:24,180
The first time I laid eyes on her,

1356
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:28,069
I thought to myself, if by
any chance she's shortsighted

1357
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,948
I might just be happy
for the rest of my life.

1358
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,150
I thought I could see my
future for the first time.

1359
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:41,124
It was a joyful one for
years and years to come.

1360
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:45,628
(guests applaud)

1361
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:52,041
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

1362
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:55,420
♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪

1363
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:59,647
♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪

1364
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:03,479
♪ And so say all of us ♪

1365
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,483
(slow somber music)

1366
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:16,000
- Good morning, and a warm welcome

1367
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,419
to you all on this cold day.

1368
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:21,172
Our service will begin in a few minutes.

1369
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:25,399
But first we have asked Matthew,
Gareth's closest friend,

1370
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,146
to say a few words.

1371
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,492
- Gareth used to prefer
funerals to weddings.

1372
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:44,278
He said it was easier to get
enthusiastic about a ceremony

1373
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:47,448
one had an outside chance of
eventually being involved in.

1374
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,201
(guests chuckle)

1375
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:51,577
In order to prepare this speech,

1376
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,205
I rang people to get a general picture

1377
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:56,592
of how Gareth was regarded
by those who met him.

1378
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,295
Fat seems to have been a word

1379
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:02,848
people most connected with him.

1380
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,354
Terribly rude also rang a lot of bells.

1381
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:13,182
So very fat and very rude seems

1382
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,069
to have been the stranger's viewpoint.

1383
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:17,603
On the other hand,

1384
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:18,980
some of you have been
kind enough to ring me

1385
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,731
and let me know that you loved him,

1386
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,702
which I know he would have
been thrilled to hear.

1387
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,289
You remember his fabulous hospitality.

1388
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,917
His strange experimental cooking.

1389
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:35,538
The recipe for duck la
banana fortunately goes

1390
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:36,716
with him to his grave.

1391
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:43,472
Most of all, you tell me of
his enormous capacity for joy.

1392
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:48,811
And when joyful, when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness.

1393
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:55,568
But I hope joyful is how
you will remember him,

1394
01:25:58,029 --> 01:25:59,822
not stuck in a box in a church.

1395
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,276
Pick your favorite of his waistcoats

1396
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:06,537
and remember him that way.

1397
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:12,960
The most splendid, replete, big-hearted,

1398
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,841
weak-hearted, as it turned out,

1399
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:22,053
and jolly bugger most of us ever met.

1400
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:28,601
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.

1401
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,855
What I thought of him.

1402
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:39,612
Unfortunately, there I run out of words.

1403
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,442
Perhaps you will forgive me
if I turn from my own feelings

1404
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:50,915
to the words of another
splendid bugger, W.H. Auden.

1405
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,251
This is actually what I want to say,

1406
01:26:58,381 --> 01:27:00,498
stop all the clocks.

1407
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:01,676
Cut off the telephone.

1408
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:06,013
Prevent the dog from
barking with a juicy bone.

1409
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,310
Silence the pianos, and with muffled drum

1410
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:13,479
bring out the coffin.

1411
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,399
Let the mourners come.

1412
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:19,433
Let the airplanes circle,

1413
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:23,660
moaning overhead scribbling
on the sky the message,

1414
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:25,616
he is dead.

1415
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,705
Put great bows around the white
necks of the public doves.

1416
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:36,293
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.

1417
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:42,508
He was my north, my
south, my east and west.

1418
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:47,221
My working week and my Sunday rest.

1419
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:52,935
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song.

1420
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:58,232
I thought that love would last forever

1421
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:01,444
I was wrong.

1422
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:10,911
The stars are not wanted
now, put out every one.

1423
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,541
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun.

1424
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,088
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.

1425
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:26,343
For nothing now can ever come to any good.

1426
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,811
(slow somber music)

1427
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,533
- [Man] Bye, now.

1428
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,957
- It was good of you to come.

1429
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,168
Must have been the shortest
honeymoon in history.

1430
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:11,388
- No, it's fine, we'll
do it some other time.

1431
01:29:16,894 --> 01:29:19,136
You know, that thing
you said in the street?

1432
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,763
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.

1433
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:23,692
- No, I liked it, I liked you saying it.

1434
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:38,781
- Charlie, I'll take
Scarlett home, all right?

1435
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:41,168
- [Charlie] Yeah, darling Fi.

1436
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:51,512
- Walk, Charlie?

1437
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:55,015
- Yeah, yeah, that would be grand.

1438
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,094
- Never felt like that.

1439
01:30:00,104 --> 01:30:01,897
I mean, something vaguely similar

1440
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:04,441
for Jilly when I was young.

1441
01:30:05,693 --> 01:30:06,485
- Jilly?

1442
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:08,487
- Labrador.

1443
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,440
- Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

1444
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:16,026
For all these years we've
been single and proud of it

1445
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:17,945
and never noticed that two of us were,

1446
01:30:17,955 --> 01:30:21,240
for all intents and purposes,
married all this time.

1447
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,376
- Traitors in our midst.

1448
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:28,289
You know, in a way,

1449
01:30:28,299 --> 01:30:31,500
I think death is hardest
for the parents, don't you?

1450
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,137
I hope I die before my children.

1451
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:38,475
- Tom, there's one
thing I find really, uh,

1452
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:45,681
well, it's your total confidence
that you will get married.

1453
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,652
I mean, what if you never
find the right girl?

1454
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:51,103
- Sorry?

1455
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,073
- Surely, if that service shows anything

1456
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:57,902
it shows that there is such
a thing as a perfect match.

1457
01:30:57,912 --> 01:30:59,486
If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew

1458
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:03,042
then maybe we should just let it go.

1459
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,660
Some of us are not gonna get married.

1460
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,088
- Well, I don't know, Charlie.

1461
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:14,428
The truth is, unlike you, I
never expected the thunderbolt.

1462
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,880
I always just hoped
that I'd meet some nice,

1463
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,133
friendly girl, like the look of her.

1464
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:23,687
Hope the look of me didn't
make her physically sick.

1465
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:28,901
Then pop the question and
settle down and be happy.

1466
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:32,645
It worked for my parents.

1467
01:31:32,655 --> 01:31:34,897
Well, apart from the divorce and all that.

1468
01:31:34,907 --> 01:31:37,117
- I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.

1469
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,329
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1470
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:46,339
Maybe all this waiting
for one true love stuff

1471
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:47,211
gets you nowhere.

1472
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:53,175
(alarm clock rings)

1473
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,046
(alarm clock clicks)

1474
01:31:59,056 --> 01:32:02,768
(multiple alarm clocks ring)

1475
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:08,097
Ah, what the fuck is going on?

1476
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:10,651
(grunts) What?

1477
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:13,435
- I thought we'd better make

1478
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:16,563
absolutely sure we weren't late.

1479
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,816
Excellent wedding hairstyle by the way.

1480
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:22,361
(mid-tempo joyous music)

1481
01:32:22,371 --> 01:32:26,588
- Matthew, the best-looking
best man in the world.

1482
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:30,884
Listen, thank you for doing this today.

1483
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:32,047
- Of course.

1484
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:37,011
- I wish Gareth was here.

1485
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:39,763
- Bet he does too.

1486
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,426
I'm sorry I was so late.

1487
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:47,177
The others are just parking the car.

1488
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,471
I thought we'd all go with Tom.

1489
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,473
- Late, so late?

1490
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,475
- Yeah, it's 9:45.

1491
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:54,810
- 9:45?

1492
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,281
- Yep, 45 minutes till I do.

1493
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,951
- Bloody Tom, I told him
to set the alarm for 8:00!

1494
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,027
Fuck it!

1495
01:33:03,037 --> 01:33:03,829
Fuck!

1496
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,783
- [Matthew] Scarlett.

1497
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,118
- Oh, hi.

1498
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:11,952
- [Matthew] You ready?

1499
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:14,673
- Absolutely, give me 20 seconds.

1500
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:22,848
(car tires screech)

1501
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:25,382
- Time?

1502
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:26,300
- Honestly?

1503
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,593
- Yes, time?

1504
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:28,594
- It's about 10 to 9:00.

1505
01:33:28,604 --> 01:33:29,470
- Oh!

1506
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,774
(all laugh)

1507
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,614
Bastards.

1508
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:51,742
(all laugh)

1509
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:54,078
- [Woman] Jessica, stop
jumping up and down, please.

1510
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:54,912
(Jessica laughs)

1511
01:33:54,922 --> 01:33:58,499
Settle down, Tommy, you've got two arms.

1512
01:33:58,509 --> 01:34:01,095
- [Photographer] One, two, three, smile!

1513
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:03,347
Brilliant.

1514
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:06,048
- This is splendid stuff.

1515
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:09,301
- Yes, I think I might say a little word.

1516
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:12,471
Well, as many of you know,
I have been a close observer

1517
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:14,223
Charles' love life for many years now.

1518
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:17,226
But recently, I'd started to despair

1519
01:34:17,236 --> 01:34:19,228
and fear that really he
was married to us lot,

1520
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:21,688
apart from the fact that
we won't have his babies.

1521
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,315
- I don't know about that.

1522
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:25,109
- Fortunately, it's turned out splendidly.

1523
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:27,736
The girl in question is sadly crazy

1524
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,696
but perhaps that's why he loves her.

1525
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,906
So I'd like to propose a toast

1526
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:34,868
to my Charlie and his beautiful
girl on this tragic day.

1527
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:36,463
So be happy and don't forget us.

1528
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:38,705
- [Charles] Thank you.

1529
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,582
- To Charles and duck face.

1530
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,303
- [All] To Charles and duck face!

1531
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,008
- What do you think?

1532
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:50,968
- You look divine.

1533
01:34:50,978 --> 01:34:53,053
- It does work, doesn't it?

1534
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:53,856
Yes.

1535
01:34:56,984 --> 01:34:58,809
- Well, I'd like to thank
Fiona for those charming words

1536
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,978
words about my future wife.

1537
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:02,855
I'd like to take this
opportunity before the day starts

1538
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:05,357
to read a little message
from her to you all.

1539
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,192
- Oh, this is exciting.

1540
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,862
- She says, any of you
come near the house,

1541
01:35:09,872 --> 01:35:11,321
I'll set the dogs on you.

1542
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:12,114
I think that's rather--

1543
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:13,699
- That's a nice touch.

1544
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:16,702
(all laugh)

1545
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:18,922
- I'll set the dogs on you.

1546
01:35:20,257 --> 01:35:23,876
- [Matthew] John, hi, you made it, good.

1547
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:26,128
- Oh, yes, I hope me damn sister turns up.

1548
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,547
Not much of a wedding without a bride.

1549
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:30,007
Tom.

1550
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:30,841
Charlie.

1551
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:33,468
Bit of a poor show, you
not having a stag night.

1552
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,262
- Oh, we did, we did, we did, we did,

1553
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,597
we didn't think it was a very good idea

1554
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:39,183
in this day and age, uh, so.

1555
01:35:39,193 --> 01:35:39,985
- Really?

1556
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:42,154
Oh.

1557
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:00,871
(slow tranquil music)

1558
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:02,382
- Fi, you do look lovely today.

1559
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:06,428
- Yes, as you can see I've
abandoned my traditional black.

1560
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,087
- (chuckles) Yes, so you have.

1561
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,715
- From now on, I shall be
all the colors of the rainbow

1562
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:14,186
and fall in love with someone
who fancies me for a change.

1563
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,481
- Darling Fi.

1564
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:26,355
- Oh, look.

1565
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:27,564
- What?

1566
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:30,275
- Lipstick everywhere, that
won't do at all, will it?

1567
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:33,403
(church bells ring)

1568
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,206
- Hi, hi.

1569
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,100
- Good luck.

1570
01:36:59,231 --> 01:37:03,183
- [Scarlett] Hello, glad you could come.

1571
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:06,655
Groom's on the right, bride's on the left.

1572
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:10,983
- Groom right inside.

1573
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:12,035
- Oh, my God!

1574
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,001
I thought you'd gone back to Texas.

1575
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,461
- [Chester] Without you, never.

1576
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:27,634
- Good luck.

1577
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:34,891
- [Matthew] The bride or groom?

1578
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,644
Bride or groom?

1579
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,440
- It should be perfectly
obvious I'm neither.

1580
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:43,400
Great God!

1581
01:37:44,735 --> 01:37:46,310
- Bride or groom?

1582
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,185
- Bride.

1583
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:50,115
(slow organ music)

1584
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:00,542
- Yes, um, fine.

1585
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:06,246
You know, I've got a
feeling we've met before.

1586
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:10,334
We have, about 25 years ago.

1587
01:38:10,344 --> 01:38:12,669
I'm second cousin Harold's
daughter, Deirdre.

1588
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:13,962
You're Tom.

1589
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:17,591
- Good lord, so you're family.

1590
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:20,802
- Yes, only very distant.

1591
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,939
- Well, yes, of course.

1592
01:38:24,775 --> 01:38:28,101
You said you were bride?

1593
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:29,519
- Yes.

1594
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:30,781
- Well, well, do sit.

1595
01:38:31,907 --> 01:38:33,492
Do sit here, Deirdre.

1596
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:40,999
Golly, thunderbolt city.

1597
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:45,462
- [Bernard] Hello, Matthew.

1598
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:48,246
Hello, Charles.

1599
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:49,956
- Bernard, how are you?

1600
01:38:49,966 --> 01:38:51,583
- Exhausted, actually.

1601
01:38:51,593 --> 01:38:53,210
- [Lydia] That's funny, Charles.

1602
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,044
- Hello, Lyd.

1603
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,347
- Stick with me.

1604
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:01,468
- Hi.

1605
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:02,270
- Hi

1606
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,232
- You look lovely.

1607
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:09,101
But then as you know I did
like you dressed for weddings.

1608
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:09,976
And on time!

1609
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:11,780
- Yep, extraordinary thing, isn't it?

1610
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:14,189
How's Hamish?

1611
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:17,776
- Oh, he's fine, I believe.

1612
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,403
- You believe?

1613
01:39:19,413 --> 01:39:21,915
- Well, yes, he wasn't
the man for me after all.

1614
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,077
- You left him?

1615
01:39:27,087 --> 01:39:28,130
- We left each other.

1616
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:32,916
- When?

1617
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:35,585
- Oh, a few months now.

1618
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:39,381
March was hell, by April it was sordid.

1619
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:40,465
It's absolutely the last time

1620
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:42,259
I marry someone three times my age.

1621
01:39:42,269 --> 01:39:44,855
- [Matthew] Charlie,
Charles, time to travel.

1622
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:47,065
- Yeah, yeah.

1623
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:52,320
Coming, good, good.

1624
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:58,442
So why didn't you get in touch, then?

1625
01:39:58,452 --> 01:40:00,527
- I did think about it.

1626
01:40:00,537 --> 01:40:04,124
I wanted to, but, um, I was in a state.

1627
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:09,045
So anyway, I don't wanna keep you.

1628
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:13,206
And I'll see you afterwards.

1629
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,125
- Yeah, fine, excellent.

1630
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:15,927
Wait.

1631
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:23,393
I'll show you to your seat.

1632
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:27,981
Just showing her to her seat.

1633
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,445
- Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?

1634
01:40:43,455 --> 01:40:45,530
- It's been bad, yes.

1635
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,408
- It's been a disaster.

1636
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:53,173
- It has, as you say,
been very bad indeed.

1637
01:40:57,886 --> 01:40:59,387
God, it's lovely to see you.

1638
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:03,683
- Well, good luck.

1639
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:06,760
It's pretty easy.

1640
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:09,231
Just say I do whenever
anyone asks you a question.

1641
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:21,201
- Um, could you just
give me a sec, Matthew?

1642
01:41:22,494 --> 01:41:25,622
- Yes, of course, freshen up at will.

1643
01:41:44,683 --> 01:41:49,062
- Dear lord, forgive me
for what I'm about to say

1644
01:41:52,816 --> 01:41:55,777
in this magnificent place of worship.

1645
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:58,280
Bugger!

1646
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:01,449
Bugger!

1647
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:05,829
Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger!

1648
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,491
- Can I help at all?

1649
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:14,536
- Huh, no, thanks.

1650
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:19,509
Sorry, vocal exercises, big church.

1651
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:22,502
- Excellent, often do the same myself.

1652
01:42:22,512 --> 01:42:25,297
Not exactly the same vocab, obviously,

1653
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:26,506
rather more hallelujahs.

1654
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:27,757
(Charles chuckles)

1655
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:28,560
I'll leave you.

1656
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,940
(church bells ring)

1657
01:42:48,163 --> 01:42:48,987
- Bride's arriving.

1658
01:42:48,997 --> 01:42:50,363
- Oh, fabulous!

1659
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:51,875
We seem to have lost the groom.

1660
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:54,326
- Do you wanna see if you can stall her,

1661
01:42:54,336 --> 01:42:55,619
and I'll see if I can find him.

1662
01:42:55,629 --> 01:42:56,453
- Roger.

1663
01:42:56,463 --> 01:42:57,255
- Wilco.

1664
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:04,753
(knocking on door)

1665
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:05,587
Charles.

1666
01:43:05,597 --> 01:43:06,389
- [Charles] Hm?

1667
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,351
- It's good to see you.

1668
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,230
- Yeah, yeah.

1669
01:43:17,067 --> 01:43:20,445
Matt, what do we think about marriage?

1670
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,950
- (sighs) Gosh, well, I
think it's really good

1671
01:43:27,661 --> 01:43:29,788
if you love the person
with all your heart.

1672
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:32,332
- Well, exactly.

1673
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:34,417
Quite.

1674
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:41,549
All these weddings, all these years,

1675
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:45,595
all that blasted salmon and champagne.

1676
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:51,434
Here I am on my own wedding
day and I'm still thinking.

1677
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:55,230
- Well, can I ask about what?

1678
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:01,903
- No, no, I think best not.

1679
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:05,188
- I'm terribly sorry,
there's a bit of delay,

1680
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:06,356
there's just a slight
problem with the flowers.

1681
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,066
- Flowers, what?

1682
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:09,275
- Unfortunately, there seems to be

1683
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:10,819
a staggeringly high proportion

1684
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:12,404
of hay fever sufferers
in the congregation,

1685
01:44:12,414 --> 01:44:14,739
and they've been stuck right
next to the damn flowers.

1686
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,617
So we're just moving
them, the congregation.

1687
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:19,077
Don't want the damn vows to be obliterated

1688
01:44:19,087 --> 01:44:20,120
by the sound of sneezing.

1689
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:21,538
- Charles, would it be
out of place for me to say

1690
01:44:21,548 --> 01:44:23,091
that time is ticking by?

1691
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,867
- They should've started by now.

1692
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:51,985
- I think I've fooled them so far.

1693
01:44:51,995 --> 01:44:54,237
The great advantage of having
a reputation for being stupid,

1694
01:44:54,247 --> 01:44:55,832
people are less suspicious of you.

1695
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,845
(knocking on door)

1696
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:19,647
- Hello.

1697
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:23,183
- Here you are.

1698
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:24,360
Ready to face the enemy?

1699
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:27,822
- Are we?

1700
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:33,411
- Yes.

1701
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:36,915
Excellent.

1702
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:05,318
("Wedding March" by Felix Mendelssohn)

1703
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:34,097
- Not so tight, Dad!

1704
01:47:03,293 --> 01:47:06,452
- Dearly beloved we are
gathered together here

1705
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:10,415
in the sight of God and in
the face of this congregation

1706
01:47:10,425 --> 01:47:14,127
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony

1707
01:47:14,137 --> 01:47:17,547
which is an honorable
estate instituted of God

1708
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:19,924
in the time of man's innocence.

1709
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:22,176
Signifying unto us the mystical union

1710
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,856
that is betwixt Christ and His church

1711
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:29,142
and therefore is not by
any to be enterprised

1712
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:33,062
nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly

1713
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:37,289
but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly,

1714
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:39,704
and in the fear of God.

1715
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,781
Therefore, if any man
can show any just cause

1716
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:46,492
why they may not lawfully
be joined together

1717
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:51,090
let him speak now or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

1718
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:56,085
(knocking)

1719
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,723
I'm sorry, does someone
have something to say?

1720
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:10,058
Yes, what is it?

1721
01:48:10,068 --> 01:48:11,110
- One second.

1722
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:23,780
- What's going on, Charles?

1723
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:26,991
- [Henrietta] Charles, what?

1724
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:30,411
- He wants me to translate
what he's saying.

1725
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:31,547
- What is he saying?

1726
01:48:34,634 --> 01:48:36,803
- He says, I suspect the
groom is having doubts.

1727
01:48:38,638 --> 01:48:40,598
I suspect the groom would like to delay.

1728
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:46,437
I suspect the groom, I suspect the groom.

1729
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,285
- What's he saying?

1730
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:09,252
- He says he suspects the
groom loves someone else.

1731
01:49:11,713 --> 01:49:13,204
(guests chatter)

1732
01:49:13,214 --> 01:49:14,372
- And do you?

1733
01:49:14,382 --> 01:49:16,541
Do you love someone else?

1734
01:49:16,551 --> 01:49:17,552
Do you, Charles?

1735
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:30,513
- I do.

1736
01:49:30,523 --> 01:49:32,974
(Henrietta screams)

1737
01:49:32,984 --> 01:49:35,695
(guests chatter)

1738
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:41,743
- [Henrietta] Get out of my
way, get out of my way, oh!

1739
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:46,581
(thunder crackles)

1740
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:50,334
- Blimey.

1741
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:55,538
- At least it's one we won't forget.

1742
01:49:55,548 --> 01:49:57,665
I mean, a lot of weddings just blend

1743
01:49:57,675 --> 01:49:58,750
into each other, don't they?

1744
01:49:58,760 --> 01:49:59,584
- Oh, for God's sake.

1745
01:49:59,594 --> 01:50:02,378
- But this one will really
stick out in the memory.

1746
01:50:02,388 --> 01:50:05,506
- For not actually
including a wedding service.

1747
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:06,309
- Poor girl.

1748
01:50:07,226 --> 01:50:08,176
No, I mean it, poor girl!

1749
01:50:08,186 --> 01:50:09,010
I mean, she's not my
favorite person in the world,

1750
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,303
but I think that may have been

1751
01:50:10,313 --> 01:50:12,180
an unforgivable thing that you did today.

1752
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:14,484
- I can't bear to think about it.

1753
01:50:15,777 --> 01:50:17,477
Poor Hen.

1754
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:19,687
- Though, let's face facts.

1755
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:23,357
I mean, if you weren't sure
you wanted to marry her today

1756
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,579
of all days, i.e., your wedding day

1757
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:30,291
then it must be the right
decision, mustn't it?

1758
01:50:32,919 --> 01:50:33,743
- Quite right, Tom.

1759
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:35,119
- It was a lovely dress.

1760
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,298
I'm sure she'll find
it useful for parties.

1761
01:50:41,677 --> 01:50:43,753
- What did he say, Charles?

1762
01:50:43,763 --> 01:50:44,972
- Says he blames himself.

1763
01:50:45,932 --> 01:50:48,309
- [Matthew] Absolutely not,
no, you mustn't, David.

1764
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:51,969
(doorbell buzzes)

1765
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:52,804
Uh, no, it's okay--

1766
01:50:52,814 --> 01:50:55,556
- No, no, no, if there's
music to be faced,

1767
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:56,609
I should be facing it.

1768
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:07,453
- Hello.

1769
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:09,570
- Hi, you're soaking, come in--

1770
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,864
- No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1771
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:14,450
Comes a point you're so
wet, you can't get wetter.

1772
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,284
- Okay, I'll come out.

1773
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:16,087
- No, please don't.

1774
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:20,123
I just wanted to check you're okay.

1775
01:51:20,133 --> 01:51:23,469
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but,

1776
01:51:25,138 --> 01:51:26,629
but you're fine, so.

1777
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,382
(slow tender music)

1778
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:32,353
I shouldn't have come to the
church this morning, I'm sorry.

1779
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:34,856
- No, no!

1780
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:38,599
Wait, it was all my fault.

1781
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:40,862
I mean, I'm the bastard here.

1782
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:43,855
And it definitely sorted out one thing,

1783
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:46,691
which is marriage and
me we're very clearly

1784
01:51:46,701 --> 01:51:47,994
not meant for one another.

1785
01:51:49,412 --> 01:51:51,112
Sorted out another big thing as well.

1786
01:51:51,122 --> 01:51:52,947
There I was, standing there in the church

1787
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:55,950
and for the first time in
my whole life I realized

1788
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:59,839
I totally and utterly loved one person.

1789
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:04,167
And it wasn't the person
standing next to me in the veil,

1790
01:52:04,177 --> 01:52:09,015
it's the person standing
opposite me now in the rain.

1791
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:12,675
- Is it still raining?

1792
01:52:12,685 --> 01:52:14,385
I hadn't noticed.

1793
01:52:14,395 --> 01:52:16,888
- The truth of it is I've loved you

1794
01:52:16,898 --> 01:52:18,441
from the first second I met you.

1795
01:52:20,193 --> 01:52:22,351
You're not suddenly going
away again, are you?

1796
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:26,355
- No, I might drown, but otherwise, no.

1797
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:28,034
- Okay, okay, we'll go in.

1798
01:52:32,163 --> 01:52:34,832
But first, let me ask you one thing,

1799
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:40,745
do you think after we've dried off

1800
01:52:40,755 --> 01:52:43,539
after we've spent lots more time together

1801
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:48,471
you might agree not to marry me?

1802
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:53,856
And do you think not being
married to me might maybe

1803
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:57,803
be something you could consider doing

1804
01:52:57,813 --> 01:52:59,065
for the rest of your life?

1805
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:05,863
Do you?

1806
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:10,034
- I do.
