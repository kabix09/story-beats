00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,717
 "welling up for
 eternal life.

182
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,069
 "Let them bring me
 to your holy mountain

183
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,419
 "in the place
 where you dwell.

184
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,682
 "Across the desert
 and through the mountain

185
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,164
 "to the Canyon of
 the Crescent Moon,

186
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,733
 "to the temple
 where the cup that...

187
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,219
 "Where the cup that holds
 the blood of Jesus Christ
 resides forever."

188
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,397
 The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

189
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,966
 The chalice used by Christ
 during the Last Supper.

190
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,754
 The cup that
 caught His blood
 at the Crucifixion

191
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,799
 and was entrusted to
 Joseph of Arimathea.

192
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,368
 The Arthur legend.

193
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,675
 I've heard this
 bedtime story before.

194
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,112
 Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

195
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,593
 The gift of youth
 to whoever drinks
 from the Grail.

196
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,769
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

197
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,901
 An old man's dream.

198
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,165
 Every man's dream,
 including your father's,
 I believe.

199
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,997
 Grail lore is his hobby.

200
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,738
 He's a teacher of
 medieval literature.

201
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:35,957
 The one the students hope
 they don't get.

202
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,048
Walter, you're
neglecting your guests.

203
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,571
 DONOVAN: Be along
 in a moment, dear.

204
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,884
 Hard to resist,
 isn't it?

205
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,148
 The Holy Grail's
 final resting place
 described in detail.

206
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,498
 What good is it?

207
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,849
 This Grail tablet
 speaks of deserts
 and mountains and canyons.

208
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,547
 It's pretty vague.

209
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,636
 Where do you want
 to start looking?

210
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,638
 Maybe if the tablet
 were intact, you'd have
 something to go on,

211
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,988
 but the entire top
 portion is missing.

212
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:09,164
 Just the same, an attempt
 to recover the Grail is
 currently underway.

213
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,171
 Let me tell you
 another bedtime
 story, Dr. Jones.

214
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,392
After the Grail was
entrusted to Joseph
of Arimathea,

215
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,395
 it disappeared,
 and was lost for
 a thousand years

216
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,572
 before it was found again
 by three knights of
 the First Crusade.

217
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,095
 Three brothers,
 to be exact.

218
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,402
I've heard this one,
as well.

219
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,447
 Two of these brothers
 walked out of the desert

220
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,624
 150 years after
 having found the Grail

221
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,583
 and began the long journey
 back to France,

222
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,802
 but only one of them
 made it.

223
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:42,284
 And before dying
 of extreme old age,

224
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,982
 he supposedly imparted
 his tale to a...

225
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,463
 to a Franciscan friar,
 I think.

226
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,204
 Not "supposedly,"
 Dr. Jones.

227
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,338
 This is the manuscript

228
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:55,819
in which the friar
chronicled
the knight's story.

229
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:58,169
 It doesn't reveal
 the location of the Grail,
 I'm afraid,

230
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,823
 but the knight promised
 that two markers

231
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,782
 that had been
 left behind would.

232
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,220
 This tablet is one
 of those markers.

233
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,744
 It proves the knight's story
 is true.

234
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,443
 But as you pointed out,
 it's incomplete.

235
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,968
Now, the second marker
is entombed with the
knight's dead brother.

236
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,449
 Our project leader
 believes that tomb
 to be located

237
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,451
 within the city
 of Venice, Italy.

238
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,978
 As you can now see,
 Dr. Jones,

239
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,807
we're about to complete
a great quest

240
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,157
 that began almost
 2,000 years ago.

241
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,943
 We're only
 one step away.

242
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,858
 That's usually when
 the ground falls out
 from underneath your feet.

243
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,557
 You could be more
 right than you know.

244
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,602
 Yes?

245
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:40,864
 We've hit a snag.

246
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,086
 Our project leader
 has vanished,

247
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:47,828
 along with
 all his research.

248
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,613
 We received a cable
 from his colleague,
 Dr. Schneider,

249
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,574
 who has no idea
 of his whereabouts
 or what's become of him.

250
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:58,273
 I want you to
 pick up the trail
 where he left off.

251
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,275
 Find the man,
 and you will
 find the Grail.

252
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,584
 You've got the wrong Jones,
 Mr. Donovan.

253
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,805
 Why don't you
 try my father?

254
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,938
 We already have.

255
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,288
 Your father is the man
 who has disappeared.

256
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,955
 BRODY: Your father and I
 have been friends since
 time began.

257
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,217
 I've watched you
 grow up, Indy.

258
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,045
 I've watched
 the two of you
 grow apart.

259
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,655
I've never seen you
this concerned
about him before.

260
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,396
 Dad?

261
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,963
 He's an academic, a bookworm.
 He's not a field man.

262
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,964
 Dad?

263
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:38,618
 Dad?

264
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,359
 Dear God.

265
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,452
 BRODY:
 What has the old fool
 got himself into now?

266
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,543
 I don't know,
 but whatever it is,
 he's in over his head.

267
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,546
 Dad?

268
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,635
 It's today's mail,
 and it's been opened.

269
00:22:58,464 --> 00:22:59,334
 Mail.

270
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,641
 That's it, Marcus.

271
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,558
 Venice, Italy.

272
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,301
 BRODY: What is it?

273
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,437
 It's Dad's
 Grail diary.

274
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:21,530
 Every clue he followed.
 Every discovery he made.

275
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,053
 A complete record
 of his search for
 the Holy Grail.

276
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,884
This is his whole life.

277
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,104
 Why would he have
 sent this to me?

278
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,975
 I don't know,

279
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,021
 but someone must
 want it pretty badly.

280
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,076
 Do you believe, Marcus?

281
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,961
 Do you believe the Grail
 actually exists?

282
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:08,011
 The search for the
 Cup of Christ is the search
 for the divine in all of us.

283
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,839
 But if you want facts, Indy,
 I've none to give you.

284
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,583
 At my age,
 I'm prepared to take
 a few things on faith.

285
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,461
 Call Donovan, Marcus.

286
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,724
 Tell him I'll take that
 ticket to Venice now.

287
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,423
I'll tell him
we'll take two.

288
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,084
 All right, tell me
 what's going to happen
 when we get to Venice.

289
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:39,042
 Don't worry,
 Dr. Schneider will
 be there to meet you.

290
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,043
 Schneider? I maintain an apartment
 in Venice.

291
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,436
It's at your disposal.

292
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,785
 Oh, well, that's good.
 Thank you.

293
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,878
 Dr. Jones, good luck.

294
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:51,054
 Now be very careful.
 Don't trust anybody.

295
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,177
  Signora? Signorina?

296
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:39,146
 Ah, Venice...Yes.

297
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:43,063
 How will we recognize
 this Dr. Schneider
 when we see him?

298
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,282
 I don't know.
 Maybe he'll know us.

299
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,327
 WOMAN: Dr. Jones?

300
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,156
INDY: Yes?

301
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,462
 I knew it was you.

302
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,291
 You have your
 father's eyes.

303
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:01,037
 And my mother's ears,
 but the rest belongs
 to you.

304
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,822
Looks like the best
parts have already
been spoken for.

305
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,085
 Marcus Brody?

306
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:05,912
 That's right.

307
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,001
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

308
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:08,915
 How do you do?

309
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,746
ELSA: The last time
I saw your father,
we were in the library.

310
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,313
 He was very close
 to tracking down
 the knight's tomb.

311
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,141
 [LAUGHS] I've never
 seen him so excited.

312
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,491
 He was as giddy
 as a schoolboy.

313
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,624
 INDY: Who?
 Attila the Professor?

314
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:25,105
He was never giddy,
even when he was
a schoolboy.

315
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,848
 Fraulein,
will you permit me?

316
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,458
 I usually don't. I usually don't, either.

317
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,981
In that case,
I permit you.

318
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,374
 It would make me
 very happy.

319
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:35,376
 But I'm already sad.
 By tomorrow,
 it will have faded.

320
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,769
Tomorrow
I'll steal you another.

321
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,945
 I hate to interrupt you,
 but the reason we're here...

322
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,077
 Yes. I have something
 to show you.

323
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,384
 I left your father
 working in the library.

324
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:46,648
 He sent me
 to the map section to fetch
 an ancient plan of the city.

325
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:49,433
 When I got back to
 his table, he'd gone,
 with all his papers,

326
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,218
 except for that scrap,
 which I found
 near his chair.

327
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,176
Roman numerals.

328
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,439
 ELSA:
 Here is the library.

329
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,138
 INDY: That doesn't look
 much like a library.

330
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,270
BRODY: Looks like
a converted church.

331
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,229
 In this case,
 it's the literal truth.

332
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,579
 We are on holy ground.

333
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,235
 These columns over here
 were brought back
 as spoils of war

334
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,716
 after the sacking
 of Byzantium
 during the Crusades.

335
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,371
 Now, please excuse me.

336
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,243
 The library's closing
 in a few moments.

337
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,506
 I'll arrange for us
 to stay a little longer.

338
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,947
Marcus, I've seen
this window before.

339
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,427
 Where?

340
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:28,037
 Right here,
 in Dad's diary.

341
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,395
 INDY: You see?

342
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,659
Look, Indy.
The Roman numerals.

343
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:44,401
 Dad was onto
 something here.

344
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,055
 Well, now we know
 the source of the numbers,

345
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:48,057
 but we still don't know
 what they mean.

346
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,016
 Dad sent me this diary
 for a reason.

347
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,148
 Until we find out why,
 I suggest we keep it
 to ourselves.

348
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,802
