1
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,820
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,690
America has made my fortune

3
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,793
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:04,228
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,833
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:10,934
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,375
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:16,470
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:21,080
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,683
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,648
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:29,953
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:33,361
She resisted.

14
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,862
She kept her honor.

15
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,625
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:45,268
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,710
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,211
held together by wire.

19
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,809
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:02,146
But I wept.
Why did I weep?

21
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:07,327
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:11,698
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,170
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,813
Sorry.

25
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:37,457
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:41,027
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,095
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,701
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:51,004
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,573
They went free that very day.

31
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:58,245
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,380
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,389
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,990
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:18,196
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,202
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:24,297
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:28,008
What is that?

39
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,401
That I cannot do.

40
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:57,404
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,573
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:06,011
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:09,050
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,651
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:16,385
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,760
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,261
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:25,393
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,001
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,605
I understand.

51
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,507
You found paradise in America.

52
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:39,314
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:42,011
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,618
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:50,016
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,626
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:57,230
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,893
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:02,502
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,440
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,442
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,943
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,340
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,179
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,853
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,425
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,475
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:47,380
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:51,745
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,855
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,356
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,593
And if, by chance,

73
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,662
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,163
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,767
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,341
Be my friend?

77
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,280
Godfather.

78
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:26,353
Good.

79
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,390
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,891
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,196
But until that day...

82
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,458
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,437
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,980
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,919
I want reliable people,

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,121
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,656
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:04,217
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,219
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,987
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:34,222
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:36,723
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,224
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,598
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,117
Don Barzini.

96
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,618
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:56,964
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,632
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,009
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,844
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,345
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,848
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,393
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,354
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,820
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:48,321
In small bills, cash.

107
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:51,157
In that little silk purse.

108
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:54,093
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:57,561
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,534
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,035
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,745
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,727
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,062
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:30,964
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,340
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:41,841
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,715
Get outta here.

119
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:50,216
This is a private party.
Go on.

120
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,653
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,229
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:09,200
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:13,072
There.

124
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,087
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,716
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,324
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,095
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,596
Now that the war is over...

129
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:39,725
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:43,396
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:46,005
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,010
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,511
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,081
You understand everything.

135
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,284
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:02,857
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:04,292
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,853
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:16,195
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,500
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:24,143
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,486
Hey, Michael.
How are you?

143
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:34,987
Hello.

144
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,403
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,184
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,119
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,188
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:08,889
All right.

149
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,121
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,727
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,330
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,233
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,860
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,538
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,039
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,443
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,280
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,615
Who is he?
What's his name?

159
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,210
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,819
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,118
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,119
Mike!

163
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,620
Ho! Tom.

164
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,121
Heyyy!

165
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:50,197
You look terrific!

166
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,400
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,926
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,405
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:59,140
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:01,641
I'll be there.

171
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,706
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,815
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,316
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,719
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,789
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,992
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,797
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:25,132
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,633
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:29,904
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:32,405
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,474
You like your lasagna?

183
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:44,385
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,717
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,828
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,598
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:02,201
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:08,066
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,946
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,939
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,508
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,688
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:23,189
Thank you.

194
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,679
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:32,284
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,121
Also some of the judges.

197
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:38,124
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,461
What is that outside?

199
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,100
Johnny!

200
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,544
I love you.

201
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,247
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,085
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:12,293
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:14,794
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,534
Sing a song.

206
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:38,584
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:42,646
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,825
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,920
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,797
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,732
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,367
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:57,065
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:03,007
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,611
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:12,349
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:16,049
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:22,224
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,595
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,736
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,400
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,508
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,376
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,979
with a big bandleader.

225
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,483
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:44,984
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,383
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,990
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,426
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:58,397
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,860
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,470
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:09,201
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,974
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,850
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:19,376
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,322
What was that?

238
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,154
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,529
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,030
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,104
That's a true story.

242
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,984
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,333
Beautiful!

244
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,644
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:20,145
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,367
I'll take care of it.

247
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,838
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,382
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:59,518
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:03,122
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:08,090
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,696
Yeah.
This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:16,097
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,539
It's weak.

255
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,168
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:23,904
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,513
But this, uh...

258
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:29,783
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,852
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:34,447
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:38,117
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,630
Sonny?

263
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,331
Sonny?

264
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,873
Sonny?

265
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,602
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,344
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:03,315
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:20,057
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,002
A best-seller.

270
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:24,304
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:26,805
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,308
Just be myself.

273
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,177
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:36,517
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,353
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,982
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,993
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,561
What is that nonsense?

279
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:50,062
Ridiculous!

280
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,334
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,006
Good.

282
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:01,108
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,443
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,944
Come here.

285
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,917
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:15,155
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:18,284
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:20,893
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:24,163
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,670
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:32,265
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:36,369
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:39,812
All right.

294
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,801
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,407
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:11,606
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:14,081
Never.
Give him a living...

298
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:17,108
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,618
What else?

300
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,220
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,622
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,123
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,494
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:29,596
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,395
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,000
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,938
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,810
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,281
Wait a minute.

310
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,782
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,022
Just a little closer.

312
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:57,523
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:44,863
Isn't that nice?

314
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,571
All right, start talking.

315
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:54,072
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,538
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:27:57,645 --> 00:28:01,376
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,982
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:07,079
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,753
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,765
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,667
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:22,502
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:24,638
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,640
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,642
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:31,044
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,707
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:35,448
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,949
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:40,320
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,588
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,183
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:47,193
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:49,296
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:52,198
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,531
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:58,136
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,040
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,481
Check him out.

341
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:33,805
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,109
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,411
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:41,040
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,416
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,485
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,986
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,589
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,320
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,926
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,991
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,435
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,771
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:07,272
Khartoum.

355
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:14,103
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:15,782
Beautiful.

357
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,450
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,951
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,922
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,260
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,262
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:30,397
I respect that.

363
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:32,898
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:38,303
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:41,364
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,975
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:49,076
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,184
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,685
And let me tell you why.

371
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:58,051
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,160
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:02,495
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:05,556
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,068
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,370
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:13,101
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,608
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,134
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,045
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,275
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,284
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:26,785
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,656
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,558
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:36,361
And she runs off.

387
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,723
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:43,370
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:46,135
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,641
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,777
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,278
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:57,176
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,785
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,817
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,725
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:05,372
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,979
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:11,116
Now...

400
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,419
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,457
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,259
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,760
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,090
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,532
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:31,537
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:36,207
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,411
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,413
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,212
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,485
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,619
Santino Corleone.

413
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,488
What about his prison record?

414
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,989
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,059
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:56,561
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,165
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,802
Tom?

419
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,303
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,373
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,809
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,945
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,146
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:16,480
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:18,785
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,550
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:23,957
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,458
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,293
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,795
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,296
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,929
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,180
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,780
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,988
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,652
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,362
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,297
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:07,096
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:10,902
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,005
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:19,511
My compliments.

443
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:24,944
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,649
So, I receive 30%
for finance...

445
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,258
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,759
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:40,566
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:43,603
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,904
just "finance"...

450
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,905
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,687
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,990
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,491
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:14,328
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:17,970
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,769
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,444
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:26,813
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:30,011
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:32,745
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,854
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:37,619
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,225
but your business is...

464
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,029
a little dangerous.

465
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,530
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,233
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,964
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,570
Wait a minute.

469
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,646
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,982
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,684
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,819
But anyway...

473
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,320
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:12,187
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,557
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:18,631
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,567
Thank you.

478
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:45,523
Come here.

479
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:49,128
What's the matter with you?

480
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:50,930
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:53,798
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:57,302
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:01,973
Go on.

484
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:07,441
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:10,048
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,587
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:17,088
Take it over there.

488
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,826
And...

489
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,327
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:31,331
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:34,805
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:37,710
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,046
and make them think...

494
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,744
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:47,352
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:08,130
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,309
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,006
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:15,214
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,715
Oh, just you.

501
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,051
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,486
Okay, Pa.

503
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:56,388
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:01,893
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:54,402
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,982
I know.

507
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:58,483
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,158
You know who I am?

509
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,293
Oh. Tom Hagen.

510
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,095
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

511
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:52,031
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

512
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,033
I haven't got time.

513
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,798
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

514
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,506
What are you worried about?

515
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:03,007
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

516
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,310
Get in.

517
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:18,291
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

518
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,992
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

519
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,033
Hi. Merry Christmas.

520
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,534
I want some fruit over there.

521
00:44:33,273 --> 00:44:35,773
Gimme three of them.

522
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:39,377
No, that one.

523
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:59,997
Fredo!

524
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:49,146
Papa.

525
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:51,682
Papa!

526
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,287
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

527
00:45:59,392 --> 00:46:01,892
like in the story, you know?

528
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,131
No.

529
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:08,133
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

530
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:10,735
Now that's a thought.

531
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:13,106
Michael.

532
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:17,038
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

533
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:19,643
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

534
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:37,928
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

535
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,048
Sonny, Michael.

536
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,449
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

537
00:47:03,556 --> 00:47:05,224
Is he all right?

538
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:07,955
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

539
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,996
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

540
00:47:12,432 --> 00:47:15,560
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

541
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,103
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

542
00:47:18,104 --> 00:47:20,272
Didn't Tom tell you?
I called.

543
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:24,004
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

544
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,610
All right.

545
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,819
Oh, my God.

546
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,302
Who is it?

547
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:53,904
Open up. It's Clemenza.

548
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:55,974
What?

549
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:58,475
There's more news about your old man.

550
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:01,013
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

551
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:03,015
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

552
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,516
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

553
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,753
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

554
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,274
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

555
00:48:10,323 --> 00:48:11,890
Only maybe three, four times.

556
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,959
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

557
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,694
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

558
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:17,529
I don't care how sick he is.

559
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,192
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him to
my father's house now. You understand? Now

560
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,098
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

561
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:25,703
All right.

562
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:35,913
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

563
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,787
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

564
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:44,288
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

565
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:48,394
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

566
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:51,862
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

567
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,599
<i>What's done is done.</i>

568
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,569
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

569
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,169
No, I'll wait.

570
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:15,185
Your boss is dead.

571
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,992
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

572
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:22,493
so I don't want you to be scared.

573
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,587
I want you
to help the Corleones...

574
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:28,198
and I want you to help me.

575
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,604
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

576
00:49:32,605 --> 00:49:35,105
just about an hour after we picked you up.

577
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:39,443
Drink it.

578
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:46,018
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

579
00:49:50,557 --> 00:49:53,057
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

580
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,961
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

581
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,298
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

582
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:04,568
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

583
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,739
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

584
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,971
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

585
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:14,112
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

586
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:16,613
that will prevent a full-scale war.

587
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:19,551
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

588
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:22,112
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

589
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:27,524
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

590
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:33,565
Well, now he's dead.

591
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:36,066
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

592
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,838
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

593
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,773
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

594
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:44,274
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

595
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:51,181
It's good business, Tom.

596
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:54,419
I'll try.

597
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,082
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

598
00:51:00,093 --> 00:51:02,593
Yeah. Well...

599
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:05,896
Let me worry about Luca.

600
00:51:11,304 --> 00:51:13,205
You just talk to Sonny.

601
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,706
And the other two kids.

602
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,445
I'll do my best.

603
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,946
Good.

604
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,250
Now, you can go.

605
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:36,459
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

606
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:40,497
Blood is a big expense.

607
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:03,488
He's still alive.

608
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,989
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

609
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:09,494
Well, that's bad luck for me...

610
00:52:09,495 --> 00:52:11,995
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

611
00:52:56,976 --> 00:52:59,044
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

612
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,545
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

613
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:05,884
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

614
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:08,752
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

615
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:11,517
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

616
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:14,124
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

617
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:16,428
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

618
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:19,023
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

619
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,499
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

620
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:26,672
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

621
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:28,774
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

622
00:53:28,775 --> 00:53:29,841
Hey, Mick, try him again.

623
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,510
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

624
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:34,011
He always goes home
when he's through.

625
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:37,516
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

626
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:40,745
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

627
00:53:40,853 --> 00:53:43,353
If we lose the old man...

628
00:53:44,123 --> 00:53:47,058
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

629
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,061
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

630
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:52,531
just to avoid a long destructive war.

631
00:53:52,532 --> 00:53:56,263
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

632
00:53:57,503 --> 00:54:00,003
If your father dies...

633
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,108
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

634
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:05,669
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

635
00:54:05,778 --> 00:54:08,278
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

636
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,219
What is it?

637
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:17,689
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

638
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,318
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

639
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:22,926
Yeah?
Tessio, go see what it is.

640
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:28,300
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

641
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:29,801
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

642
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:32,498
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

643
00:54:32,605 --> 00:54:34,673
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

644
00:54:34,674 --> 00:54:36,441
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

645
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:38,942
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

646
00:54:40,646 --> 00:54:43,146
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

647
00:54:43,182 --> 00:54:45,707
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

648
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:48,912
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

649
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,355
Understood.

650
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:52,691
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

651
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,893
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

652
00:54:54,894 --> 00:54:58,955
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

653
00:54:59,065 --> 00:55:01,333
Yeah.

654
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:04,861
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

655
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,472
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

656
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:19,649
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

657
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:22,252
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

658
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:38,535
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

659
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:41,071
I don't know. Probably late.

660
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:45,868
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:52,381
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

662
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:56,121
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

663
00:55:56,122 --> 00:55:58,190
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

664
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:00,751
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

665
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,954
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

666
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:06,431
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

667
00:56:06,432 --> 00:56:08,932
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

668
00:56:08,968 --> 00:56:11,303
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

669
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:13,804
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

670
00:56:24,183 --> 00:56:26,618
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

671
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:29,679
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

672
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:32,690
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

673
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:35,989
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time, you know?

674
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,296
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

675
00:56:38,297 --> 00:56:40,398
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

676
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:43,368
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

677
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:45,969
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

678
00:56:47,173 --> 00:56:49,673
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

679
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:51,810
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

680
00:56:51,811 --> 00:56:54,311
I gotta take a leak.

681
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:37,322
Leave the gun.

682
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:39,823
Take the cannoli.

683
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:58,112
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

684
00:57:58,613 --> 00:58:00,113
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

685
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:02,614
Yeah?

686
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,114
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

687
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:12,322
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

688
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:17,595
Hello, Kay?

689
00:58:17,596 --> 00:58:18,964
<i>How's your father?</i>

690
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:20,765
He's good.
He's gonna make it.

691
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:23,266
<i>I love you.</i>

692
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:24,267
Huh?

693
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,570
<i>I love you!</i>

694
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,307
<i>Michael?</i>

695
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,708
Yeah, I know.

696
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:31,509
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

697
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,210
Yeah, I can't talk.

698
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:35,011
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

699
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:38,315
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

700
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:41,509
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

701
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,688
I love you
with all o' my heart!

702
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:46,214
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

703
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,461
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

704
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,962
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

705
00:58:52,465 --> 00:58:54,799
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

706
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,368
Then you fry some garlic.

707
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:58,997
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

708
00:58:59,105 --> 00:59:01,767
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

709
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:05,037
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

710
00:59:07,913 --> 00:59:10,413
Add a little bit of wine.

711
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:16,153
And a little bit of sugar.

712
00:59:16,922 --> 00:59:18,923
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

713
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:21,092
I got more important things
for you to do.

714
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:23,687
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

715
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:28,265
- Where you going?
- To the city.

716
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:29,934
Send some bodyguards with him.

717
00:59:29,935 --> 00:59:31,936
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

718
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:34,838
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

719
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,440
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

720
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:42,946
Send somebody with him anyway.

721
01:00:11,143 --> 01:00:12,977
I have to go.

722
01:00:12,978 --> 01:00:15,478
Can I go with you?

723
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:18,375
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

724
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,485
People from the press.

725
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,986
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

726
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,490
I don't want you to get involved.

727
01:00:30,162 --> 01:00:32,662
When will I see you again?

728
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:40,839
Go back to New Hampshire...

729
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,340
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

730
01:00:44,677 --> 01:00:47,177
When will I see you again,
Michael?

731
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,181
I don't know.

732
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,348
What are you doing here?

733
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:05,450
You're not supposed
to be here now.

734
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:09,012
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

735
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:11,681
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

736
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,125
Your father just had
too many visitors.

737
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:17,027
They interfered
with hospital service.

738
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:20,030
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

739
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,872
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

740
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,977
Nurse, wait a minute.
Stay here.

741
01:03:37,816 --> 01:03:40,151
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

742
01:03:40,152 --> 01:03:42,712
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

743
01:03:42,821 --> 01:03:45,813
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

744
01:03:45,924 --> 01:03:48,722
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

745
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:51,162
I won't panic.

746
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:53,723
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

747
01:03:56,669 --> 01:03:59,399
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

748
01:03:59,505 --> 01:04:02,565
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

749
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:06,167
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

750
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:08,479
Men are coming here to kill him.

751
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,615
You understand?

752
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:13,116
Now, help me, please.

753
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:34,194
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

754
01:05:34,299 --> 01:05:35,800
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

755
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:37,635
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

756
01:05:37,636 --> 01:05:39,637
There's gonna be trouble.

757
01:05:39,638 --> 01:05:42,138
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

758
01:05:42,141 --> 01:05:44,641
For your father. For your father.

759
01:05:45,644 --> 01:05:47,478
All right, listen.

760
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:49,647
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

761
01:05:49,648 --> 01:05:52,674
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

762
01:05:52,675 --> 01:05:54,075
Okay, okay.

763
01:06:06,598 --> 01:06:10,898
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

764
01:06:12,104 --> 01:06:14,604
I'm with you now.

765
01:06:15,774 --> 01:06:18,274
I'm with you.

766
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:55,311
Get rid of these.
Come here.

767
01:06:55,647 --> 01:06:58,147
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

768
01:06:58,817 --> 01:07:01,317
You'll be all right.

769
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:08,091
You'll be okay.

770
01:07:51,803 --> 01:07:54,303
You did good.

771
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,607
Here he is.

772
01:08:29,608 --> 01:08:32,108
All right, hold still.

773
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,988
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

774
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:45,456
What the hell are you doing here?

775
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:47,957
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

776
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:49,961
Why, you little punk.

777
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,963
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

778
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,864
I pulled them guys off of here.

779
01:08:53,865 --> 01:08:56,857
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

780
01:08:56,969 --> 01:08:59,938
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

781
01:09:00,639 --> 01:09:02,640
Phil, take him in.

782
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:05,076
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

783
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:07,978
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

784
01:09:10,082 --> 01:09:12,607
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

785
01:09:13,919 --> 01:09:16,053
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

786
01:09:16,054 --> 01:09:18,554
Stand him up straight.

787
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:42,513
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

788
01:09:42,514 --> 01:09:45,244
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

789
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:47,885
They're licensed to carry firearms.

790
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:50,386
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

791
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:53,015
in the morning and show cause.

792
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,625
All right, let him go.

793
01:09:55,694 --> 01:09:58,194
Come on.

794
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:29,660
What's with all the new faces?

795
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:31,495
Gonna need 'em now.

796
01:10:31,496 --> 01:10:34,124
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

797
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:37,360
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

798
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,170
Jesus Christ.

799
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:50,012
Looks like a fortress around here.

800
01:10:54,519 --> 01:10:57,420
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

801
01:10:57,522 --> 01:11:00,753
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

802
01:11:03,361 --> 01:11:05,861
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

803
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:11,001
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

804
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:12,503
You're gorgeous.

805
01:11:12,504 --> 01:11:15,200
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

806
01:11:15,307 --> 01:11:18,037
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

807
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:20,478
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

808
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:22,979
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

809
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:25,816
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

810
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:28,877
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

811
01:11:29,488 --> 01:11:31,155
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

812
01:11:31,156 --> 01:11:32,823
That's part of the deal.

813
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:34,825
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

814
01:11:34,826 --> 01:11:37,326
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

815
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:40,164
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

816
01:11:40,165 --> 01:11:43,726
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

817
01:11:43,835 --> 01:11:45,669
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

818
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,338
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

819
01:11:47,339 --> 01:11:49,006
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

820
01:11:49,007 --> 01:11:51,175
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

821
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:54,236
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

822
01:11:54,346 --> 01:11:57,747
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

823
01:11:57,849 --> 01:11:59,683
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

824
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:01,519
And do me a favor, Tom...

825
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,521
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

826
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:06,022
Just help me win, please.
All right?

827
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:14,523
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

828
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:16,133
What about him?

829
01:12:16,134 --> 01:12:19,194
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

830
01:12:19,304 --> 01:12:22,205
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

831
01:12:22,307 --> 01:12:24,308
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

832
01:12:24,309 --> 01:12:26,477
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

833
01:12:26,478 --> 01:12:28,312
he is invulnerable.

834
01:12:28,313 --> 01:12:31,874
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

835
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:35,043
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

836
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:37,883
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

837
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,686
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

838
01:12:43,161 --> 01:12:45,329
So do me a favor.

839
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,958
Take this into consideration.

840
01:12:50,769 --> 01:12:53,269
All right, we'll wait.

841
01:12:58,009 --> 01:13:00,509
We can't wait.

842
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:02,513
Can't wait.

843
01:13:02,514 --> 01:13:04,281
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

844
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:06,450
He's gonna kill Pop.
That's it.

845
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,285
That's the key for him.

846
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:10,287
Got to get Sollozzo.

847
01:13:10,288 --> 01:13:12,456
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

848
01:13:12,457 --> 01:13:14,458
Let me ask you something first.

849
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:17,519
What about this McCluskey?

850
01:13:17,629 --> 01:13:20,129
What do we do with this cop here?

851
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:26,969
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

852
01:13:28,473 --> 01:13:31,033
It will be me...

853
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:33,642
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

854
01:13:34,646 --> 01:13:37,146
Let's set the meeting.

855
01:13:38,817 --> 01:13:42,218
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

856
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:48,053
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

857
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,890
Someplace where there's people,
so I feel safe.

858
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,734
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

859
01:13:57,836 --> 01:14:00,336
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

860
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:06,008
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

861
01:14:06,111 --> 01:14:08,611
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

862
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:15,951
then I'll kill them both.

863
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:30,357
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

864
01:14:30,468 --> 01:14:32,469
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

865
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,471
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

866
01:14:34,472 --> 01:14:36,473
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

867
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:38,809
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

868
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,477
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

869
01:14:40,478 --> 01:14:43,879
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

870
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:46,317
You're taking this very personal.

871
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:49,549
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

872
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:51,689
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

873
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,215
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

874
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:57,056
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

875
01:14:57,162 --> 01:15:01,292
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

876
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:04,266
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

877
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:06,437
That's a terrific story.

878
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:09,168
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

879
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:12,943
They might like a story like that.

880
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:15,444
They might.
They just might.

881
01:15:18,283 --> 01:15:20,451
It's not personal, Sonny.

882
01:15:20,452 --> 01:15:22,952
It's strictly business.

883
01:15:24,956 --> 01:15:26,623
It's as cold as they come.

884
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:30,185
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

885
01:15:30,295 --> 01:15:33,196
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

886
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:35,798
Here. Try it.

887
01:15:46,478 --> 01:15:48,978
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

888
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,318
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

889
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,052
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

890
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:01,657
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

891
01:16:04,262 --> 01:16:06,430
Sit down, finish my dinner.

892
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:08,098
Come on, kid.
Don't fool around.

893
01:16:08,099 --> 01:16:11,660
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

894
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,937
Everybody will still think
you got it.

895
01:16:13,938 --> 01:16:16,106
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

896
01:16:16,107 --> 01:16:19,167
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

897
01:16:19,277 --> 01:16:22,678
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

898
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:24,782
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

899
01:16:24,783 --> 01:16:27,283
so don't worry about nothing.

900
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:30,287
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

901
01:16:30,288 --> 01:16:32,623
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

902
01:16:32,624 --> 01:16:35,124
and we're gonna catch the hell.

903
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:37,294
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

904
01:16:37,295 --> 01:16:39,296
Pretty goddamn bad.

905
01:16:39,297 --> 01:16:42,357
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

906
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:45,368
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

907
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,030
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

908
01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:50,699
Been ten years since
the last one.

909
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:52,810
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

910
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:54,978
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

911
01:16:54,979 --> 01:16:56,980
They should have never let him
get away with that.

912
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:59,481
They was just asking
for big trouble.

913
01:16:59,818 --> 01:17:02,378
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

914
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:04,254
being a hero and all.

915
01:17:04,255 --> 01:17:06,755
Your father too.

916
01:17:44,129 --> 01:17:45,963
Nothing.
Not a hint.

917
01:17:45,964 --> 01:17:48,464
Absolutely nothing.

918
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:51,534
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

919
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:55,304
How much time do we have?

920
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:57,975
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

921
01:17:57,976 --> 01:18:00,476
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

922
01:18:02,147 --> 01:18:04,647
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

923
01:18:04,749 --> 01:18:07,980
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

924
01:18:08,086 --> 01:18:09,620
What about the negotiator?

925
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:12,317
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

926
01:18:12,423 --> 01:18:14,224
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

927
01:18:14,225 --> 01:18:17,854
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

928
01:18:17,962 --> 01:18:21,523
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

929
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:23,934
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

930
01:18:23,935 --> 01:18:25,936
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

931
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:28,437
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

932
01:18:29,107 --> 01:18:31,607
I get it.

933
01:18:40,952 --> 01:18:43,452
Yeah.

934
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,201
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

935
01:18:59,304 --> 01:19:01,138
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

936
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:03,972
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

937
01:19:04,075 --> 01:19:06,976
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

938
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:08,645
Anybody know this joint?

939
01:19:08,646 --> 01:19:12,047
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

940
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,418
A small family place, good food.

941
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:17,252
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

942
01:19:17,355 --> 01:19:20,153
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

943
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:23,489
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

944
01:19:25,096 --> 01:19:27,656
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

945
01:19:27,765 --> 01:19:29,266
All right.

946
01:19:29,267 --> 01:19:32,430
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

947
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:34,938
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

948
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:36,640
You make them relax.

949
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:39,009
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

950
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,672
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

951
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:43,647
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

952
01:19:43,648 --> 01:19:46,583
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

953
01:19:46,684 --> 01:19:48,785
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

954
01:19:48,786 --> 01:19:50,787
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

955
01:19:50,788 --> 01:19:53,780
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

956
01:19:53,891 --> 01:19:55,626
The gun will be there.

957
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:59,859
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

958
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:02,464
Come on. Let's move.

959
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:05,033
Thank you, Tom.

960
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:10,206
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

961
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,808
Yeah, a million times.

962
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:19,481
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

963
01:20:19,484 --> 01:20:21,652
as soon as you
come out the door.

964
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:24,153
Let's go.

965
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:30,389
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

966
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:34,498
At least a year, Mike.

967
01:20:34,499 --> 01:20:38,060
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

968
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:42,572
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

969
01:20:42,674 --> 01:20:45,174
when I think the time is right.

970
01:20:50,348 --> 01:20:52,848
Take care.

971
01:20:55,019 --> 01:20:57,519
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

972
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,321
I'm glad you came, Mike.

973
01:21:31,322 --> 01:21:33,822
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

974
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:37,359
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

975
01:21:37,462 --> 01:21:39,329
It should have never happened.

976
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,498
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

977
01:21:41,499 --> 01:21:43,999
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

978
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:48,062
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

979
01:21:48,172 --> 01:21:51,403
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

980
01:21:51,509 --> 01:21:54,009
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

981
01:21:54,011 --> 01:21:56,511
You can't talk business
with him.

982
01:21:57,682 --> 01:22:00,182
He's a good kid.

983
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:06,021
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

984
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,625
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

985
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:12,127
On your knees, facing me.

986
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:18,868
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

987
01:22:19,971 --> 01:22:22,038
Too grouchy.

988
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:24,701
Can't stand the aggravation.

989
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:27,309
You know how it is.

990
01:22:28,146 --> 01:22:30,646
He's clean.

991
01:22:56,507 --> 01:22:59,007
We're going to Jersey?

992
01:23:00,678 --> 01:23:03,178
Maybe.

993
01:23:27,805 --> 01:23:30,305
Nice work, Lou.

994
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:09,045
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

995
01:24:09,046 --> 01:24:11,481
Good.
Try the veal.

996
01:24:11,482 --> 01:24:13,982
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

997
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,483
<i>Understand?</i>

998
01:24:49,987 --> 01:24:51,855
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

999
01:24:51,856 --> 01:24:54,356
Go ahead.

1000
01:24:59,256 --> 01:25:01,756
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1001
01:25:04,757 --> 01:25:10,757
What happened to
your father was business.

1002
01:25:12,758 --> 01:25:15,758
I have much respect for your father...

1003
01:25:15,759 --> 01:25:19,759
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1004
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,760
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1005
01:25:25,761 --> 01:25:28,761
I understand these things.

1006
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:30,962
I do.

1007
01:25:30,963 --> 01:25:33,463
You do.

1008
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:47,964
Now we have to think about what happens

1009
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:52,165
between you and the Tattaglias.

1010
01:25:52,965 --> 01:25:56,965
We have to work through

1011
01:25:56,966 --> 01:26:00,966
where we go from here.

1012
01:26:08,466 --> 01:26:10,966
How do I say...?

1013
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:15,270
What I want...

1014
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:17,939
what's most important to me...

1015
01:26:20,277 --> 01:26:22,445
is that I have a guarantee:

1016
01:26:22,446 --> 01:26:24,614
no more attempts
on my father's life.

1017
01:26:24,615 --> 01:26:28,847
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1018
01:26:29,453 --> 01:26:32,513
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1019
01:26:32,623 --> 01:26:35,123
I'm not that clever.

1020
01:26:36,293 --> 01:26:38,793
All I want is a truce.

1021
01:26:45,302 --> 01:26:48,999
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1022
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:52,807
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1023
01:26:58,449 --> 01:27:00,083
I frisked him.
He's clean.

1024
01:27:00,084 --> 01:27:02,584
Don't take too long.

1025
01:27:05,756 --> 01:27:08,256
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1026
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:26,054
Everything all right?

1027
01:28:27,055 --> 01:28:29,555
I respect myself...  understand?

1028
01:28:29,556 --> 01:28:32,556
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1029
01:28:33,357 --> 01:28:36,357
What happened was unavoidable.

1030
01:28:37,358 --> 01:28:39,858
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1031
01:28:39,859 --> 01:28:42,359
If your father were in better health...

1032
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,860
without his eldest son running things...

1033
01:30:58,689 --> 01:31:00,189
Hey, come on.

1034
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,690
Come on. Let's go.

1035
01:31:58,349 --> 01:32:00,849
Joe, you take over.

1036
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:06,187
Hi, Grandpa.

1037
01:32:17,634 --> 01:32:20,134
I love you, Grandpa.

1038
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,869
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1039
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:29,474
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1040
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,647
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1041
01:32:31,648 --> 01:32:33,649
and I wish
I would see you soon.

1042
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:36,150
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1043
01:32:38,655 --> 01:32:40,990
Go with your mother.

1044
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:43,491
Go ahead.
Take 'em downstairs.

1045
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:51,666
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1046
01:32:53,003 --> 01:32:55,503
Go on.

1047
01:32:58,008 --> 01:33:01,239
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1048
01:33:01,345 --> 01:33:03,246
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1049
01:33:03,247 --> 01:33:05,747
I know, but how much can you eat?

1050
01:33:15,292 --> 01:33:17,293
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1051
01:33:17,294 --> 01:33:19,794
Shut up and set the table.

1052
01:33:34,978 --> 01:33:37,538
Since McCluskey's killing...

1053
01:33:37,648 --> 01:33:41,049
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1054
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,320
And also the other families'.

1055
01:33:45,823 --> 01:33:47,623
Been a lot of bad blood.

1056
01:33:47,624 --> 01:33:51,116
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1057
01:33:51,995 --> 01:33:54,163
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1058
01:33:54,164 --> 01:33:56,499
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1059
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,901
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1060
01:34:01,171 --> 01:34:03,671
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1061
01:34:04,274 --> 01:34:09,007
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1062
01:34:09,113 --> 01:34:11,707
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1063
01:34:11,815 --> 01:34:13,783
I want him to rest.

1064
01:34:13,784 --> 01:34:16,284
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1065
01:34:16,286 --> 01:34:18,786
Yeah.

1066
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:26,961
Where is Michael?

1067
01:34:38,809 --> 01:34:41,403
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1068
01:34:43,814 --> 01:34:47,545
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1069
01:35:09,273 --> 01:35:11,440
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1070
01:35:11,441 --> 01:35:13,442
I want his ass now...
right now.

1071
01:35:13,443 --> 01:35:15,278
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1072
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:17,113
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1073
01:35:17,114 --> 01:35:19,844
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1074
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:21,951
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1075
01:35:21,952 --> 01:35:24,452
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what...

1076
01:35:24,454 --> 01:35:26,455
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1077
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:28,291
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1078
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:31,022
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1079
01:35:31,128 --> 01:35:33,129
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1080
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:35,131
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1081
01:35:35,132 --> 01:35:37,300
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1082
01:35:37,301 --> 01:35:38,968
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1083
01:35:38,969 --> 01:35:41,137
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1084
01:35:41,138 --> 01:35:43,139
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1085
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,640
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1086
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:51,479
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1087
01:35:52,482 --> 01:35:55,508
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1088
01:35:56,486 --> 01:35:59,216
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1089
01:35:59,323 --> 01:36:00,990
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1090
01:36:00,991 --> 01:36:04,825
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1091
01:36:04,928 --> 01:36:08,329
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1092
01:36:08,432 --> 01:36:11,993
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1093
01:36:12,102 --> 01:36:14,832
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1094
01:36:14,938 --> 01:36:17,998
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1095
01:36:19,943 --> 01:36:22,543
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1096
01:36:22,613 --> 01:36:24,614
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1097
01:36:24,615 --> 01:36:27,115
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1098
01:37:20,037 --> 01:37:21,537
Michael

1099
01:37:52,038 --> 01:37:54,538
Corleone.

1100
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:26,039
Look there. Corleone.

1101
01:39:03,376 --> 01:39:06,709
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1102
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:08,276
Hey, hey, hey!

1103
01:39:08,315 --> 01:39:11,375
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1104
01:39:11,876 --> 01:39:13,376
America! America!

1105
01:39:13,377 --> 01:39:14,877
Take me to the America, G.I.

1106
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:16,878
Clark Gable.
Rita Hayworth.

1107
01:40:10,196 --> 01:40:12,196
Hey, host.

1108
01:40:13,897 --> 01:40:15,897
A bottle of wine.

1109
01:42:11,197 --> 01:42:13,697
I apologize if I offended you.

1110
01:42:14,534 --> 01:42:17,034
I'm a stranger in this country...

1111
01:42:17,537 --> 01:42:20,438
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1112
01:42:26,212 --> 01:42:28,712
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1113
01:42:30,383 --> 01:42:32,883
My name is Michael Corleone.

1114
01:42:34,721 --> 01:42:37,362
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1115
01:42:41,227 --> 01:42:43,727
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1116
01:42:45,665 --> 01:42:48,165
instead of gaining a husband.

1117
01:42:55,909 --> 01:42:58,409
I want to meet your daughter...

1118
01:42:59,245 --> 01:43:01,079
with your permission...

1119
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,580
and under the supervision
of your family...

1120
01:43:04,517 --> 01:43:07,017
with all respect.

1121
01:43:24,704 --> 01:43:27,204
Apollonia.

1122
01:44:21,705 --> 01:44:24,705
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1123
01:44:24,706 --> 01:44:27,706
and this is Michael Corleone.

1124
01:44:43,707 --> 01:44:45,707
Thank you.

1125
01:44:46,308 --> 01:44:48,308
Your welcome.

1126
01:44:58,309 --> 01:45:00,809
What's the problem with your eye.

1127
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:03,810
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1128
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:21,011
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1129
01:46:26,519 --> 01:46:29,019
Save it for the library.

1130
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:34,658
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1131
01:46:52,879 --> 01:46:55,379
What's the matter?

1132
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,180
What's the matter?

1133
01:47:00,386 --> 01:47:02,554
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1134
01:47:02,555 --> 01:47:05,956
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1135
01:47:06,059 --> 01:47:07,993
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1136
01:47:07,994 --> 01:47:10,494
I'm sorry.

1137
01:47:14,468 --> 01:47:17,798
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1138
01:47:18,004 --> 01:47:20,734
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1139
01:47:22,842 --> 01:47:25,010
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1140
01:47:25,011 --> 01:47:27,809
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1141
01:47:30,683 --> 01:47:32,184
All right?

1142
01:47:32,185 --> 01:47:35,279
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1143
01:47:35,388 --> 01:47:37,888
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1144
01:47:39,058 --> 01:47:41,558
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1145
01:47:47,433 --> 01:47:49,933
Carlo, come here.

1146
01:48:47,026 --> 01:48:49,756
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1147
01:52:45,097 --> 01:52:47,827
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1148
01:52:47,933 --> 01:52:52,233
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1149
01:52:52,338 --> 01:52:54,706
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1150
01:52:54,707 --> 01:52:58,108
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1151
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,381
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1152
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:06,078
But nobody was hurt.

1153
01:53:06,152 --> 01:53:07,152
Tom...

1154
01:53:07,653 --> 01:53:11,487
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1155
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:13,925
Well, if I accepted that...

1156
01:53:13,926 --> 01:53:17,487
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1157
01:53:17,596 --> 01:53:19,798
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1158
01:53:19,799 --> 01:53:23,701
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1159
01:53:23,803 --> 01:53:26,303
Come on. I'm sorry.
Come on.

1160
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:45,121
Hello?

1161
01:53:46,692 --> 01:53:48,460
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1162
01:53:48,461 --> 01:53:50,929
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1163
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:53,990
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1164
01:54:00,206 --> 01:54:02,706
Bitch.

1165
01:54:03,476 --> 01:54:06,070
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1166
01:54:06,178 --> 01:54:08,179
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1167
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:11,240
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1168
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:13,351
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1169
01:54:13,352 --> 01:54:15,852
Go fuck yourself!

1170
01:54:20,559 --> 01:54:23,059
This little guinea brat.

1171
01:54:27,466 --> 01:54:30,060
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1172
01:54:30,169 --> 01:54:32,669
Break it all!

1173
01:54:35,374 --> 01:54:37,874
That's it. Break it all.

1174
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:45,178
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1175
01:54:45,284 --> 01:54:47,784
Maybe I will.
Why not?

1176
01:54:53,459 --> 01:54:55,927
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1177
01:54:55,928 --> 01:54:58,428
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1178
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,930
Clean it up!
Clean it up!

1179
01:55:05,337 --> 01:55:07,837
You son of a bitch!

1180
01:55:16,515 --> 01:55:19,609
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1181
01:55:19,718 --> 01:55:22,053
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1182
01:55:22,054 --> 01:55:23,788
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1183
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:26,289
Kill me!
Get up!

1184
01:55:26,292 --> 01:55:27,926
Get out of here!

1185
01:55:27,927 --> 01:55:31,419
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1186
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:33,531
You guinea brat, you.

1187
01:55:33,532 --> 01:55:36,032
Get out here!

1188
01:55:44,877 --> 01:55:47,812
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1189
01:55:48,981 --> 01:55:51,848
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1190
01:55:51,951 --> 01:55:53,985
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1191
01:55:53,986 --> 01:55:56,054
I don't understand.

1192
01:55:56,055 --> 01:55:58,555
Yeah, Connie.

1193
01:56:03,095 --> 01:56:05,595
Listen, you wait there.

1194
01:56:07,466 --> 01:56:09,966
No, you just wait there.

1195
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:14,671
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1196
01:56:14,773 --> 01:56:16,908
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1197
01:56:16,909 --> 01:56:19,409
Damn it!

1198
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:24,208
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1199
01:56:40,733 --> 01:56:43,566
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1200
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:46,169
Go after him.
Go on.

1201
01:57:14,566 --> 01:57:16,501
Son of a bitch.

1202
01:57:16,502 --> 01:57:19,002
Come on! Come on!

1203
01:59:06,078 --> 01:59:08,578
Give me a drop.

1204
01:59:16,188 --> 01:59:18,688
My wife is crying upstairs.

1205
01:59:20,859 --> 01:59:23,359
I hear cars coming to the house.

1206
01:59:27,933 --> 01:59:30,433
Consigliere of mine...

1207
01:59:31,303 --> 01:59:34,238
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1208
01:59:34,339 --> 01:59:36,839
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1209
01:59:38,043 --> 01:59:41,570
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1210
01:59:44,716 --> 01:59:47,216
But you needed a drink first.

1211
01:59:53,792 --> 01:59:56,292
Now you've had your drink.

1212
02:00:01,834 --> 02:00:05,998
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1213
02:00:23,288 --> 02:00:25,788
I want all inquiries made.

1214
02:00:29,962 --> 02:00:32,462
I want no acts of vengeance.

1215
02:00:33,999 --> 02:00:36,499
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1216
02:00:37,803 --> 02:00:40,303
with the heads
of the five families.

1217
02:00:42,541 --> 02:00:45,041
This war stops now.

1218
02:01:06,498 --> 02:01:09,023
Call Bonasera.

1219
02:01:09,134 --> 02:01:11,634
We need him now.

1220
02:01:23,482 --> 02:01:26,451
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1221
02:01:26,552 --> 02:01:28,653
at his request.

1222
02:01:28,654 --> 02:01:30,955
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1223
02:01:30,956 --> 02:01:34,790
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1224
02:01:34,893 --> 02:01:37,657
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1225
02:01:37,763 --> 02:01:40,263
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1226
02:02:00,485 --> 02:02:02,820
Well, my friend...

1227
02:02:02,821 --> 02:02:05,289
are you ready
to do me this service?

1228
02:02:05,290 --> 02:02:06,958
Yes.

1229
02:02:06,959 --> 02:02:09,484
What do you want me to do?

1230
02:02:16,835 --> 02:02:19,861
I want you to use
all your powers...

1231
02:02:19,972 --> 02:02:22,472
and all your skills.

1232
02:02:25,477 --> 02:02:27,977
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1233
02:02:44,529 --> 02:02:47,029
Look how they massacred my boy.

1234
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:23,801
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1235
02:03:23,802 --> 02:03:26,430
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1236
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:01,330
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1237
02:05:02,467 --> 02:05:04,135
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1238
02:05:04,136 --> 02:05:06,437
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1239
02:05:06,438 --> 02:05:09,999
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1240
02:05:10,108 --> 02:05:12,608
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1241
02:06:21,646 --> 02:06:23,581
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1242
02:06:23,582 --> 02:06:27,109
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1243
02:06:27,219 --> 02:06:30,586
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1244
02:06:30,689 --> 02:06:33,189
from New York and New Jersey.

1245
02:06:34,192 --> 02:06:37,218
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1246
02:06:39,698 --> 02:06:42,198
From Brooklyn...

1247
02:06:42,367 --> 02:06:44,867
Philip Tattaglia.

1248
02:06:46,271 --> 02:06:49,104
And from Staten Island...

1249
02:06:49,207 --> 02:06:52,472
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1250
02:06:52,577 --> 02:06:55,077
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1251
02:06:55,146 --> 02:06:58,274
as from California
and Kansas City...

1252
02:06:58,383 --> 02:07:00,818
and all the other territories
of the country.

1253
02:07:00,819 --> 02:07:03,319
Thank you.

1254
02:07:08,927 --> 02:07:11,427
How did things ever get so far?

1255
02:07:12,464 --> 02:07:14,964
I don't know.

1256
02:07:16,201 --> 02:07:19,693
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1257
02:07:22,774 --> 02:07:25,009
Tattaglia lost a son...

1258
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:27,510
and I lost a son.

1259
02:07:28,246 --> 02:07:31,841
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1260
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:36,011
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1261
02:07:37,656 --> 02:07:41,183
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1262
02:07:41,293 --> 02:07:43,989
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1263
02:07:44,095 --> 02:07:46,330
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1264
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:48,831
Yes, Don Barzini.

1265
02:07:48,867 --> 02:07:50,935
He's too modest.

1266
02:07:50,936 --> 02:07:53,905
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1267
02:07:55,307 --> 02:07:58,140
He refused to share them.

1268
02:07:58,243 --> 02:08:01,235
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1269
02:08:02,113 --> 02:08:04,613
All of you know me here.

1270
02:08:05,483 --> 02:08:09,510
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1271
02:08:09,621 --> 02:08:12,121
And why?

1272
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:14,790
Because I believe
this drug business...

1273
02:08:14,893 --> 02:08:18,021
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1274
02:08:18,129 --> 02:08:21,860
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1275
02:08:21,967 --> 02:08:24,697
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1276
02:08:24,803 --> 02:08:28,261
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1277
02:08:28,373 --> 02:08:31,467
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1278
02:08:31,576 --> 02:08:33,410
with gambling and other things...

1279
02:08:33,411 --> 02:08:37,541
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1280
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:40,584
And I believed that then...

1281
02:08:40,685 --> 02:08:42,820
and I believe that now.

1282
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:45,122
Times have changed.

1283
02:08:45,123 --> 02:08:47,391
It's not like the old days...

1284
02:08:47,392 --> 02:08:49,892
when we could do
anything we want.

1285
02:08:49,928 --> 02:08:52,829
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1286
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:56,867
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1287
02:08:56,968 --> 02:08:59,960
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1288
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:03,234
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1289
02:09:04,175 --> 02:09:07,736
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1290
02:09:07,846 --> 02:09:10,576
After all, we are not Communists.

1291
02:09:13,551 --> 02:09:16,611
I also don't believe in drugs.

1292
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:18,956
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1293
02:09:18,957 --> 02:09:21,358
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1294
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:24,795
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1295
02:09:24,896 --> 02:09:27,626
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1296
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:31,262
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1297
02:09:32,370 --> 02:09:36,170
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1298
02:09:36,274 --> 02:09:38,742
to keep it respectable.

1299
02:09:38,743 --> 02:09:43,271
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1300
02:09:43,381 --> 02:09:45,881
That's an infamia.

1301
02:09:46,418 --> 02:09:50,354
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1302
02:09:50,455 --> 02:09:53,322
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1303
02:10:00,298 --> 02:10:03,597
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1304
02:10:05,336 --> 02:10:08,499
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1305
02:10:08,606 --> 02:10:12,098
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1306
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:14,378
Then we are agreed.

1307
02:10:14,379 --> 02:10:16,814
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1308
02:10:16,815 --> 02:10:19,375
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1309
02:10:19,484 --> 02:10:21,418
and there will be the peace.

1310
02:10:21,419 --> 02:10:25,287
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1311
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:28,553
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1312
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:31,185
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1313
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:33,363
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1314
02:10:33,364 --> 02:10:36,800
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1315
02:10:36,901 --> 02:10:39,136
You talk about vengeance.

1316
02:10:39,137 --> 02:10:42,402
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1317
02:10:42,507 --> 02:10:45,007
Or my boy to me?

1318
02:10:45,677 --> 02:10:48,177
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1319
02:10:51,316 --> 02:10:53,816
But I have selfish reasons.

1320
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,855
My youngest son...

1321
02:10:57,856 --> 02:11:00,356
was forced to leave this country...

1322
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:03,859
because of this Sollozzo business.

1323
02:11:04,329 --> 02:11:07,162
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1324
02:11:07,265 --> 02:11:11,895
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1325
02:11:13,538 --> 02:11:16,564
But I'm a superstitious man.

1326
02:11:16,674 --> 02:11:19,234
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1327
02:11:19,344 --> 02:11:23,075
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1328
02:11:23,181 --> 02:11:27,015
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1329
02:11:27,118 --> 02:11:29,618
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1330
02:11:31,256 --> 02:11:34,282
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1331
02:11:36,494 --> 02:11:38,994
And that I do not forgive.

1332
02:11:41,332 --> 02:11:43,832
But that aside...

1333
02:11:46,771 --> 02:11:49,271
let me say that I swear...

1334
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:53,802
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1335
02:11:53,912 --> 02:11:57,439
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1336
02:12:23,841 --> 02:12:25,842
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1337
02:12:25,843 --> 02:12:29,210
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1338
02:12:29,314 --> 02:12:31,814
Mention it.
Don't insist.

1339
02:12:33,651 --> 02:12:36,151
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1340
02:12:37,488 --> 02:12:40,082
You mean Tattaglia.

1341
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:42,921
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1342
02:12:43,027 --> 02:12:45,527
He never could've outfought Santino.

1343
02:12:48,866 --> 02:12:52,529
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1344
02:12:52,637 --> 02:12:55,137
Barzini all along.

1345
02:13:09,787 --> 02:13:12,287
Come on, Nancy.

1346
02:13:12,991 --> 02:13:15,491
Keep together, everyone.
Brian?

1347
02:13:16,861 --> 02:13:19,361
Okay. All right.

1348
02:13:31,909 --> 02:13:34,434
How long have you been back?

1349
02:13:34,545 --> 02:13:37,045
I've been back a year.

1350
02:13:37,982 --> 02:13:40,507
Longer than that, I think.

1351
02:13:42,754 --> 02:13:45,254
It's good to see you, Kay.

1352
02:13:51,162 --> 02:13:53,662
Hi, Miss Adams!

1353
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,500
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1354
02:14:01,139 --> 02:14:03,173
He's been sick.

1355
02:14:03,174 --> 02:14:05,609
Very sick.

1356
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:07,711
But you're not like him, Michael.

1357
02:14:07,712 --> 02:14:10,237
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1358
02:14:10,348 --> 02:14:12,848
That's what you told me.

1359
02:14:13,384 --> 02:14:16,114
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1360
02:14:17,789 --> 02:14:21,350
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1361
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:24,960
Like a senator or a president.

1362
02:14:24,962 --> 02:14:27,487
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1363
02:14:27,598 --> 02:14:30,192
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1364
02:14:31,537 --> 02:14:32,537
Oh.

1365
02:14:33,538 --> 02:14:36,038
Who's being naive, Kay?

1366
02:14:36,674 --> 02:14:38,909
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1367
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:42,402
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1368
02:14:42,513 --> 02:14:44,548
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1369
02:14:44,549 --> 02:14:47,049
is going to be completely legitimate.

1370
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:51,687
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1371
02:14:51,688 --> 02:14:52,688
Kay.

1372
02:14:54,158 --> 02:14:56,526
Michael, why did you come here?

1373
02:14:56,527 --> 02:14:58,729
Why?

1374
02:14:58,730 --> 02:15:00,797
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1375
02:15:00,798 --> 02:15:03,323
without even calling or writing?

1376
02:15:03,434 --> 02:15:05,435
I came here because I need you.

1377
02:15:05,436 --> 02:15:07,961
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1378
02:15:08,072 --> 02:15:11,200
Because I want you to marry me.

1379
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:15,210
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1380
02:15:16,914 --> 02:15:20,782
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1381
02:15:22,587 --> 02:15:24,921
Because that's important, Kay.

1382
02:15:24,922 --> 02:15:28,414
Because what's important is that...

1383
02:15:28,526 --> 02:15:30,360
we have each other.

1384
02:15:30,361 --> 02:15:33,262
That we have a life together.

1385
02:15:33,364 --> 02:15:36,822
That we have children.
Our children.

1386
02:15:37,323 --> 02:15:38,323
Kay...

1387
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:41,700
I need you...

1388
02:15:41,806 --> 02:15:44,306
and I love you.

1389
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:07,431
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1390
02:16:07,432 --> 02:16:09,299
and we do nothing about it.

1391
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,981
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1392
02:16:12,036 --> 02:16:14,561
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1393
02:16:14,672 --> 02:16:17,197
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1394
02:16:17,308 --> 02:16:19,443
We gotta protect ourselves.

1395
02:16:19,444 --> 02:16:21,445
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1396
02:16:21,446 --> 02:16:23,079
No.

1397
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:25,580
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1398
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:28,175
Mike, you're wrong.

1399
02:16:28,286 --> 02:16:31,915
Don Corleone, you once said
that the day would come...

1400
02:16:32,023 --> 02:16:34,719
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1401
02:16:34,826 --> 02:16:36,827
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1402
02:16:36,828 --> 02:16:39,196
I must ask your permission.

1403
02:16:39,197 --> 02:16:42,428
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1404
02:16:42,533 --> 02:16:45,229
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1405
02:16:46,804 --> 02:16:49,304
After we make the move to Nevada...

1406
02:16:49,407 --> 02:16:52,399
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1407
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:55,308
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1408
02:16:56,547 --> 02:16:58,181
Six months.

1409
02:16:58,182 --> 02:17:01,640
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1410
02:17:01,752 --> 02:17:04,721
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1411
02:17:04,822 --> 02:17:07,322
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1412
02:17:07,358 --> 02:17:10,293
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1413
02:17:10,394 --> 02:17:13,386
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1414
02:17:13,498 --> 02:17:16,296
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1415
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,668
Then be a friend to Michael...

1416
02:17:18,669 --> 02:17:21,169
and do as he says.

1417
02:17:24,609 --> 02:17:26,810
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1418
02:17:26,811 --> 02:17:29,905
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1419
02:17:30,014 --> 02:17:32,514
That's all I can tell you now.

1420
02:17:33,017 --> 02:17:35,645
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1421
02:17:35,753 --> 02:17:38,916
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1422
02:17:39,023 --> 02:17:41,719
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1423
02:17:41,826 --> 02:17:44,326
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1424
02:17:44,328 --> 02:17:46,796
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1425
02:17:46,797 --> 02:17:48,732
Besides, if I ever need help...

1426
02:17:48,733 --> 02:17:51,034
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1427
02:17:51,035 --> 02:17:53,535
Now that's it.

1428
02:18:11,622 --> 02:18:14,122
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1429
02:18:15,528 --> 02:18:19,758
Mike, ehh...
Why am I out?

1430
02:18:19,864 --> 02:18:22,364
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1431
02:18:23,935 --> 02:18:26,435
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1432
02:18:27,136 --> 02:18:28,136
Tom...

1433
02:18:33,711 --> 02:18:35,979
I advised Michael.

1434
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:38,881
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1435
02:18:38,983 --> 02:18:42,248
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1436
02:18:42,353 --> 02:18:44,621
rest in peace.

1437
02:18:44,622 --> 02:18:47,648
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1438
02:18:48,859 --> 02:18:52,386
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1439
02:18:52,496 --> 02:18:54,731
in what is going to happen.

1440
02:18:54,732 --> 02:18:56,232
Maybe I could help.

1441
02:18:56,233 --> 02:18:58,733
You're out, Tom.

1442
02:19:47,151 --> 02:19:49,676
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1443
02:19:49,787 --> 02:19:52,950
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1444
02:19:53,057 --> 02:19:55,685
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1445
02:19:55,793 --> 02:19:58,194
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1446
02:19:58,195 --> 02:20:00,196
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1447
02:20:00,197 --> 02:20:03,257
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1448
02:20:08,806 --> 02:20:11,141
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1449
02:20:11,142 --> 02:20:14,407
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1450
02:20:14,512 --> 02:20:17,310
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1451
02:20:21,052 --> 02:20:23,850
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1452
02:20:23,954 --> 02:20:26,889
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1453
02:20:26,991 --> 02:20:29,491
Who are the girls?

1454
02:20:30,061 --> 02:20:32,062
That's for you to find out.

1455
02:20:32,063 --> 02:20:34,930
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1456
02:20:35,032 --> 02:20:37,167
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1457
02:20:37,168 --> 02:20:40,899
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1458
02:20:41,005 --> 02:20:43,505
Get rid of the band too.

1459
02:20:48,479 --> 02:20:51,277
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1460
02:20:51,382 --> 02:20:54,647
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1461
02:20:54,752 --> 02:20:56,786
Let's go.
Hey, come on!

1462
02:20:56,787 --> 02:20:59,287
Scram!

1463
02:20:59,557 --> 02:21:01,925
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1464
02:21:01,926 --> 02:21:04,094
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1465
02:21:04,095 --> 02:21:06,396
It's all right, Freddy.

1466
02:21:06,397 --> 02:21:08,897
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1467
02:21:15,906 --> 02:21:18,406
What happened to Moe Greene?

1468
02:21:19,009 --> 02:21:21,509
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1469
02:21:21,512 --> 02:21:23,480
when the party started.

1470
02:21:23,481 --> 02:21:25,981
Well, give him a call.

1471
02:21:26,784 --> 02:21:29,878
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1472
02:21:29,987 --> 02:21:32,155
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1473
02:21:32,156 --> 02:21:34,557
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1474
02:21:34,558 --> 02:21:38,995
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1475
02:21:39,096 --> 02:21:41,131
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1476
02:21:41,132 --> 02:21:44,192
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1477
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:46,801
Mike, what can I do?

1478
02:21:47,605 --> 02:21:50,165
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1479
02:21:50,174 --> 02:21:53,575
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1480
02:21:53,677 --> 02:21:56,942
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1481
02:21:57,047 --> 02:21:59,641
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1482
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:02,051
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1483
02:22:02,052 --> 02:22:04,919
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1484
02:22:05,022 --> 02:22:07,522
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1485
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:11,694
See, Johnny...

1486
02:22:11,695 --> 02:22:13,997
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1487
02:22:13,998 --> 02:22:15,799
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1488
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,099
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1489
02:22:22,606 --> 02:22:25,871
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1490
02:22:25,976 --> 02:22:28,476
to do the same.

1491
02:22:28,546 --> 02:22:31,046
We're counting on you.

1492
02:22:32,650 --> 02:22:35,175
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1493
02:22:35,286 --> 02:22:36,619
You know that.

1494
02:22:36,620 --> 02:22:39,120
Good.

1495
02:22:39,256 --> 02:22:41,491
Hey, Mike.
Hello, fellas.

1496
02:22:41,492 --> 02:22:45,189
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1497
02:22:45,296 --> 02:22:47,330
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1498
02:22:47,331 --> 02:22:50,027
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1499
02:22:50,134 --> 02:22:51,901
and your credit is good.

1500
02:22:51,902 --> 02:22:54,543
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1501
02:22:58,108 --> 02:23:00,608
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1502
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:04,514
Buy me out?

1503
02:23:04,515 --> 02:23:07,177
The casino. The hotel.

1504
02:23:07,284 --> 02:23:10,048
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1505
02:23:10,154 --> 02:23:13,021
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1506
02:23:13,123 --> 02:23:15,623
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1507
02:23:15,659 --> 02:23:18,924
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1508
02:23:19,029 --> 02:23:21,529
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1509
02:23:22,333 --> 02:23:24,833
You're unlucky.

1510
02:23:28,005 --> 02:23:30,473
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1511
02:23:30,474 --> 02:23:33,307
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1512
02:23:33,410 --> 02:23:35,879
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1513
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:38,474
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1514
02:23:38,582 --> 02:23:41,082
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1515
02:23:41,185 --> 02:23:43,319
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1516
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:45,388
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1517
02:23:45,389 --> 02:23:48,119
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1518
02:23:48,225 --> 02:23:50,693
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1519
02:23:50,694 --> 02:23:53,194
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1520
02:23:53,230 --> 02:23:55,031
by Barzini and the other families.

1521
02:23:55,032 --> 02:23:58,934
What do you think is going on here? You think
you can come to my hotel and take over?

1522
02:23:59,036 --> 02:24:00,870
I talked to Barzini.

1523
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:04,136
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1524
02:24:04,241 --> 02:24:06,835
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1525
02:24:07,912 --> 02:24:09,613
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1526
02:24:09,914 --> 02:24:12,474
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1527
02:24:12,583 --> 02:24:15,083
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1528
02:24:15,085 --> 02:24:17,220
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1529
02:24:17,221 --> 02:24:19,088
I got a business to run.

1530
02:24:19,089 --> 02:24:21,819
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1531
02:24:21,926 --> 02:24:25,919
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1532
02:24:26,030 --> 02:24:28,624
You straightened my brother out?

1533
02:24:28,732 --> 02:24:31,232
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1534
02:24:31,235 --> 02:24:34,136
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1535
02:24:40,177 --> 02:24:43,669
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1536
02:24:43,781 --> 02:24:45,481
Son of a bitch.

1537
02:24:45,482 --> 02:24:48,508
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1538
02:24:48,619 --> 02:24:51,213
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1539
02:24:51,322 --> 02:24:53,822
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1540
02:24:54,825 --> 02:24:58,022
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1541
02:24:58,128 --> 02:25:00,129
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1542
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:03,725
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1543
02:25:03,834 --> 02:25:06,394
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1544
02:25:11,276 --> 02:25:15,871
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1545
02:25:18,217 --> 02:25:22,947
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1546
02:25:24,455 --> 02:25:26,522
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1547
02:25:26,523 --> 02:25:29,424
against the family again...

1548
02:25:29,526 --> 02:25:32,026
ever.

1549
02:25:38,836 --> 02:25:41,004
I have to see my father
and his people.

1550
02:25:41,005 --> 02:25:43,505
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1551
02:25:45,009 --> 02:25:47,276
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1552
02:25:47,277 --> 02:25:49,777
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1553
02:25:57,221 --> 02:26:00,122
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1554
02:26:00,224 --> 02:26:02,358
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1555
02:26:02,359 --> 02:26:05,590
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1556
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:07,563
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1557
02:26:07,564 --> 02:26:10,064
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1558
02:26:16,673 --> 02:26:18,608
So...

1559
02:26:18,609 --> 02:26:21,578
Barzini will move against you first.

1560
02:26:21,678 --> 02:26:26,012
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1561
02:26:26,116 --> 02:26:28,616
guaranteeing your safety.

1562
02:26:29,453 --> 02:26:32,718
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1563
02:26:37,361 --> 02:26:40,558
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1564
02:26:41,732 --> 02:26:43,900
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1565
02:26:43,901 --> 02:26:46,401
It's good for you, Pop.

1566
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,840
I don't know.

1567
02:26:53,744 --> 02:26:56,244
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1568
02:26:57,648 --> 02:26:59,715
Very happy.

1569
02:26:59,716 --> 02:27:02,241
That's good.

1570
02:27:02,352 --> 02:27:04,620
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1571
02:27:04,621 --> 02:27:07,215
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1572
02:27:07,324 --> 02:27:09,392
No, not at all.

1573
02:27:09,393 --> 02:27:11,761
It's an old habit.

1574
02:27:11,762 --> 02:27:14,526
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1575
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:19,233
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1576
02:27:23,107 --> 02:27:25,667
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1577
02:27:25,776 --> 02:27:28,276
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1578
02:27:31,081 --> 02:27:33,349
He's smarter than I am.

1579
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,850
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1580
02:27:37,654 --> 02:27:40,154
Reads the funny papers.

1581
02:27:46,897 --> 02:27:49,397
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1582
02:27:49,399 --> 02:27:52,527
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1583
02:27:52,636 --> 02:27:54,770
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1584
02:27:54,771 --> 02:27:58,298
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1585
02:28:02,012 --> 02:28:04,413
What's the matter?

1586
02:28:04,414 --> 02:28:06,914
What's bothering you?

1587
02:28:09,686 --> 02:28:12,186
I'll handle it.

1588
02:28:12,589 --> 02:28:15,089
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1589
02:28:28,138 --> 02:28:32,472
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1590
02:28:32,576 --> 02:28:34,477
and Fredo...

1591
02:28:34,478 --> 02:28:36,946
Well...

1592
02:28:36,947 --> 02:28:39,447
Fredo was...

1593
02:28:40,984 --> 02:28:43,748
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1594
02:28:46,023 --> 02:28:48,856
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1595
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:51,127
to take care of my family...

1596
02:28:51,128 --> 02:28:54,996
and I refused to be a fool...

1597
02:28:55,098 --> 02:28:59,159
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1598
02:29:01,271 --> 02:29:04,434
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1599
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:09,004
that when it was your time...

1600
02:29:09,112 --> 02:29:11,612
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1601
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:15,950
Senator Corleone.

1602
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:19,088
Governor Corleone.
Something.

1603
02:29:19,089 --> 02:29:21,589
Another pezzonovante.

1604
02:29:27,097 --> 02:29:30,931
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1605
02:29:31,034 --> 02:29:33,628
We'll get there, Pop.

1606
02:29:33,737 --> 02:29:36,237
We'll get there.

1607
02:29:39,476 --> 02:29:43,845
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1608
02:29:43,947 --> 02:29:45,715
he's the traitor.

1609
02:29:45,716 --> 02:29:48,216
Don't forget that.

1610
02:30:03,967 --> 02:30:06,467
Put it over the tree.

1611
02:30:21,251 --> 02:30:23,719
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1612
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,288
That's fine.

1613
02:30:25,289 --> 02:30:27,789
Over here.
Over here.

1614
02:30:29,893 --> 02:30:32,393
Be careful.
You're spilling it.

1615
02:30:38,702 --> 02:30:41,202
Anthony, come here.

1616
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:49,110
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1617
02:30:54,918 --> 02:30:57,418
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1618
02:30:59,923 --> 02:31:02,423
Now, you stand there.

1619
02:31:05,529 --> 02:31:08,029
Give me an orange!

1620
02:31:25,615 --> 02:31:28,115
That's a new trick.

1621
02:31:28,685 --> 02:31:31,245
You run in there.
Run in there.

1622
02:31:43,867 --> 02:31:46,367
- Where are you?
- Who?

1623
02:32:19,503 --> 02:32:22,003
Ouch!

1624
02:34:43,547 --> 02:34:46,047
Mike, can I have a minute?

1625
02:34:56,393 --> 02:34:58,861
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1626
02:34:58,862 --> 02:35:01,362
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1627
02:35:03,033 --> 02:35:05,533
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1628
02:35:06,469 --> 02:35:08,904
I can arrange security...

1629
02:35:08,905 --> 02:35:11,405
on my territory.

1630
02:35:13,343 --> 02:35:15,344
All right?

1631
02:35:15,345 --> 02:35:18,178
- All right.
- All right.

1632
02:35:33,463 --> 02:35:35,963
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1633
02:35:38,902 --> 02:35:41,337
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1634
02:35:41,338 --> 02:35:43,838
Tessio's ground...

1635
02:35:44,708 --> 02:35:47,208
where I'll be safe.

1636
02:35:58,755 --> 02:36:02,350
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1637
02:36:02,459 --> 02:36:04,827
It's the smart move.

1638
02:36:04,828 --> 02:36:07,328
Tessio was always smarter.

1639
02:36:08,531 --> 02:36:10,833
But I'm gonna wait.

1640
02:36:10,834 --> 02:36:13,334
After the baptism.

1641
02:36:15,305 --> 02:36:17,865
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1642
02:36:19,209 --> 02:36:22,144
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1643
02:36:22,245 --> 02:36:24,713
and Tattaglia...

1644
02:36:24,714 --> 02:36:27,214
all the heads
of the five families.

1645
02:36:53,715 --> 02:36:55,715
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1646
02:36:55,916 --> 02:36:59,116
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1647
02:37:01,117 --> 02:37:02,117
Let us pray.

1648
02:37:02,118 --> 02:37:05,118
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1649
02:37:05,719 --> 02:37:06,719
Michael.

1650
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:09,720
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1651
02:37:10,721 --> 02:37:13,721
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1652
02:37:13,722 --> 02:37:16,722
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1653
02:37:16,723 --> 02:37:19,723
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1654
02:37:19,724 --> 02:37:22,724
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1655
02:37:22,725 --> 02:37:25,725
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1656
02:37:25,726 --> 02:37:28,226
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1657
02:37:28,227 --> 02:37:31,227
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1658
02:37:31,228 --> 02:37:34,228
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1659
02:37:34,229 --> 02:37:37,229
and the world by fire. So be it.

1660
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:39,530
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1661
02:37:39,531 --> 02:37:41,831
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1662
02:37:41,832 --> 02:37:43,832
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1663
02:37:43,833 --> 02:37:46,333
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1664
02:37:46,334 --> 02:37:48,834
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1665
02:37:49,835 --> 02:37:52,335
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1666
02:37:52,836 --> 02:37:56,336
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1667
02:37:56,337 --> 02:37:59,337
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1668
02:38:00,338 --> 02:38:03,638
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1669
02:38:03,939 --> 02:38:06,939
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1670
02:38:14,340 --> 02:38:17,340
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1671
02:38:17,341 --> 02:38:20,341
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1672
02:38:20,342 --> 02:38:23,842
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1673
02:38:24,843 --> 02:38:27,843
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1674
02:38:27,844 --> 02:38:30,844
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1675
02:38:30,845 --> 02:38:34,845
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1676
02:38:34,846 --> 02:38:38,346
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1677
02:38:40,147 --> 02:38:43,147
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1678
02:38:43,148 --> 02:38:46,148
Be thou, devil, begone,

1679
02:38:46,149 --> 02:38:48,449
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1680
02:38:48,491 --> 02:38:51,392
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1681
02:38:51,494 --> 02:38:54,463
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1682
02:38:54,564 --> 02:38:57,863
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1683
02:38:57,967 --> 02:38:59,468
<i>I do.</i>

1684
02:38:59,469 --> 02:39:03,633
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1685
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,640
<i>I do.</i>

1686
02:39:04,941 --> 02:39:08,841
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1687
02:39:08,842 --> 02:39:12,842
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1688
02:39:12,843 --> 02:39:15,643
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1689
02:39:15,644 --> 02:39:17,644
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1690
02:39:17,845 --> 02:39:20,938
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1691
02:39:20,939 --> 02:39:23,939
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1692
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:25,940
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1693
02:39:25,941 --> 02:39:27,441
Michael.

1694
02:39:27,442 --> 02:39:30,442
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1695
02:39:30,443 --> 02:39:33,443
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1696
02:39:33,444 --> 02:39:35,944
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1697
02:39:35,945 --> 02:39:37,945
Creator of heaven and earth,

1698
02:39:37,946 --> 02:39:41,446
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1699
02:39:41,447 --> 02:39:43,747
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1700
02:39:43,748 --> 02:39:45,748
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1701
02:39:45,749 --> 02:39:49,049
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1702
02:39:49,051 --> 02:39:51,751
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1703
02:39:51,752 --> 02:39:55,752
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1704
02:39:55,753 --> 02:39:58,553
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1705
02:39:58,554 --> 02:40:01,054
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1706
02:40:01,055 --> 02:40:04,055
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1707
02:40:04,056 --> 02:40:07,056
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1708
02:40:07,057 --> 02:40:09,857
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1709
02:40:09,939 --> 02:40:14,876
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1710
02:40:21,284 --> 02:40:23,784
I do renounce him.

1711
02:40:32,095 --> 02:40:34,595
And all his works?

1712
02:40:46,809 --> 02:40:49,309
I do renounce them.

1713
02:40:54,183 --> 02:40:58,142
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1714
02:41:13,536 --> 02:41:17,597
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1715
02:41:17,707 --> 02:41:19,707
I will.

1716
02:41:19,708 --> 02:41:22,008
In the name of the Father,

1717
02:41:22,009 --> 02:41:24,009
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1718
02:41:24,010 --> 02:41:26,410
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1719
02:41:26,749 --> 02:41:29,309
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1720
02:41:29,419 --> 02:41:32,445
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1721
02:42:14,564 --> 02:42:16,565
- Carlo.
- What?

1722
02:42:16,566 --> 02:42:18,800
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1723
02:42:18,801 --> 02:42:20,836
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1724
02:42:20,837 --> 02:42:23,397
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1725
02:42:23,506 --> 02:42:25,507
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1726
02:42:25,508 --> 02:42:28,375
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1727
02:42:28,478 --> 02:42:30,978
I'll only be a couple of days.

1728
02:42:33,416 --> 02:42:35,916
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1729
02:42:46,929 --> 02:42:49,429
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1730
02:42:51,267 --> 02:42:53,668
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1731
02:42:53,669 --> 02:42:56,169
I'm sure he will.

1732
02:43:02,912 --> 02:43:05,938
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1733
02:43:06,049 --> 02:43:08,250
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1734
02:43:08,251 --> 02:43:10,879
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1735
02:43:10,987 --> 02:43:13,487
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1736
02:43:26,102 --> 02:43:28,866
Tell Mike it was only business.

1737
02:43:28,971 --> 02:43:31,471
I always liked him.

1738
02:43:31,641 --> 02:43:34,141
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1739
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:43,050
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1740
02:43:44,153 --> 02:43:46,849
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1741
02:44:32,802 --> 02:44:35,302
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1742
02:44:40,209 --> 02:44:42,043
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1743
02:44:42,044 --> 02:44:44,544
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1744
02:44:46,149 --> 02:44:49,209
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1745
02:44:49,318 --> 02:44:51,319
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1746
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:54,483
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1747
02:44:54,590 --> 02:44:57,090
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1748
02:45:00,229 --> 02:45:02,729
Don't do this to me, please.

1749
02:45:11,607 --> 02:45:14,107
Barzini's dead.

1750
02:45:15,278 --> 02:45:17,778
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1751
02:45:18,981 --> 02:45:21,481
Moe Greene...

1752
02:45:21,484 --> 02:45:23,984
Stracci...

1753
02:45:24,554 --> 02:45:27,054
Cuneo.

1754
02:45:27,123 --> 02:45:30,615
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1755
02:45:32,495 --> 02:45:34,995
Admit what you did.

1756
02:45:38,134 --> 02:45:40,634
Get him a drink.

1757
02:45:46,275 --> 02:45:48,710
Come on.

1758
02:45:48,711 --> 02:45:51,112
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1759
02:45:51,113 --> 02:45:53,613
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1760
02:45:55,251 --> 02:45:57,751
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1761
02:46:04,894 --> 02:46:06,228
Go ahead, drink.

1762
02:46:06,229 --> 02:46:08,729
Drink.

1763
02:46:11,801 --> 02:46:13,969
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1764
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:17,633
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1765
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:20,240
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1766
02:46:26,482 --> 02:46:29,883
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1767
02:46:29,986 --> 02:46:32,486
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1768
02:46:34,056 --> 02:46:37,025
because it insults my intelligence.

1769
02:46:37,126 --> 02:46:39,626
It makes me very angry.

1770
02:46:42,531 --> 02:46:45,762
Now, who approached you?

1771
02:46:45,868 --> 02:46:48,368
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1772
02:46:55,511 --> 02:46:58,011
It was Barzini.

1773
02:47:00,449 --> 02:47:02,949
Good.

1774
02:47:09,592 --> 02:47:12,254
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1775
02:47:13,696 --> 02:47:16,196
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1776
02:47:21,804 --> 02:47:24,304
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1777
02:47:49,765 --> 02:47:52,265
Hello, Carlo.

1778
02:48:48,791 --> 02:48:51,589
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1779
02:48:51,694 --> 02:48:54,492
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1780
02:49:02,907 --> 02:49:04,907
Michael! Michael!

1781
02:49:05,408 --> 02:49:07,908
Where is he?

1782
02:49:09,812 --> 02:49:14,840
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1783
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:17,544
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1784
02:49:17,653 --> 02:49:19,187
and then you killed him!

1785
02:49:19,188 --> 02:49:22,316
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1786
02:49:22,425 --> 02:49:26,054
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1787
02:49:26,162 --> 02:49:28,662
Now what am I gonna do?

1788
02:49:32,368 --> 02:49:34,868
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1789
02:49:34,937 --> 02:49:37,497
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1790
02:49:37,606 --> 02:49:40,700
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1791
02:49:40,810 --> 02:49:43,144
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1792
02:49:43,145 --> 02:49:45,645
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1793
02:49:45,681 --> 02:49:47,449
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1794
02:49:47,450 --> 02:49:49,950
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1795
02:50:03,532 --> 02:50:06,032
Take her upstairs.

1796
02:50:06,068 --> 02:50:08,568
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1797
02:50:28,624 --> 02:50:31,124
She's hysterical.

1798
02:50:35,064 --> 02:50:37,564
Hysterical.

1799
02:50:38,567 --> 02:50:41,067
Michael, is it true?

1800
02:50:42,505 --> 02:50:44,572
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1801
02:50:44,573 --> 02:50:48,065
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1802
02:50:48,177 --> 02:50:50,677
- No.
- Enough!

1803
02:51:09,064 --> 02:51:11,564
All right.

1804
02:51:13,369 --> 02:51:15,869
This one time.

1805
02:51:19,074 --> 02:51:21,574
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1806
02:51:28,117 --> 02:51:30,617
Is it true?

1807
02:51:34,223 --> 02:51:36,723
Is it?

1808
02:51:37,024 --> 02:51:38,524
No.

1809
02:51:52,241 --> 02:51:54,642
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1810
02:51:54,643 --> 02:51:57,143
Come on.

1811
02:52:26,709 --> 02:52:29,209
Don Corleone.
