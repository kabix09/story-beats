1
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,361
Hey, can I get another drink
down here?

2
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,521
WILLIE:
I've been to prison once.

3
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,121
I've been married twice.

4
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,461
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live

5
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:01,631
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.

6
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:05,301
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,

7
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:08,931
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.

8
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,841
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.

9
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:16,251
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.

10
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,811
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats

11
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,851
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,

12
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,551
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

13
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,551
Come to think of it,
I still might.

14
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:35,531
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.

15
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,761
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad

16
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,741
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present

17
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,471
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,141
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.

19
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,981
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.

20
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:54,111
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.

21
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,781
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.

22
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,851
Funny how things work out.

23
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:01,221
It's fucking hilarious.

24
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:24,651
There's Santa Claus.
Look there.

25
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,421
Wow.

26
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,791
Oh, my.
What a darling photo.

27
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,761
Are you certain you only want
the single?

28
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:43,031
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa

29
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,471
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.

30
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,561
Gee.
You know what?

31
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,611
This one, I think it's more
than enough.

32
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,511
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

33
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,051
So, what do you want,
little girl?

34
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,911
A drum set.

35
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,851
Oh, the old man will love that.

36
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,151
Okay. Fine.
See you later.

37
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,421
I saw you at another mall.

38
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,291
Well, I'm very happy for you.

39
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,201
You're not really Santa.

40
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,571
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.

41
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,661
You want to see some magic?

42
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,071
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.

43
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,211
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.

44
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,271
- What do you want?
- A new bike.

45
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,321
Wow. That's a new one.
Excellent.

46
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,681
MAN:
Attention, shoppers.

47
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,481
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

48
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,281
We hope tomorrow is
a pleasant Christmas.

49
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:35,621
Thank you for shopping with us.

50
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,251
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's the last one.

51
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,551
Thank the fuck Christ.

52
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,201
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

53
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:45,461
You pissed yourself.

54
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,831
Aw, Jesus.

55
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:55,431
Yeah, all right.

56
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,071
Yeah.

57
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,371
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.

58
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,011
Merry Christmas.

59
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,111
Happy holidays.

60
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,381
Get home safe.

61
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:08,081
Yeah, okay.

62
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,451
I don't care what he says.

63
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,681
- We're going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?

64
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,821
I'll get right back to you.

65
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,331
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm trying to fucking leave.

66
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,731
Pants are awful baggy.

67
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,771
You got anything in there?

68
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,561
Yeah. My dick.
You want to see it?

69
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,971
Keep pushing me.

70
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,901
I got my eyes on you.

71
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,701
All the time.

72
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,571
Ready.

73
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:39,741
Jesus.

74
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,751
- How's it going?
- I'm finished when I'm finished.

75
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,081
I'm going back upstairs.

76
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,991
I need a melon baller
and a loofah.

77
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,621
Got it.

78
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,921
Fuck the loofah.
Let's go.

79
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,771
Marcus, you get the loofah?

80
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,401
Drive.

81
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:48,811
Oh!

82
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,891
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Put me down.

83
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:01,951
Hey, put me down.

84
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,791
Come on!
Put me down.

85
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,831
Oh, come on.

86
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,931
Oh, man.

87
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,131
Hey, baby, two more of these,
all right?

88
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,301
No.
That's it for me.

89
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,471
You can't drink worth a shit,
you know that?

90
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:27,181
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.

91
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:31,121
Come on. One more.
It's a celebration.

92
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,331
Here's to you.

93
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:45,001
You're getting worse,
you know that?

94
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,161
Well, at least I got it open.

95
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,171
It took you long enough.

96
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,911
I remember when you could unlock
a lock like it was nothing.

97
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,071
Yeah, well, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

98
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,211
I'm out.

99
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,011
Bullshit.

100
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,421
Bullshit, my ass.

101
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:08,361
We just made $111,000
in one night.

102
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,091
Exactly. I figure I got enough
to go to Miami.

103
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,601
And do what?

104
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,191
I don't know. Shit.
Get a car.

105
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,831
Get a place, maybe.

106
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:20,201
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.

107
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:22,001
Something like that.

108
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:26,841
I could quit drinking
and run the place.

109
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:29,111
Maybe marry a waitress.

110
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,251
What?

111
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,121
You ain't gonna do shit
except go down there

112
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,991
and drink your fucking ass off.

113
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,791
You're gonna piss
everything away

114
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,921
and end up counting the days
till next Christmas.

115
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,561
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

116
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,151
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

117
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,931
If I call you next December...

118
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,161
if I call you next December...

119
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,211
you're gonna be so happy
to hear from me

120
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,501
you're gonna do
a goddamn backflip.

121
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:57,841
You're gonna put
that Santa hat on so fast

122
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:00,311
that you're gonna get
fucking hat-burn.

123
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:03,211
Can I get you guys two more?

124
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,181
No, thanks.
We're all right.

125
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:14,621
See?

126
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,061
I'm already on the wagon.

127
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:50,661
Hey. Asshole!

128
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,291
How many times
I got to tell you?

129
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,201
Get out from behind my bar!

130
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,431
Put the drink down right now.

131
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,801
Put the drink down right now!

132
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,531
Ahh.
Fuck you.

133
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,041
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.

134
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,631
WOMAN:
Oh. Hey!

135
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,701
Ow!

136
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,211
Get the fuck out of my bar.

137
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,311
Fuck you!

138
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,411
You're fucking crazy.

139
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,221
Fucking prick.

140
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,151
Asshole!

141
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,591
Get the fuck out of here
right now!

142
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,071
Fucking shit!

143
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,871
Fuck you!

144
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,671
Fuck you!

145
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,471
Fuck you!

146
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,351
Yeah, baby.

147
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:12,991
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play
"Hide the Nazi" one day?

148
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,961
God damn it.

149
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,471
Here you go, sweetie.

150
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,871
I got something
for your pretty ass.

151
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:32,071
- You do?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:37,281
Wow. $5.

153
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:38,341
Thanks.

154
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,791
I gotta listen to my messages,
and you need to take a shower.

155
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:49,721
I'm a dancer.
I sweat.

156
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,391
Yeah, well, you smell like
a bum's nut sac.

157
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,491
Fuck you.

158
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:02,001
Message one.

159
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,441
MAN:
Mr. Soke?

160
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:07,541
This is Andrew Kaplan again,
from the collection agency.

161
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,081
Message two.

162
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:12,141
WOMAN:
This is Dolores Axelrod.

163
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,241
You ran into my car last week.

164
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,721
I called State Farm,

165
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,191
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.

166
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,891
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...

167
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,861
Message three.

168
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:27,261
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.

169
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,501
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.

170
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:07,931
Jesus Christ!

171
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:11,311
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?

172
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,911
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...

173
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:22,921
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.

174
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:24,681
Five Christmases I've been here.

175
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,851
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts

176
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,451
and who happens to work
with a real midget.

177
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,721
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.

178
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,131
Santa's the attraction.

179
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,671
I do Burl Ives songs.

180
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:36,501
Does this schmo
even play guitar?

181
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:40,031
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.

182
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,871
Believe me, if it was, I...

183
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,641
I don't think they like
"midget. "

184
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,471
I think you're supposed to
call them...

185
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,981
Oh, just forget it.

186
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,011
Hacks!

187
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:52,411
Hi.

188
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,881
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.

189
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,941
Great photo and resume,
by the way.

190
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:57,781
Thanks.

191
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,951
We've been at this
a long time and all.

192
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,791
We'd like to think we do
a good job.

193
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,451
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.

194
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,091
I must say,
your look is just sensational.

195
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:07,831
MARCUS:
Thanks.

196
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:10,731
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.

197
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,671
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.

198
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,071
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.

199
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,111
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?

200
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,081
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...

201
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,341
Performance, like sexual?

202
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,681
- Excuse me?
- Willie.

203
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:29,081
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?

204
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,451
Is that what you're saying?

205
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:31,991
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.

206
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,851
My fuck stick.

207
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:37,391
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.

208
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:38,931
You know how
your blood sugar is.

209
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,461
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?

210
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,471
No, no, no.
It's a joke.

211
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,871
An adult joke for us adults.

212
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,701
It's a joke.
Just a joke.

213
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:57,381
"Fuck stick"?

214
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:00,381
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.

215
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,941
So, as our security chief,

216
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:05,151
I wanted you to be aware.

217
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,491
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it

218
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,551
in front of the children,
which is fine.

219
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:13,091
Because, you know,
there is an adult world

220
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,631
and a child's world,
and that's okay.

221
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,461
I'm no censor.

222
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,301
"Little friend"?

223
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:21,311
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.

224
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:24,001
Or midget.

225
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,441
I don't know
what he's called exactly.

226
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:29,911
But, uh, he's a little guy.

227
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:32,851
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.

228
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,041
But thin fingers.

229
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:38,611
Not the fat sausage fingers.

230
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,591
"Little people. "
That's what they like.

231
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:46,151
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.

232
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,221
So "fuck stick. "
That's it?

233
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,031
Yeah.

234
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,841
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

235
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:02,071
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

236
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:04,641
Merry Christmas!

237
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:12,091
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?

238
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,631
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.

239
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:22,461
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.

240
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:28,871
God damn it!

241
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,971
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.

242
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,671
So stop acting
like you know something.

243
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,441
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!

244
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:37,411
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.

245
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,611
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.

246
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:47,951
WILLIE:
What do you want?

247
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,551
What?

248
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,191
Get out of here.

249
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:52,991
Next.

250
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,661
Next.

251
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:58,171
Oh, good.
What do you want?

252
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,441
What do you want?
What are you doing?

253
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,631
God damn it!

254
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,871
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

255
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,911
I don't give a shit
what you want.

256
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,641
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.

257
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:13,741
Next.
Come on.

258
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,251
What do you want?

259
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,591
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.

260
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:20,851
Come on.
What do you want?

261
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,091
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.

262
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:24,361
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.

263
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:25,691
Oh, thank you.

264
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:28,731
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.

265
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,101
Next.

266
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:33,141
Next!

267
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,671
What do you want?

268
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:39,271
Fraggle-Stick car.

269
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,341
What the fuck is that?

270
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,971
Fraggle-Stick car.

271
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,021
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.

272
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,891
Hey, check out this loser.

273
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,831
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?

274
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,501
Hey, loser.

275
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,411
Hey, dipshit.

276
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,031
Moron.

277
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,981
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?

278
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,111
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?

279
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,721
You know what?
Fuck this.

280
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,991
You're next.

281
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,051
WILLIE:
Next.

282
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,501
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?

283
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,261
Move it along.

284
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,711
What's your name?
You can tell me.

285
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:47,071
I know.
How about Santa?

286
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,711
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.

287
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:51,841
That's right.

288
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,891
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.

289
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,511
What do you want?

290
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,351
Well, come on.
What do you want?

291
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,291
A snot-rag?

292
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:10,461
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.

293
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,871
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.

294
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:15,601
Don't fuck with my beard.

295
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,141
It's not real.

296
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:18,701
No shit.

297
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,011
Well, it was real.

298
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,411
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.

299
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:25,421
How did you get sick?

300
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,951
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.

301
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:29,111
Mrs. Santa?

302
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:30,421
No.
It was her sister.

303
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,621
What's it like
at the North Pole?

304
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,061
Like the suburbs.

305
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:35,621
Which one?

306
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:37,831
Apache Junction.

307
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:40,661
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.

308
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:42,721
You sit there
like a fucking retard.

309
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,771
You are really Santa, right?

310
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,171
No.
I'm an accountant.

311
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:49,701
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?

312
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,501
Okay.

313
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:54,101
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.

314
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:03,221
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.

315
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,981
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.

316
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,531
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?

317
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:10,581
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.

318
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,061
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!

319
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,531
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.

320
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,691
You saying something to me?

321
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:20,101
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.

322
00:24:58,381 --> 00:24:59,811
What?

323
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:08,421
Mmm.

324
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,551
Another Grand-Dad, Santa?

325
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:12,561
Yeah.

326
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:13,721
Yeah?

327
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:21,461
Got a name?

328
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,161
Yeah.

329
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,771
So, what do you do, you know...

330
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,271
After the holidays, I mean.

331
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,281
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.

332
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,281
Oh. Another?

333
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:41,791
Yeah. Why not?

334
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:46,921
Merry Christmas.

335
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,061
Not a big talker.

336
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,691
No, not really.

337
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,101
- Buy you one?
- Why not?

338
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,541
Happy New Year.

339
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,171
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.

340
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,911
It's not that big
a fucking deal.

341
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,181
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?

342
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:20,621
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.

343
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,691
Prove it.

344
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:27,931
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

345
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,131
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

346
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:32,761
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!

347
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,201
Can't I at least take
this hat off?

348
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:35,971
No. I love the hat.

349
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,841
Okay.

350
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:41,071
Whoo!

351
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:49,421
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.

352
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,111
In case you didn't notice.

353
00:26:51,191 --> 00:26:54,181
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.

354
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:56,191
So is my thing for tits.

355
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,531
Yeah.
It is like that, though.

356
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,791
From when you're a kid.

357
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,201
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.

358
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:06,761
So it was like
this forbidden thing.

359
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,501
So...

360
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:15,511
I like you.

361
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,911
Don't mothball that suit.

362
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:27,591
What the fuck?

363
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,651
I am not gay.

364
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,651
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?

365
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,631
I said I am not gay.

366
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:37,831
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?

367
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,371
Yes.

368
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:42,101
But that isn't
what this is about.

369
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,871
You're as queer as a $10 bill.

370
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:46,271
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

371
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:50,041
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.

372
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:53,311
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.

373
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:56,011
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...

374
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,051
Elf fucker!

375
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,221
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.

376
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,761
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?

377
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,561
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!

378
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:04,891
Leave Santa alone!

379
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,261
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.

380
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:10,101
Leave Santa alone!

381
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,571
Ass clown.

382
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:25,621
Hey, you're that kid.

383
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:29,411
What the fuck are you
doing here?

384
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:44,801
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?

385
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:45,861
Uh-huh.

386
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,371
I'm not your fucking dada.

387
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:49,131
Uh-huh.

388
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:53,741
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.

389
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:55,471
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.

390
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:58,141
You're right there
to grab his balls.

391
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:00,411
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?

392
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,551
- What?
- This car.

393
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:04,551
Which turn is it?

394
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:06,721
Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?

395
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,951
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.

396
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:11,461
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.

397
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:12,791
Is it left or right?

398
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:13,891
That way.

399
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,591
Where's the stable?

400
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,831
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?

401
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,001
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.

402
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,541
But the noise.
How do they sleep?

403
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,601
- What noise?
- From the shop.

404
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,141
They only work during the day,
all right?

405
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:28,981
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.

406
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:30,981
Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.

407
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,241
Then how do they sleep?

408
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:34,621
Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.

409
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:38,141
What is it with you? Somebody
drop you on your fucking head?

410
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:39,621
On my head?

411
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,961
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?

412
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,691
How can they drop me
onto my own head?

413
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:46,531
No, not onto your...
Would...

414
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,661
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?

415
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,641
Okay.
Which house is it?

416
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,971
That one.

417
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,911
With Jesus and his family
there or what?

418
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,541
No.
The one beside that.

419
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:02,441
- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.

420
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,001
All right.

421
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,161
Nice digs.

422
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:16,891
Is Daddy home?

423
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,931
He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.

424
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,431
He's been gone a long time.

425
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:24,231
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?

426
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:25,231
Till next year.

427
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:26,601
Yeah?
What about Mommy?

428
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:29,771
She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost

429
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:33,331
and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.

430
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,881
Well, who the fuck takes care
of you, then?

431
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:36,741
Grandma.

432
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:38,411
Yeah?
What's her name?

433
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:39,811
Grandma.

434
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:42,891
Is Granny spry?

435
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,051
Everybody!

436
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:54,861
Grandma? Grandma?

437
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,161
Santa's here.

438
00:30:57,241 --> 00:31:00,361
Oh, Roger.
You're home.

439
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,701
Are you spry?

440
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:06,041
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

441
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:16,941
Are you telling me
she's the only one here?

442
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:18,391
Nobody else?

443
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:21,551
No aunts or cousins or uncles
or anything like that?

444
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,591
A butler or security guard
or something?

445
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:25,991
Nuh-unh.

446
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,001
You're shitting me.

447
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,261
Does your daddy have a safe?

448
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,071
Need money to fix your sleigh?

449
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,081
Exactly.

450
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:48,821
You want milk and cookies?

451
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:49,951
No.

452
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,551
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

453
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:52,921
Unh-unh.

454
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:54,461
Does your daddy have a car?

455
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:01,631
Bye, Santa!

456
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,941
WILLIE:
Oh, my!

457
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,951
- WOMAN: Keep going.
- Jesus!

458
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,321
Ohh!

459
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:25,491
Oh, God!

460
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:26,491
Ooh!

461
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:29,321
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!

462
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:30,451
Keep it going.

463
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,261
Jesus Christ!

464
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:34,031
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.

465
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:36,621
You ain't gonna
shit right for a week.

466
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:37,631
Oh!

467
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,141
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

468
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:41,541
Whoo!

469
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,171
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.

470
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:50,481
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That's all.

471
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,741
That's right.
I forgot to take my pill.

472
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,221
It's not just the swearing.

473
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,811
Um...

474
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:00,821
Forgive me for prying.

475
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:04,491
But did one of you, um...

476
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,651
fornicate...

477
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:06,701
Fornicate?

478
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:10,461
Yes, with a heavyset woman
in the Big & Tall dressing room.

479
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,001
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.

480
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:18,201
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.

481
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:19,471
Yes, well, even still,

482
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,481
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...

483
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:24,211
If we what?

484
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:27,881
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.

485
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,341
Before you do something stupid,

486
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:31,981
you may want to think
about this shit.

487
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,221
What are you talking about?

488
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,891
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.

489
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,521
A colored, African-American
small person.

490
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,821
That's what I'm talking about.

491
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,991
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today. "

492
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,471
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers

493
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,661
all over the sidewalk out there.

494
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,641
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.

495
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:53,071
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.

496
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,741
Screaming and hollering
your name out.

497
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:58,011
Unfair practices.
Get me?

498
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,381
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.

499
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,721
I have nothing
against you people.

500
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,621
"You people"?

501
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:08,491
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people. "

502
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:09,861
Who the hell is "us people"?

503
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:11,191
Wait. Wait.
No, no.

504
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:13,491
I... You don't under...
What?

505
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,561
He...
No, no.

506
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:18,571
Um, you know, I think it's best

507
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,501
if we just forget we had
this conversation.

508
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,971
Okay.

509
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,311
Good thinking.

510
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:28,871
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

511
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:31,381
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.

512
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,681
You're pathetic.

513
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,731
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.

514
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,061
What's that?
Like a diamond?

515
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:54,101
It's a belly-button ring.

516
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:55,571
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.

517
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,301
Check this out.

518
00:34:57,381 --> 00:35:00,111
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?

519
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:03,781
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.

520
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,181
Come on.

521
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,511
See? Move the ball.
There you go.

522
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,821
Motherfucker!

523
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,081
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.

524
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,431
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.

525
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,831
She said she was 18.

526
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,301
But you promised no arcades.

527
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,091
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.

528
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,971
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?

529
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,701
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.

530
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,241
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.

531
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:34,171
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?

532
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,511
Mind your own goddamn business.

533
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:46,161
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?

534
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:53,421
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.

535
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,561
And I heard these...

536
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:59,731
Um, you know, these noises.

537
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:04,331
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah. "

538
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:07,741
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.

539
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:13,811
You ain't going to S-H-I-T
right for a month. "

540
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,591
But don't get me wrong.

541
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,751
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.

542
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:21,821
What a man does
with his own penis...

543
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:23,991
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...

544
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,761
it's not for
the American people to say.

545
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,561
Yeah, right.

546
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:31,161
But when you're dealing
with children...

547
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,841
They have a tender sensibility.

548
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,771
And you are in a position
of trust.

549
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:44,411
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms

550
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:47,111
with large women shouldn't...

551
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,681
Yeah.

552
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,721
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.

553
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:54,021
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.

554
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:56,651
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

555
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,091
Fucking broads.

556
00:36:58,161 --> 00:36:59,421
But I just can't help it.

557
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,961
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.

558
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,001
Well, sure.

559
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:06,761
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.

560
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:11,001
So...

561
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,641
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.

562
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:15,881
Yeah, I get you.

563
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,611
Do you?

564
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:19,551
Do you think
you could find something?

565
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,591
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.

566
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,831
Shit.

567
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,521
Hey, Opal.
Come here.

568
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:53,781
Unh-unh.

569
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:55,681
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.

570
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,621
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.

571
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,711
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.

572
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:03,761
I'm just tired of you, Willie.

573
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,821
Ooh.

574
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,131
Who the fuck is in my room?

575
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,671
Did you see somebody
go in my room?

576
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:13,861
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.

577
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:15,101
Looked like a cop.

578
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:16,761
Oh, shit.

579
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:19,201
Marcus, it's Willie.

580
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:21,371
I just got back to the motel.

581
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,781
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.

582
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,481
What guy?
You get a look at him?

583
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,181
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.

584
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,381
Think somebody's onto us?

585
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,721
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?

586
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,221
No, I just got clothes in there.

587
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,621
Just ditch, you idiot.

588
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:35,781
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?

589
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,561
- Santa!
- Yeah.

590
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:40,221
You're bringing
my present early?

591
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,631
No.

592
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:44,371
But I never told you
what I wanted.

593
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:47,271
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.

594
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:48,811
Okay. Good.

595
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,901
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.

596
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,971
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.

597
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:56,881
See which one fills up first.

598
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,381
Okay.

599
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,641
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.

600
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,741
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.

601
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:04,851
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.

602
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:07,761
And I'm out on my ass now.

603
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:09,691
She got half of everything.

604
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,751
This is gonna be cool.

605
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:13,661
This will do fine.

606
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,801
So I'm gonna be crashing here.

607
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:25,071
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?

608
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:27,301
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

609
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,011
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.

610
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,051
What about the elves?

611
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:34,081
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.

612
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:36,381
I get them on the weekends.

613
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:38,651
Why don't you go run me a bath?

614
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:43,891
What about the reindeer?

615
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,521
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?

616
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,531
What are their names?

617
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:50,591
Who?

618
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:51,731
The elves.

619
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,171
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.

620
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:55,601
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.

621
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:57,571
That's the Seven Dwarfs.

622
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,371
Oh, you're shitting me.

623
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,541
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...

624
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,881
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.

625
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:06,041
I just call them, "bub. "

626
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,181
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.

627
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:10,021
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.

628
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,061
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

629
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,891
I can't remember this shit!

630
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,981
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?

631
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,001
How old are they?

632
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,061
You want cookies?

633
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:29,961
No.

634
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,271
Warm milk?

635
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:32,241
No.

636
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,001
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

637
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,841
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.

638
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,401
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?

639
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:40,781
Okay.
Do you want anything else?

640
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,481
No.

641
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,021
Okay.

642
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,361
Santa?

643
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:02,731
What?

644
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:05,371
I brought you some orange juice.

645
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,541
What's in it?

646
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:11,211
Oranges.

647
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:15,821
Look what I have.

648
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,951
An Advent calendar.

649
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:19,151
What the hell is that?

650
00:41:19,221 --> 00:41:22,991
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.

651
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:25,091
Every day you peel open
a new box.

652
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,751
You get part of the story.

653
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,821
And then there's
a chocolate inside.

654
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,531
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?

655
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,441
No.
You go ahead.

656
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,811
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.

657
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:51,011
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee

658
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,081
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.

659
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:57,091
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree

660
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:00,191
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.

661
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:03,431
Everyone went to his hometown
to register. "

662
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:08,231
- That it?
- Yep.

663
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:10,641
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.

664
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:14,171
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.

665
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:17,811
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?

666
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:19,941
You go ahead.

667
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:25,421
Are you coming downstairs?

668
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:28,151
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.

669
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:40,831
Fuck me?
Fuck you.

670
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,901
You can't just take up
with some kid.

671
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:45,341
You don't know who's around
or what they do.

672
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:47,841
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.

673
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:50,571
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?

674
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,081
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.

675
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:55,781
Shit.

676
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:58,521
Fuck you.

677
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,601
You are by far the dumbest,

678
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,301
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit

679
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:15,811
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.

680
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:19,401
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?

681
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:22,211
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.

682
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,411
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.

683
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:28,451
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.

684
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,211
Sits in front of the TV
all the time.

685
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,691
You think she's gonna
rat me out?

686
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:34,691
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.

687
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,691
You fuck her?

688
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:39,461
Jesus Christ.

689
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:41,431
Is everything fucking sex
with you?

690
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:43,561
With me?
I fuck one person.

691
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:45,161
I ain't out there
serial fornicating,

692
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,361
trying to float my liver,
drinking myself silly

693
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:50,461
'cause I can't stand
what a piece of shit I am.

694
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,271
What are you,
Sigmund Sawed-off Fucking Freud?

695
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:54,971
Yeah, that's right.

696
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,601
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.

697
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,311
Make it about something safe

698
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,251
'cause you're
an emotional cripple.

699
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:01,881
Your soul is dog shit.

700
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:04,441
Every single fucking thing
about you is ugly.

701
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:13,721
Come on, Lois.
Let's get out of here.

702
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:27,201
Look who's here, Jimmy.
It's Santa.

703
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:28,801
That's fucking great.

704
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:31,441
Let's tell him what you want
for Christmas.

705
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,581
Fuck.

706
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:40,251
I'm on my fucking
lunch break, okay?

707
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,351
Are you insane?

708
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,221
Management's gonna hear
about this.

709
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:46,731
You think that's a threat?

710
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,961
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.

711
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,801
Be my fucking guest.
Take a shot.

712
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:24,631
Just looking.

713
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:26,431
Aah!

714
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:34,701
Find everything
you're looking for?

715
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,011
Um, yeah.
Thank you.

716
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:39,951
Nothing I can help
you with, huh?

717
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:43,951
No. I'm just looking at
the games 'cause I have an Xbox.

718
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:46,851
Get your hands
out of my pants, man!

719
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:50,291
You're stealing from the store,
you're stealing from me.

720
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:51,691
What is this?

721
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:53,701
I was gonna pay for it.

722
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:54,821
Wrong answer.

723
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:56,801
When I look at you,
you know what I think?

724
00:45:56,871 --> 00:45:59,671
I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.

725
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:02,261
And you're part
of this sorry-ass generation.

726
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:03,931
What you want to be
when you grow up?

727
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,311
I don't know.

728
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,541
- This MP3?
- Yeah.

729
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:09,981
Take it off.

730
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,611
But my grandmother gave...

731
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:15,121
Take it off. I don't care
who gave it to you.

732
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:17,151
Take it off.

733
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:19,121
I don't care if it choke you
to death.

734
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:21,281
Now, I want you to get on
out of here. Get!

735
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,991
- But can I have...
- Get!

736
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:24,221
Happy Kwanzaa.

737
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:29,731
And pull your damn pants up!

738
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,671
What's wrong with you kids
these days?

739
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:34,201
MAN: Gin?

740
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,001
- Yeah.
- What do you need?

741
00:46:36,071 --> 00:46:37,801
I need you to run a plate
for me.

742
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,001
It's Arizona plates.

743
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:40,871
Hold on.
Let me get a pen.

744
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:09,241
Is that it?

745
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:23,991
For Christ's sake, make a move
and stick with it, would you?

746
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:33,761
King me.

747
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:38,031
Son of a bitch!

748
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:42,731
You lousy, cheating little shit!

749
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:47,141
You're fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.

750
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,771
You play like the dead lice
are falling off of you,

751
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:52,681
and then suddenly, you're like
Seabiscuit all over the place.

752
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:55,241
You're a smart-ass,
is what you are, kid.

753
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,051
Want to play again?

754
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:04,351
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.

755
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,791
I live two streets over
on Burning Trail Road.

756
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,591
I don't think we've met.

757
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,701
I'm Uncle Willie.

758
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:15,531
I'm organizing the decorations
for the subdivision this year.

759
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,041
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.

760
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:20,511
I mean yeah, I mind.

761
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:21,771
Okay. Uh...

762
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:25,801
Will you be participating in our
luminarias program this year?

763
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:30,681
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They're luminarias.

764
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:33,191
Small sacks filled with
about a pound of sand each.

765
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:35,231
We insert a candle
in the middle, light it,

766
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,621
and the bag glows.

767
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:38,351
Then we line
all the sidewalks here

768
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:40,791
all around the neighborhood.

769
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:45,331
You see, we don't celebrate
Christmas around here, so...

770
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,631
We're, uh, we're Muslims.

771
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:50,761
Look, it's my first year
running this.

772
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:53,141
I'd like it if there weren't
any gaps in it.

773
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:55,941
What if I come by
Christmas Eve and do it for you?

774
00:48:56,011 --> 00:48:58,111
No, you know what?
You don't have to do that.

775
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:00,781
Yeah, me and the kid here,
we'll do something.

776
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,111
Great.
I got the supplies.

777
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:03,651
- I'll throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.

778
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:05,621
Awesome.

779
00:49:05,691 --> 00:49:07,381
Going in the garage,
just so you know.

780
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:11,091
MAN ON TV: You can make
a delicious six-pound chicken.

781
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:14,291
Enough hot dogs and sausages
to feed a small army.

782
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:17,601
Not one, but two delicious
rotisserie chickens.

783
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:20,141
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

784
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:23,071
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

785
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:26,131
MAN ON TV: Scrumptious
6 1/2-pound standing rib roast.

786
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:30,871
And everybody's favorite,
baby back ribs.

787
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:47,361
This is such a nice house.

788
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,961
Needs a woman's touch, though.

789
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:53,031
I just rent
the fucking place anyway.

790
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:57,461
Yeah.
I just rent stuff, too.

791
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,701
Yeah?

792
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:08,311
How long are you gonna be here?

793
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:10,441
What? On the couch?

794
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,151
No.

795
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,951
In town.

796
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:18,191
I don't know.
Just through the holidays.

797
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:20,561
You know, then I'll move on.

798
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,401
So, do you like kids?

799
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,401
Fuck, no!

800
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,941
Do you think
I'm some kind of pervert?

801
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:32,911
I just mean because
you're Santa Claus.

802
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:34,911
Oh.

803
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:37,241
I like kids.
I really like kids.

804
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:39,481
- You do?
- I love kids.

805
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:41,211
Well, good.

806
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:45,551
Yeah, they're something else,
those kids.

807
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:49,591
And to tell you the truth...

808
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:55,291
The fact of the matter is,
I'm not Santa.

809
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:00,561
Like ya anyway.

810
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:17,351
So, you'll call me, right?

811
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:20,191
Yeah.
I'll call you.

812
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:21,591
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.

813
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,091
Some of those
really good expensive ones.

814
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:25,421
Shut up.

815
00:51:27,701 --> 00:51:29,631
Bye.

816
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:38,691
Roger, you're home.

817
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:41,471
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

818
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:44,731
What the fuck?

819
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:48,211
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

820
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:54,651
Jesus Christ!

821
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:56,191
Let me see it!
Let me see it!

822
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:57,551
What the hell happened to you?!

823
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:00,851
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!

824
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,481
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!

825
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,551
Here, hold still.
Hold still.

826
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,291
I was just trying to help you!

827
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:12,231
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit. "

828
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:14,791
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?

829
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:16,571
God damn it.

830
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,951
Hey, kid?

831
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:27,681
Kid, you okay up there?

832
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:30,281
You need a Band-Aid
or something?

833
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:41,621
Aw, shit.

834
00:53:50,441 --> 00:53:51,631
You're late.

835
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,211
Kids.
Let me tell you.

836
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:05,551
They run you ragged.

837
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:19,431
Morning, team.

838
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:21,061
Hey, hey, hey.

839
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:23,401
It's not quite 8:00 yet.

840
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,431
Well, how close are we?

841
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,281
Now it's 8:00.

842
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:33,441
Merry Christmas.

843
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,481
Up your ass.

844
00:54:41,831 --> 00:54:43,191
God damn it!

845
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,821
You tear your ball again?

846
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:46,161
I don't think so.

847
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:48,821
That's it.

848
00:55:05,351 --> 00:55:07,481
God damn it!

849
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:24,561
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.

850
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:26,301
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.

851
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:29,841
Yeah.

852
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,901
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.

853
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:33,941
All right.
Now you're talking.

854
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:36,041
Oh, hold on one minute.

855
00:55:36,111 --> 00:55:38,511
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.

856
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:39,641
That's not the stuff.

857
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:42,011
Use something
with some gloss to it.

858
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:44,491
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.

859
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:47,821
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.

860
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:49,221
Okay.

861
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,221
Yeah, I'm back.

862
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,731
The guy's Roger Merman.

863
00:55:51,801 --> 00:55:54,031
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.

864
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,191
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?

865
00:56:06,611 --> 00:56:08,201
Who are you?

866
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,511
Your name Roger Merman?

867
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:10,571
Yes. But...

868
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:12,381
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?

869
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:17,051
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.

870
00:56:17,121 --> 00:56:19,551
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?

871
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:21,591
Is it Grandma?

872
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:22,851
Is my son all right?

873
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:24,261
They're fine.

874
00:56:24,331 --> 00:56:26,631
Do you have any houseguests?

875
00:56:27,331 --> 00:56:28,461
Houseguests?

876
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:32,861
Thank you for your time.
God bless.

877
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:35,601
Well, hey, who are you?

878
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:40,071
Houseguests?

879
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,711
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.

880
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:48,551
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.

881
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:50,521
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.

882
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:52,521
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.

883
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:54,151
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread

884
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:56,061
with a bunch of junk on it.

885
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58,821
It's like a tostada.

886
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,491
This isn't a tostada.

887
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:02,901
There you go, Granny.

888
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:06,231
Little salsa here.

889
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:09,701
Now it's a tostada.

890
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:12,071
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?

891
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:14,541
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?

892
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,771
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?

893
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,841
The story sucks anyway.

894
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:24,481
I think I saw it in the hallway.

895
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:26,281
- Really?
- I think so.

896
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:37,831
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.

897
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:40,461
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

898
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:44,071
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.

899
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:01,491
There's a candy corn
in this one.

900
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,191
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?

901
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:12,101
Well, it's fucked.

902
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,571
Yeah?

903
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:15,261
Yeah.

904
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:17,031
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...

905
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:18,701
- Clean...
- Oh.

906
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:20,471
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?

907
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:21,841
- No.
- Oh.

908
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:23,851
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.

909
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:25,181
- He curses.
- Yeah?

910
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,051
- But never around children.
- Oh.

911
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:28,551
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.

912
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:31,211
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.

913
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,381
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.

914
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:34,751
Sex, yeah.

915
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:37,491
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.

916
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,361
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.

917
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:41,491
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.

918
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,261
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

919
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:49,731
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.

920
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:52,571
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.

921
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:54,411
Yeah.

922
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:56,141
Fucks large women.

923
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:58,671
What can I say?

924
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:14,191
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.

925
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,011
Wedgie.

926
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:27,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

927
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:31,581
Well, what the hell do you want?

928
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,051
Pokémon!

929
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:34,481
Done.

930
00:59:38,861 --> 00:59:42,091
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.

931
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,161
Santa...

932
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,531
Oh, jeez.

933
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:54,271
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.

934
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,131
Where the hell's the rest of it?

935
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,671
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?

936
00:59:58,741 --> 01:00:02,301
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.

937
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,071
But now I changed my mind.

938
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:07,081
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.

939
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:08,711
I want a gorilla named Davey

940
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,651
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.

941
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:14,091
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,

942
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:16,591
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

943
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,431
Jesus, kid.

944
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:24,761
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,

945
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,801
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.

946
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,271
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.

947
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:31,201
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?

948
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:34,041
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?

949
01:00:34,111 --> 01:00:37,011
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?

950
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,671
What the fuck?

951
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:39,611
No.

952
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,341
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?

953
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:46,581
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

954
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:48,321
When he wasn't busting my ass,

955
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,221
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.

956
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,621
The world ain't fair.

957
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,091
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.

958
01:00:54,161 --> 01:00:56,861
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.

959
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,601
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.

960
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,801
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.

961
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:05,361
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.

962
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:07,971
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.

963
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:24,891
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?

964
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:27,991
All right, next.

965
01:01:29,831 --> 01:01:32,161
Open the ropes there, Marcus.

966
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:34,401
I know you?

967
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:35,491
Not yet.

968
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:39,971
Seven cities in seven years.

969
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,701
Pretty impressive.

970
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,081
The store changes,
your name changes.

971
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:46,621
But you always get away clean.

972
01:01:46,681 --> 01:01:47,951
Yeah.

973
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:49,921
Pretty darn impressive.

974
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:51,581
Well, let's face the facts.

975
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:53,881
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.

976
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:57,191
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,

977
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:58,781
and I respect that.

978
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:00,891
But you also been caught...

979
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:03,121
... by me.

980
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:06,031
So this is how it's gonna be.

981
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,731
I don't want to take over.

982
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:10,071
I don't even want to change
your scam.

983
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:12,231
Whatever you guys do, it works.

984
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,211
All I want is a taste.

985
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:16,801
When the deed is done,
we part ways.

986
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:18,711
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,

987
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:22,151
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.

988
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,081
- How much?
- Half.

989
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:28,451
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.

990
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:31,691
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!

991
01:02:33,101 --> 01:02:34,961
Okay. 30%.

992
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:37,831
There's three of us.
30%. That's fair.

993
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,601
Half.

994
01:02:39,671 --> 01:02:40,971
I meant 33%...

995
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:41,901
I meant half.

996
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:43,001
... and 1/3.

997
01:02:43,071 --> 01:02:44,561
Half.

998
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:47,071
35%.

999
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:48,741
Half.

1000
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,471
40%.

1001
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,081
Half.

1002
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:56,481
42%.

1003
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,021
Half.

1004
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:06,151
45%.

1005
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,791
Half.

1006
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:15,891
48%?

1007
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:19,131
Half.

1008
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:20,901
49%.

1009
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:22,411
Half.

1010
01:03:24,081 --> 01:03:25,951
Well, what's one point?

1011
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:27,951
We split the dough
right down the middle.

1012
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,491
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.

1013
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,891
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...

1014
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:35,391
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.

1015
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:38,021
I tell you how it's gonna be.

1016
01:03:38,091 --> 01:03:40,461
This is pricks fix.

1017
01:03:45,941 --> 01:03:46,991
Pricks fix?

1018
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,001
He's a fucking moron.

1019
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:49,971
Oh, really?

1020
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,841
Is that how you got
the upper hand?

1021
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:52,811
Fuck you.

1022
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:53,861
Negotiating?

1023
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:55,811
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.

1024
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,641
I can always get
another box jockey.

1025
01:03:57,711 --> 01:03:59,081
I can get another midget, too.

1026
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:00,381
Yeah, where?

1027
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,481
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?

1028
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:05,991
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.

1029
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:08,391
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.

1030
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:11,791
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.

1031
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:13,491
You're too pathetic for words.

1032
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,331
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.

1033
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:42,721
Santa'll be here real soon,
kids. Real soon.

1034
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:47,991
There he is.
Look.

1035
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,961
Oh, no.

1036
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:01,581
Oh, my God!

1037
01:05:30,271 --> 01:05:32,261
Sweet Jews for Jesus.

1038
01:05:32,341 --> 01:05:34,371
I pissed myself.

1039
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,141
What the fuck
do you think you doing?

1040
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:38,041
You son of a bitch!

1041
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:39,271
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

1042
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:40,711
Hey, come on, come on.

1043
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:42,411
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!

1044
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:44,421
Look here.
Get him out of here.

1045
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,111
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.

1046
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:48,951
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?

1047
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:50,361
Take him to the car.

1048
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,421
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.

1049
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:55,491
So unless you got
a forklift handy,

1050
01:05:55,571 --> 01:05:57,501
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?

1051
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:59,631
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.

1052
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:01,571
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.

1053
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:02,541
You all the same.

1054
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:03,701
Special treatment?

1055
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:06,111
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!

1056
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:07,771
It's a matter of physics.

1057
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:10,311
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?

1058
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,141
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1059
01:06:12,211 --> 01:06:13,841
Sketch it up, you moron.

1060
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:16,481
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

1061
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:19,221
What you call me, thigh high?

1062
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,951
I called you
a fucking guinea homo

1063
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,361
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!

1064
01:06:23,431 --> 01:06:25,521
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.

1065
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:28,261
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?

1066
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:30,161
You got some lip on you, midget.

1067
01:06:30,231 --> 01:06:33,071
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.

1068
01:06:33,141 --> 01:06:35,901
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?

1069
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:37,531
Asshole.

1070
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:43,311
I pissed my pants.

1071
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:44,711
Oh, shut up.

1072
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:11,411
Santa.

1073
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:22,711
Santa?

1074
01:07:24,091 --> 01:07:25,491
What?

1075
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:28,591
What are you doing?

1076
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:31,431
Nothing.

1077
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:34,431
You going to work today?

1078
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:39,671
Not really.

1079
01:07:39,741 --> 01:07:42,471
You just gonna sit there?

1080
01:07:44,611 --> 01:07:45,541
Yeah.

1081
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:48,301
Just let me alone, okay?

1082
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,751
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?

1083
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:55,281
Yeah?

1084
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,191
I want you to take this letter.

1085
01:08:01,261 --> 01:08:05,391
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,

1086
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,491
there's gonna be
some cops there.

1087
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,761
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.

1088
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:12,701
What is it?

1089
01:08:12,771 --> 01:08:15,761
It just tells
all the bad things that...

1090
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:20,671
What the fuck happened
to your eye?

1091
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:23,311
Fucking little prick!

1092
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:28,911
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?

1093
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:33,551
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!

1094
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:36,221
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!

1095
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,021
Yeah, there you go.

1096
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:58,611
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.

1097
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:02,781
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?

1098
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:05,221
No. I'm not talking about that.

1099
01:09:07,321 --> 01:09:10,881
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.

1100
01:09:10,961 --> 01:09:13,221
But it was for a purpose.

1101
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:18,191
It made me feel good
about myself.

1102
01:09:19,841 --> 01:09:22,401
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.

1103
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:24,231
I don't know.

1104
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:26,641
Like I accomplished something.

1105
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:32,881
You need many years of therapy.

1106
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:37,011
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.

1107
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,351
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.

1108
01:09:40,421 --> 01:09:42,521
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage

1109
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:44,061
when it comes to violence.

1110
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:46,291
I can't box worth a shit, see.

1111
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:50,201
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.

1112
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,791
You, you're gonna feel
everything.

1113
01:09:54,071 --> 01:09:55,541
Okay.

1114
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:59,301
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.

1115
01:09:59,381 --> 01:10:00,401
This is bullshit!

1116
01:10:00,481 --> 01:10:03,811
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.

1117
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:06,401
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.

1118
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:07,541
That's why.

1119
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,381
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.

1120
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:11,151
Come on, look at the kid.

1121
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:13,851
He is pathetic.

1122
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:15,521
Yeah, he's just a little...

1123
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,751
He's a fucking retard.

1124
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:21,091
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things

1125
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:22,491
so he can defend himself, then.

1126
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,191
Unless you're scared.

1127
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:27,431
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

1128
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:28,901
Marcus is a bully, right?

1129
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:30,941
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.

1130
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:32,231
Now, what do you do?

1131
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,371
I don't know.

1132
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,701
God damn it!
You don't know?

1133
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:38,111
If somebody wants to pull your
underwear up out of your pants,

1134
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:39,371
you have to get mad.

1135
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:41,581
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.

1136
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:43,051
Scream at him.

1137
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:46,281
Jesus fucking Christ.

1138
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:48,691
Listen at him.
He's a fucking faggot.

1139
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:51,031
Loud! Scream!

1140
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:53,031
Be loud! Be mean!

1141
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:54,291
Piss him off!
Come on!

1142
01:10:54,361 --> 01:10:55,591
Aah!

1143
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:04,131
You don't
hit people in the balls,

1144
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:05,371
you asshole!

1145
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,411
Aah!

1146
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:09,811
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's just a kid.

1147
01:11:09,881 --> 01:11:11,781
- Fuck you, Willie!
- Ow!

1148
01:11:12,511 --> 01:11:14,281
God damn it.

1149
01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:16,011
I told you
I didn't want to do this!

1150
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:18,051
Making me...
Ohh!

1151
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:21,491
Oh, shit.

1152
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:27,361
Kid, maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time around me.

1153
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:30,891
You sneaky little prick.

1154
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,571
Fuck you!
Little bastard!

1155
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:35,971
Get off me!

1156
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:46,481
Shut up. That's not even
what you said.

1157
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:48,311
Oh, God damn it,
I forgot about that.

1158
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:51,011
We got a fucking nursing home
around here.

1159
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:53,211
Well, we can go in another room.

1160
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,661
She does look kind of still,
doesn't she?

1161
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,121
Hey, Granny?

1162
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:09,831
Hey, Granny.

1163
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,881
Hey, there, Granny?

1164
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:19,641
Oh, Granny.

1165
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:22,881
Oh, my God.

1166
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,481
What the fuck?

1167
01:12:26,991 --> 01:12:28,181
Oh, shit.

1168
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:32,961
- Roger!
- God!

1169
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,621
- God damn it! Shit!
- You're home.

1170
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:39,291
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.

1171
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:16,061
Hello, little boy.

1172
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,701
Hello.
Santa...

1173
01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:20,501
I know that Christmas Eve
is in a couple days,

1174
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:22,131
and you have to fly around
the world

1175
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:26,381
and give presents to everyone,
and you won't be around anymore.

1176
01:13:26,451 --> 01:13:27,381
Yeah?

1177
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:29,971
So I thought I'd give you
your present now.

1178
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:37,951
What the fuck is it?

1179
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:39,891
It's a wooden pickle.

1180
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,961
- Why'd you paint it brown?
- It's not paint.

1181
01:13:44,031 --> 01:13:47,431
It's blood from when I cut
my hand making it for you.

1182
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,271
Oh.

1183
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:52,671
Well, shit, kid, I don't know.

1184
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:54,401
I...

1185
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:57,941
Thanks.

1186
01:13:58,011 --> 01:13:59,881
You're welcome.

1187
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:01,381
Good night, Santa.

1188
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:06,281
Good night, Mrs. Santa's sister.

1189
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:08,921
Good night, sweetie.

1190
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:13,331
Oh, my God.

1191
01:14:13,401 --> 01:14:14,831
That was so sweet.

1192
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:17,871
He's a really sweet kid,
isn't he?

1193
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:20,091
Yeah, I guess so.

1194
01:14:22,911 --> 01:14:24,841
Come on, baby.

1195
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:27,131
Come here.

1196
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:30,001
What?

1197
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:32,271
Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.

1198
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:38,181
Just a little tired.

1199
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:40,081
Oh.

1200
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:51,161
Santa!

1201
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:53,431
God damn it!
Whoa! Shit!

1202
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:55,731
Want to see my report card?

1203
01:14:55,801 --> 01:14:57,641
You scared the holy shit
out of me.

1204
01:14:57,711 --> 01:14:58,971
Think I did good?

1205
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,101
How would I know? I haven't seen
the fuckin' thing yet.

1206
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:08,551
Who the fuck is Thurman?

1207
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:11,281
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.

1208
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:14,521
Thurman Merman?

1209
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:16,151
Yeah.

1210
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,351
Jesus.

1211
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,191
So, you think I did good?

1212
01:15:23,901 --> 01:15:27,341
What do you care
what I think, anyway?

1213
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:29,531
Hell, I guess you did better
than I did.

1214
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:31,971
I never got any B's.

1215
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,571
I thought maybe at least
since I did good in school,

1216
01:15:34,641 --> 01:15:36,201
maybe you'd bring me a present.

1217
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,141
'Cause last year
and the year before that,

1218
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:40,341
you didn't bring me
any presents.

1219
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:45,751
Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

1220
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:52,151
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!

1221
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:55,291
Why do you talk about
yourself that way?!

1222
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,531
Let me give you some news.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?

1223
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:01,091
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?

1224
01:16:01,171 --> 01:16:03,641
As a matter of fact,
I'm living fucking proof

1225
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,941
that there's not a Santa Claus.

1226
01:16:06,681 --> 01:16:08,841
I know there's no Santa.

1227
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:11,351
I just thought maybe you'd
want to give me a present

1228
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:13,111
'cause we're friends.

1229
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,271
There he is.

1230
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:43,141
That lousy, leather-faced,
frog-eyed, motherfucker.

1231
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,511
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.

1232
01:17:17,611 --> 01:17:19,641
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

1233
01:17:19,721 --> 01:17:21,011
What is the problem now?

1234
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:22,781
I'm sorry.
The van stalled.

1235
01:17:23,991 --> 01:17:26,151
Will you give us a jump, please?

1236
01:17:26,221 --> 01:17:28,121
I'll be dipped in dog shit.

1237
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,251
Do I look like
an auto mechanic to you?

1238
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:39,501
I appreciate it.

1239
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:44,731
All right, small fry,
help yourself.

1240
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:50,441
I can't reach it.

1241
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:52,171
Jesus Christ, give me that.

1242
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,441
Thanks.

1243
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:56,821
All right, hit it.

1244
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,641
Oh, my.
What a terrible accident.

1245
01:18:30,721 --> 01:18:31,851
Mm-mm-mmm.

1246
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:33,291
- Is he dead?
- No.

1247
01:18:33,361 --> 01:18:35,721
But it looks like
you broke most of his ribs.

1248
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:40,421
I'd say maybe 50% of them,
or do you think 30%?

1249
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:42,221
I needed more
of a running start.

1250
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,561
I couldn't build up
enough speed.

1251
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:02,851
Merry Christmas Eve.

1252
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:06,421
Got you a little something.

1253
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,351
You shouldn't have.

1254
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:10,721
You should put that stuff
in the kitchen.

1255
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,791
God damn, you look good.

1256
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:23,131
Here you go.

1257
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:28,031
Little behind there, sweetie?

1258
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:30,411
We don't need any more
of this shit.

1259
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:34,511
"Christmas keeps us connected
to each other in peace.

1260
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:38,281
The angel is going to tell
everyone in the world. "

1261
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,091
Aspirin?

1262
01:21:11,151 --> 01:21:12,551
Shit!

1263
01:21:12,611 --> 01:21:14,241
Jesus.

1264
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:17,841
Santa?

1265
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:22,581
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.

1266
01:21:22,661 --> 01:21:25,291
I could make you one
before you leave.

1267
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:29,601
Listen, kid, I don't know.

1268
01:21:29,661 --> 01:21:32,761
I got shit to do and everything.

1269
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:39,831
Okay, make me some sandwiches.

1270
01:21:39,911 --> 01:21:42,041
I gotta go to the mall
and talk to somebody.

1271
01:21:42,111 --> 01:21:43,171
I'll be back.

1272
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:44,041
For dinner?

1273
01:21:44,111 --> 01:21:45,941
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah.

1274
01:21:46,011 --> 01:21:48,111
How many sandwiches do you want?

1275
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:51,211
Uh, a bunch.

1276
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,351
How much lettuce do you want?

1277
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:57,791
I don't know.
The usual amount.

1278
01:21:57,861 --> 01:21:59,951
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.

1279
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:01,361
Okay.

1280
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:20,541
Have a very merry Christmas.

1281
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:22,311
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.

1282
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:23,721
Merry Christmas.

1283
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,911
Good night.

1284
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:26,581
- Good night.
- Okay! Happy holiday!

1285
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:28,121
CHIPESKA:
Attention, shoppers.

1286
01:22:28,191 --> 01:22:30,521
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

1287
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:32,321
We wish you all
a merry Christmas,

1288
01:22:32,391 --> 01:22:35,631
a happy Hanukkah,
and a joyous Kwanzaa.

1289
01:22:51,351 --> 01:22:54,281
All right, hold it steady.

1290
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:00,861
Oh, yeah, shit, let's do it.

1291
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,221
Oh, Christ.

1292
01:23:08,361 --> 01:23:09,351
Merry Christmas.

1293
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:12,301
Good night.

1294
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,631
Merry Christmas, Willie.

1295
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:17,331
Up your ass.

1296
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:45,891
Aaaah!

1297
01:23:48,871 --> 01:23:50,271
Whoa!

1298
01:24:16,701 --> 01:24:18,131
Oh, shit.

1299
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:20,461
What?

1300
01:24:24,571 --> 01:24:25,871
What?

1301
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,031
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

1302
01:24:28,111 --> 01:24:28,801
So?

1303
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:30,111
Remember Andy Pitz?

1304
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:31,481
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.

1305
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:32,711
No, Andy Ripitski.

1306
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:34,651
Andy Pitzorella
was Andy Blue Balls.

1307
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:36,951
Since he got married,
they call him Andy Pitzorella.

1308
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:38,781
What's your fucking point?!

1309
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:40,551
They say he can get
into anything.

1310
01:24:40,621 --> 01:24:42,561
Anything.

1311
01:24:42,621 --> 01:24:44,921
They say he's been
in Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

1312
01:24:44,991 --> 01:24:46,361
And that's a good thing?

1313
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:48,091
So what the fuck
are you getting at?

1314
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:49,651
When I was
in the joint with him,

1315
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:53,391
he told me that the Kitnerboy
Redoubt can't be cracked.

1316
01:24:53,471 --> 01:24:56,301
Are you shittin' me?

1317
01:24:56,371 --> 01:24:58,861
Are you telling me
that after I propped you up,

1318
01:24:58,941 --> 01:25:01,641
held you together,
smiled for all those kids,

1319
01:25:01,711 --> 01:25:03,911
danced for all those
fucking housewives

1320
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:07,211
in a fucking lime-green,
fucking velvet elf costume,

1321
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:09,411
that you cannot
get in this fucking safe?!

1322
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:12,181
Is that what you're
telling me?! Huh?!

1323
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:16,021
No, I'm just saying
it's gonna take a minute.

1324
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:41,011
Fuck.

1325
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:52,351
Shit.

1326
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:54,121
34C.

1327
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:39,901
Fuck!

1328
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:14,601
Piece of cake.

1329
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:19,011
I gotta get one more thing.
I'll be right back.

1330
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:44,571
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?

1331
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:05,991
I'll bet the store dick
don't want this.

1332
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:08,431
Store dick don't want shit.

1333
01:28:10,931 --> 01:28:12,901
What do you mean?

1334
01:28:12,971 --> 01:28:14,831
Store dick's dead.

1335
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:17,371
Store dick don't want shit.

1336
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,541
He's dead, huh?

1337
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:25,241
I didn't even know he was sick.

1338
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:26,841
Willie...

1339
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:29,381
this has been
a long time coming.

1340
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:33,391
Every year, you're worse.
Every year, less reliable.

1341
01:28:33,451 --> 01:28:35,851
More booze.
More bullshit.

1342
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,391
More buttfucking.

1343
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:40,791
Sure, the three B's.

1344
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:43,461
You gotta be able to rely,
Willie.

1345
01:28:46,131 --> 01:28:48,631
You people are monsters.

1346
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:51,041
There's no joy in this for me.

1347
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:56,741
I'm not talking about
you taking me out.

1348
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:58,711
That part, I get.

1349
01:29:02,351 --> 01:29:04,181
But look at all that shit.

1350
01:29:06,551 --> 01:29:09,521
Do you really need
all that shit?

1351
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,321
For Christ sakes,
it's Christmas.

1352
01:29:13,391 --> 01:29:15,061
It is Christmas, Willie.

1353
01:29:15,131 --> 01:29:16,691
But this is what we do.

1354
01:29:16,761 --> 01:29:18,991
We get the shit.

1355
01:29:19,071 --> 01:29:22,201
Christmastime, we get the shit.

1356
01:29:22,271 --> 01:29:25,431
Because we are men and Lois.

1357
01:29:27,981 --> 01:29:29,601
It is Christmas, Willie.

1358
01:29:29,681 --> 01:29:31,741
And we are men and Lois.

1359
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:35,081
What you waiting for, honey?

1360
01:29:35,151 --> 01:29:38,121
Come on, plug him.

1361
01:29:42,021 --> 01:29:43,921
Goodbye, Willie.

1362
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:47,781
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!

1363
01:29:49,101 --> 01:29:51,121
And you, Santa,
drop the elephant.

1364
01:29:51,201 --> 01:29:53,101
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.

1365
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:54,861
Shit, that fucking kid.

1366
01:29:54,941 --> 01:29:57,731
All three of you are in so much
shit, it's almost unbelievable.

1367
01:29:59,171 --> 01:30:01,041
Marcus, hop on!

1368
01:30:21,261 --> 01:30:23,361
Fuck me.

1369
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:58,761
Hey, hey!

1370
01:31:19,951 --> 01:31:23,411
This is Christmas, and the kid's
getting his fucking present.

1371
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:50,011
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!

1372
01:31:50,081 --> 01:31:52,681
I said freeze!
Freeze!

1373
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:03,061
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1374
01:32:46,341 --> 01:32:48,271
"Dear kid...

1375
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:50,071
I hope that you got my present

1376
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:52,441
and that there wasn't
too much blood on it,

1377
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:54,911
although there was blood
on the present you gave me,

1378
01:32:54,981 --> 01:32:56,751
which didn't keep me
from enjoying it.

1379
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,881
So maybe the blood doesn't
matter so much, I guess. "

1380
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:05,221
"Anyway, just in case
they took it as evidence,

1381
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:07,631
I'm also sending you a T-shirt.

1382
01:33:07,701 --> 01:33:10,191
I hope it's the right size. "

1383
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:12,231
"I'm healing up good,

1384
01:33:12,301 --> 01:33:15,061
and they tell me
that I will soon be 100%,

1385
01:33:15,141 --> 01:33:17,001
even with 8 bullets
dug out of me,

1386
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:19,101
because they didn't hit
any vital organs,

1387
01:33:19,171 --> 01:33:21,841
just my liver,
which is fucked anyway.

1388
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:23,571
Ha ha ha.

1389
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:25,841
Thank you for giving
that letter to the cops.

1390
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:28,681
I forgot I asked you to do it,
but it's a good thing you did

1391
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:31,181
or Santa's little helper
would've plugged his ass.

1392
01:33:31,251 --> 01:33:32,551
Now the cops know I wrote it,

1393
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:34,591
which is gonna keep my ass
out of jail.

1394
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:36,151
That, plus everyone agreeing

1395
01:33:36,221 --> 01:33:38,751
that the Phoenix police
shooting an unarmed Santa

1396
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:41,391
was even more fucked up
than Rodney King. "

1397
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:44,691
"The cops are treating me
like fucking royalty now,

1398
01:33:44,771 --> 01:33:46,321
which is new in my experience.

1399
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:48,391
They're gonna make me
a sensitivity counselor

1400
01:33:48,471 --> 01:33:49,831
so that tragedies like this

1401
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:52,771
will never again embarrass
the whole fucking department.

1402
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,871
I told the cops you had no one
to take the fuck care of you,

1403
01:33:55,941 --> 01:33:58,141
so they set it up
with Mrs. Santa's sister

1404
01:33:58,211 --> 01:33:59,701
watching you
till your dad gets back

1405
01:33:59,781 --> 01:34:01,211
in one year and three months.

1406
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:04,221
They made her a guardian
pro tem or some such shit.

1407
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:07,521
Anyway, she seems to like you
and your house and Jacuzzi.

1408
01:34:07,591 --> 01:34:08,821
I sent her some money,

1409
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:10,291
so if you play
your cards right,

1410
01:34:10,361 --> 01:34:13,521
you can probably get her
to buy you something.

1411
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:16,031
As for my little helper,
I'm sorry to have to tell you

1412
01:34:16,101 --> 01:34:18,291
that him and his
prune-faced, mail-order wife

1413
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:20,631
are gonna be exploring
mountains with your dad.

1414
01:34:20,701 --> 01:34:23,001
I hope your dad doesn't go
sucking shit from them

1415
01:34:23,071 --> 01:34:24,301
like I did.

1416
01:34:24,371 --> 01:34:27,141
They're supposed to let me
out of this hospital room soon,

1417
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:29,301
so get some sandwiches ready.

1418
01:34:29,381 --> 01:34:32,471
Until then, don't take
no shit from nobody,

1419
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:34,141
least of all yourself.

1420
01:34:34,221 --> 01:34:36,271
Ho ho ho.

1421
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:39,111
Your pal, Santa. "

1422
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:43,221
Hey, loser.

1423
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:48,261
I hear your buddy's not here
to protect you anymore.

1424
01:34:49,931 --> 01:34:52,161
See you got me a new bike.

1425
01:34:52,231 --> 01:34:54,001
Thanks a lot.

1426
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:56,401
I'm talking to you, fat-ass!

1427
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:58,201
Aaah!
