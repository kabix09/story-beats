1
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,290
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,570
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,570
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,650
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,450
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,291
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,210
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,690
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,570
Sorry.

10
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,570
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,690
Just this way.

12
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,930
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,530
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,570
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,170
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,330
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,130
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,530
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,930
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,810
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,770
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,930
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,850
And you want to live in London?

24
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,970
Very much. Very much.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,290
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,210
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,690
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,810
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,690
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,810
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,250
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,490
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,970
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,290
All that stuff.

35
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,850
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,850
So it's all good.

37
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,450
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,210
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,090
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,970
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,170
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,250
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,090
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,650
Very good.

45
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,810
Chris Wilton.

46
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,650
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,650
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,450
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,250
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,490
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,850
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,450
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,130
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,530
OK.

55
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,650
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,810
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,610
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,970
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,890
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,370
For a while.

61
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,970
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,810
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,370
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,330
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,730
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,610
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,250
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

68
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,010
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,210
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,330
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,650
I love opera.

72
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,850
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

73
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,810
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,210
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,290
To the opera?

76
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,810
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,370
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,490
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,410
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,090
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,330
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,410
So?

83
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,490
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,650
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,530
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,530
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,370
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,650
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,370
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,490
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,130
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,250
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,650
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,850
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,290
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,930
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,650
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,730
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,690
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,730
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,130
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,370
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

103
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,290
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,530
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,610
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,130
Lt'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,930
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,810
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

109
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,850
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,770
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,690
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

112
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,490
OK.

113
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,730
Was I dreadful?

114
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,570
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,530
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,930
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,890
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,930
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,050
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,690
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,690
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,490
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,410
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,050
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,370
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,170
I love it.

127
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,650
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,050
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,330
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,050
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,850
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,170
That'd be great.

133
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,210
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,010
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,850
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,610
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,970
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,930
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,170
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,650
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,410
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,890
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,450
I can do that.

144
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,970
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,810
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,770
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,010
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,810
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,130
You?

150
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,730
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,290
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,730
What did I walk into?

153
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,090
What did I walk into?

154
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,410
It's like this.

155
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,210
- May I?
- Please.

156
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,450
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,290
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,530
The story of my life.

159
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,050
So, tell me,

160
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,890
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,210
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,370
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,930
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,330
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,410
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,850
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,410
There you are.

168
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,530
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

169
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,650
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancÃ©e.

170
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,930
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,970
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,410
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,370
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,450
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,850
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,930
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,130
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,330
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,810
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,970
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,730
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,490
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,090
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,170
To be honest with you,

186
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,530
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,890
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,050
Especially an American one.

189
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,010
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,770
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,850
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,450
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,850
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,330
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,330
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,010
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,730
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,970
Do you need money?

199
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,850
God, no.

200
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,730
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,490
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,170
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,730
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,050
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,010
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,330
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,010
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,850
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,810
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,130
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,650
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,010
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,050
Can't we do something for him?

214
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,450
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,810
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,530
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,850
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,970
Chloe, be careful.

219
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,970
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,970
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,890
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,810
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,130
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,450
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,850
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,970
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,530
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,490
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,490
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,770
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,410
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,890
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,770
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,530
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,490
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,050
Thanks.

237
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,090
What do you think?

238
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,050
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,890
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,650
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,210
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,010
I think it is.

244
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,450
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,170
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,450
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,370
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,530
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,090
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,210
To?

251
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,250
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

252
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,250
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,370
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,650
Of course.

255
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,890
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,090
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,610
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,730
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,970
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,410
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,290
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,130
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,650
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,610
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,490
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,170
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,690
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,810
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,130
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,530
Hello.

271
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,010
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,810
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

273
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,850
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,730
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,010
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,650
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

277
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,850
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,810
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,090
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,050
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,530
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,690
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,730
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,530
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,770
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,970
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,650
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,090
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,890
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,290
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,330
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,010
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,530
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,410
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,090
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,890
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,890
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,490
"So-so."

299
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,530
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,490
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,290
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,330
He was kind of austere.

303
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,530
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,610
Oh, Christ.

305
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,610
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,090
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,450
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,210
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,130
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,810
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,650
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,530
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,170
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,850
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,730
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,490
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,170
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,370
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,210
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,530
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,810
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,730
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,730
No purpose, no design.

325
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,450
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,410
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,490
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,210
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,690
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,050
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,410
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,130
Can we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,490
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,210
No, I was...

335
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,890
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,410
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,130
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

338
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,490
Ever.

339
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,050
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,090
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:45,570
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

342
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,250
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

343
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,530
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

344
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,130
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

345
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,450
Hi, Alan. How are you?

346
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,130
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

347
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,370
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

348
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,410
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,170
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

350
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,970
Now, if you're OK with the package,

351
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,210
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

352
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,090
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

353
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,210
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

354
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,250
And Rod.

355
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,530
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

356
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,970
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

357
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,170
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

358
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,810
It's such good news.

359
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,530
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

360
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,050
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,610
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

362
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,490
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

363
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,210
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

364
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,250
It has some beautiful arias on it.

365
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,050
And his voice expresses

366
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,450
everything that's tragic about life.

367
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,210
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

368
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,970
I love it.

369
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,210
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

370
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,770
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

371
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,410
Puligny-Montrachet.

372
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,810
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

373
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,210
Now I'm addicted.

374
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,010
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

375
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,770
but I told them we're busy.

376
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,490
But we have no plans.

377
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,530
Well, no special plans.

378
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,450
I thought we said we'd stay in?

379
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,090
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

380
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,770
We could've joined them.

381
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,290
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

382
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,730
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

383
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,810
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

384
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,170
Well, shall I call them?

385
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,890
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

386
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,250
Well...

387
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,210
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

388
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,770
The wine, the opera.

389
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,850
Absolutely.

390
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,210
I just figured...

391
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,850
We can stay in any... any night, and...

392
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,930
...they're free and suggested a film.

393
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,330
What's the film?

394
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,050
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

395
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,010
I am in the mood for a film.

396
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,210
Thank you so much, fella.

397
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,410
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

398
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,650
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

399
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,290
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

400
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,730
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

401
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,770
Where is she?

402
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,330
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

403
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,490
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

404
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,130
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,330
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

406
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,890
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

407
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,730
Everybody likes you at work.

408
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,370
Papa says he's heard great things.

409
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,130
You're a very clever boy.

410
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,450
Hey!

411
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,170
Hey.

412
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,850
- Hi.
- How are you?

413
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,570
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

414
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,450
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

415
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,930
It's vicuÃ±a.

416
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,450
- VicuÃ±a.
- VicuÃ±a?

417
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,770
- Yeah.
- Right.

418
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,890
Where are you going?

419
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,650
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

420
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,690
- Why?
- So...

421
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,250
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

422
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,890
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

423
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,610
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

424
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,130
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

425
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,650
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

426
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,010
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

427
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,130
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

428
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,810
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

429
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,970
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

430
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,450
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

431
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,050
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

432
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,410
Have you ever tried yoga?

433
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,170
- No.
- No?

434
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,410
Hi.

435
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,450
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

436
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,330
- How was it?
- Blew that.

437
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,610
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

438
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,290
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

439
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,610
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

440
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,010
Yeah.

441
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,250
You know what,

442
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,210
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

443
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,730
...a little bit.
- Sure.

444
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,770
- OK.
- This way.

445
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,130
What was I saying?

446
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,010
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

447
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,770
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

448
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,170
You should see my sister, she's...

449
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,410
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

450
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,250
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

451
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,890
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

452
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,730
My sister...

453
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,570
...is classically beautiful.

454
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,690
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

455
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,650
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

456
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,330
It's just a joke.

457
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,930
What did your father do?

458
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,730
He... left.

459
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,370
And never sent any money.

460
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,810
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

461
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,610
- No?
- No.

462
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,050
Her problem was that she drank.

463
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,330
How did you meet Tom?

464
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,530
We met at a party.

465
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,810
He...

466
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,610
...saw me across the room

467
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,930
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

468
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,410
And I...

469
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,330
I liked him right off, you know.

470
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,210
I thought...

471
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,210
Well, I think he's very handsome.

472
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,530
Don't you?

473
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,450
Very.

474
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,770
And he asked you to marry him?

475
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,050
Well, he...

476
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,930
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

477
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,930
What did I know
about that kind of life?

478
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,130
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

479
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,650
But...

480
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,170
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

481
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,010
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

482
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,490
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

483
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,530
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

484
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,050
It's such an inbred family. It's...

485
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,490
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

486
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,450
I thought he was very handsome.

487
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,490
You know, and I told you I was just...

488
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,010
I was overwhelmed with attention.

489
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,290
So, what about you and Chloe?

490
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,330
She's very sweet.

491
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,410
She is very sweet.

492
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,650
And she wants to marry you.

493
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,330
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

494
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,610
No. No, it's different.

495
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,130
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

496
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,170
...are being groomed.

497
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,930
You mark my words.

498
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,370
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

499
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,090
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

500
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,650
But...

501
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,810
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

502
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,010
And how am I going to blow it?

503
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,010
By making a pass at me.

504
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,570
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

505
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,170
Men always seem to wonder.

506
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,290
They think I'd be
something very special.

507
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,330
And are you?

508
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,330
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

509
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,850
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

510
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,650
I've had too much to drink.

511
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,130
Can you get me a cab?

512
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,210
Sure.

513
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,450
Thank you.

514
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,530
You were driving a bit fast,

515
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,090
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

516
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,050
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

517
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,090
Oh, hi.

518
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,370
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

519
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,490
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

520
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,970
Oh, he's so sweet.

521
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,970
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

522
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,010
It should have dissipated fully already.

523
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,330
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

524
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,970
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

525
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,930
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

526
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,730
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

527
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,650
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

528
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,730
You're so beautiful.

529
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:19,050
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

530
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,410
that the company would pay for?

531
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,050
I don't know.

532
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,810
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

533
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,970
And the beginning of next year

534
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,970
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

535
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,970
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

536
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,850
Plus, there are a number of perks...

537
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,970
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

538
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,570
We had been focusing on someone else...

539
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,010
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

540
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,450
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

541
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,090
I'd hate to disappoint you.

542
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,890
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

543
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,930
We're nearly ready.

544
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,410
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

545
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,370
Never mind, fella.

546
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,050
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

547
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,010
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

548
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,530
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

549
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,570
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

550
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,810
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

551
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,850
Come on, Chloe.

552
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,690
Hi, darling.

553
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,370
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

554
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,770
No.

555
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,610
How did your audition go?

556
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,970
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

557
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,890
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

558
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,810
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

559
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,330
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

560
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,650
So, how long do you keep it up?

561
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,530
How long?

562
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,890
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

563
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,490
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

564
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,250
To try something else?

565
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,970
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

566
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,050
I'm not saying that.

567
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,810
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

568
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,610
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

569
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,810
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

570
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,130
Well, I do ask myself that.

571
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,330
See? It's only logical, Tom.

572
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,690
Especially for a woman.

573
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,610
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

574
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,410
and as you get older and time passes,

575
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,730
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

576
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,330
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

577
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,970
I'm not saying now.

578
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,010
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

579
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,090
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

580
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,650
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

581
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,890
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

582
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,010
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

583
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:03,010
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

584
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,450
...innuendos.

585
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,170
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

586
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,290
Those that have it, know it right off.

587
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,890
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

588
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,810
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

589
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,890
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

590
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,810
Excuse me.

591
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,450
Nola.

592
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,730
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

593
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,730
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

594
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,010
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

595
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,610
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

596
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,930
I was looking for you.

597
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,090
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

598
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,130
I don't mean to intrude.

599
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,290
I need a drink.

600
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,130
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

601
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,170
- Do I?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,610
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

603
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,290
You shouldn't have followed me here.

604
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,370
Do you feel guilty?

605
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,650
Do you?

606
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,650
We can't do this.

607
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,290
I know.

608
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,490
This can't lead anyplace.

609
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,370
Hello.

610
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,410
Darling, I think it's for you.

611
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,290
But take it outside.

612
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,930
Well, there's hope, at least.

613
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,170
When's the callback?

614
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,410
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

615
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,690
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

616
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,570
Yeah. OK.

617
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,730
Bye.

618
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,490
Why have you been so cold to me?

619
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,290
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

620
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,530
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

621
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,010
you've been distant, evasive.

622
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,210
I don't want to encourage anything.

623
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,610
What happened, happened, Chris.

624
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,650
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

625
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,410
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

626
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,210
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

627
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,330
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

628
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,690
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

629
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,410
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

630
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,290
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

631
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,650
We had our moment.

632
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,210
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

633
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,530
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

634
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,570
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

635
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,890
Chris, forget it. It's over.

636
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,530
Thanks. Henry!

637
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,250
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

638
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,850
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

639
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,210
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

640
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,010
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

641
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,810
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

642
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,250
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

643
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,930
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

644
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,730
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

645
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,530
I just couldn't stand it.

646
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,930
No. No, I heard you went into business.

647
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,210
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

648
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,730
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

649
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,330
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

650
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,010
Family's got nothing but money.

651
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,250
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

652
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,410
Hey, look, I understand.

653
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,170
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

654
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,770
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

655
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,330
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

656
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,330
I always admired
your game though, you know?

657
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,810
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

658
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,490
Cool under pressure, but creative.

659
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,730
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

660
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,210
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

661
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,090
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

662
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,170
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

663
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,530
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

664
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,890
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

665
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,650
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

666
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,410
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

667
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,490
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

668
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,890
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

669
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,130
So good to see you, Henry.

670
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,570
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

671
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,010
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

672
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,130
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

673
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,290
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

674
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,210
- All right.
- Bye.

675
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,650
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

676
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,970
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

677
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,050
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

678
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,650
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

679
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,730
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

680
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,050
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

681
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,170
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

682
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,210
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

683
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,250
Stop it.

684
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,410
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

685
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,250
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

686
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,570
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

687
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,050
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

688
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,410
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

689
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,530
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

690
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,850
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

691
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,330
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

692
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,490
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

693
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,890
I appreciate that.

694
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,530
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

695
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,250
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

696
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,450
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

697
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,490
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

698
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,930
It was all her fault, you know.

699
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,770
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

700
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,850
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

701
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,330
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

702
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,450
All men who see you want to attack you.

703
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,730
Isn't that right, Christopher?

704
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,370
Oh, God, are you all right?

705
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,770
I'm fine.

706
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,210
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

707
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,170
I now pronounce you man and wife.

708
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,290
You may kiss the bride.

709
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,250
Oh, my God.

710
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,570
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

711
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,610
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

712
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,650
There's another bedroom through there.

713
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,690
The bathroom and a kitchen.

714
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,810
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

715
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,930
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

716
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,650
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

717
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,690
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

718
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,530
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

719
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,770
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

720
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,850
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

721
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,050
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

722
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,130
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

723
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,210
I want you to make me pregnant.

724
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,610
Chloe... We discussed this.

725
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,570
It's very quick.

726
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,730
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

727
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,450
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

728
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,570
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

729
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,010
Hey! Where are you?

730
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,330
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

731
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,090
Not good.

732
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,050
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

733
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,250
What?

734
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,730
Well, Nola and I...

735
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,610
...broke up.

736
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,850
- No!
- Yeah.

737
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,210
Or, I should say, I called it off.

738
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,890
I thought you were gonna get married.

739
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,130
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

740
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,770
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

741
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,970
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

742
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,690
who's her main candidate.

743
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,610
God, no.

744
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,530
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

745
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,010
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

746
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,490
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

747
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,490
...l've met someone else.

748
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,610
- No!
- Yeah.

749
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:15,890
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

750
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,330
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

751
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,690
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

752
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,730
You know what I mean.

753
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,210
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,530
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,930
Excuse me.

756
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,450
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

757
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,290
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

758
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,850
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

759
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,690
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

760
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,570
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

761
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,410
Just business.

762
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,530
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

763
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,090
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

764
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,290
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

765
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,410
OK, I can take a hint.

766
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:03,090
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

767
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,570
Look...

768
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,970
...it'll happen.

769
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,490
I'm just really tired.

770
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,930
Kiss.

771
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,410
Sweet dreams.

772
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,650
I now pronounce you man and wife.

773
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,850
You may kiss the bride.

774
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,010
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

775
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,050
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

776
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,010
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,250
I know.

778
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:52,610
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

779
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,690
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

780
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,770
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

781
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,290
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

782
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,330
I want my own children.

783
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,210
This one?

784
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,610
Sort of...

785
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,130
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

786
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,370
Really?

787
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,370
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

788
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,450
Her and her husband
just found each other.

789
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,490
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

790
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,570
and itjust works like a charm.

791
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,850
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

792
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,690
- God...
- I know, it's great.

793
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,770
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

794
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,410
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

795
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,570
If I have to work all night.

796
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,650
OK.

797
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,850
Thank you. Thanks.

798
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,610
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

799
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,730
Thanks.

800
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,290
Are you OK, sir?

801
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,170
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

802
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,930
No, not really.

803
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,490
Oh, Christ!

804
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,570
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

805
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,650
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

806
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,010
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

807
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,610
Not before.

808
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,450
Good night.

809
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,690
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

810
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,570
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

811
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,130
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

812
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,450
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

813
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,530
Yeah?

814
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,370
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

815
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,330
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

816
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,410
Why?

817
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,370
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

818
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,130
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

819
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:45,210
I'm coming.

820
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,850
- OK.
- OK.

821
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,130
Hello.

822
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,370
What a surprise.

823
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,770
I...

824
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,610
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

825
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,370
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

826
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,050
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

827
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,370
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

828
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,610
I looked for you.

829
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,570
For what?

830
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,690
You're still so angry.

831
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,690
Where are you living?

832
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,050
In town. Why?

833
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,010
You live alone?

834
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,610
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

835
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,090
Can I meet you for a drink?

836
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,010
Talk?

837
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,450
Where can I reach you? Come on.

838
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,690
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

839
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,810
Look who I bumped into.

840
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:48,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

841
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,690
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

842
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:53,050
- You look great.
- Thanks.

843
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,810
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

844
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,010
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

845
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,690
Yeah. They've got a baby.

846
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,890
You know Tom, all settled down.

847
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,570
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

848
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,970
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

849
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,290
- Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,850
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

851
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,010
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

852
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,410
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

853
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,250
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

854
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,730
Say your phone number.

855
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,170
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

856
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,890
- Chris...
- Please.

857
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,050
Say your phone number.

858
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:39,250
02079460996.

859
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,210
I'll call you.

860
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,490
Bye.

861
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,050
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

862
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,050
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

863
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,810
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

864
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,010
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

865
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,370
It's OK, John.

866
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,250
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

867
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,050
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

868
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,650
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

869
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:05,890
- OK.
- See you at home.

870
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,970
Bye.

871
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,570
You have a very charming flat.

872
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,450
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

873
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,330
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

874
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,170
I mean, it's not perfect.

875
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,210
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

876
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,370
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

877
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,250
...you know, the lobby's decent.

878
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,250
The key word is it's cheap.

879
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,170
What time is it?

880
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,370
Time for you to go.

881
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,930
It's so hard to leave you.

882
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,210
Beautiful woman.

883
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,930
How'd you sleep?

884
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,450
Good.

885
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,290
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

886
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,370
about that earthquake in China?

887
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,970
Terrible.

888
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,050
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

889
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,050
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

890
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,530
Yeah.

891
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:05,290
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

892
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,730
Papa's getting so into the idea.

893
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,970
It should be good for you.

894
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,330
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

895
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,650
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

896
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,690
...before you went to work.

897
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,850
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

898
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,370
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

899
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,370
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

900
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,090
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

901
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:50,410
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

902
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,930
Let me come up.

903
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,890
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

904
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,330
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

905
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,850
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

906
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,410
Come on.

907
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,890
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

908
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,330
Hey, did you get that pest control?

909
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,570
Oh, yes. Yes.

910
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,090
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

911
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,610
It's much better than cheese,

912
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,010
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

913
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,490
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

914
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,050
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

915
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,330
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

916
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,370
Bye.

917
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,690
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

918
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,810
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

919
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,370
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

920
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,810
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

921
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,130
Yeah.

922
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,810
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

923
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,810
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

924
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,250
Heths didn't have a problem

925
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,250
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

926
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,290
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

927
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,530
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

928
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,770
- No.
- Yeah.

929
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,570
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

930
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,570
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

931
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,250
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

932
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:40,010
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

933
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,210
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

934
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,650
But she's just such an odd girl.

935
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:47,570
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

936
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,450
But something's just...

937
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,210
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

938
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,810
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

939
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,050
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

940
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,890
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

941
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,090
but, I don't know...

942
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,450
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

943
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:09,610
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

944
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,730
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

945
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,050
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

946
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,970
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

947
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,890
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

948
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,050
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

949
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,490
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

950
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,530
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

951
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,690
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

952
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,090
I know Tom's dying to get away.

953
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,730
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

954
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,810
Me?

955
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,970
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

956
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,130
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

957
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,970
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

958
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,210
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

959
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,330
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

960
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,810
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

961
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,010
I'd have sworn it was you.

962
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,210
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

963
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,170
He's completely dependant on our driver.

964
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,490
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

965
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:56,330
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

966
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,570
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

967
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,170
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

968
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,450
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

969
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,890
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

970
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,330
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

971
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,530
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

972
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,570
Nuts.

973
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,290
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

974
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,210
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

975
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,490
Just the Sarazin people at two.

976
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,690
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

977
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:24,010
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

978
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,730
Chris. Where are you off to?

979
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,890
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

980
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:34,130
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

981
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,130
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

982
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:41,090
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

983
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,930
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

984
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,850
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

985
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:48,410
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

986
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,970
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

987
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,170
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

988
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,130
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

989
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,610
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

990
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,050
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

991
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,170
It's a hard field.

992
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,730
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

993
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,650
Tom's mother was right.
Itjust gets to a point, you know?

994
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,490
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

995
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,530
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

996
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:15,650
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

997
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,370
Maybe I will.

998
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,850
Don't say that unless you mean it.

999
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,970
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

1000
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,090
I mean, it's... mechanical.

1001
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,490
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

1002
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,810
Really. I mean it.

1003
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,330
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

1004
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,090
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

1005
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,370
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

1006
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,290
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

1007
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,530
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

1008
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:57,050
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

1009
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,770
Hi.

1010
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,170
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

1011
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,770
I've been thinking about you.

1012
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:10,490
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

1013
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,410
OK. See you then.

1014
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,050
Bye-bye.

1015
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,610
There you are, Chris.

1016
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:22,050
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

1017
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,890
over the past few months.

1018
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:26,890
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

1019
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,770
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

1020
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,650
Well, who could have predicted these?

1021
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,010
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

1022
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,930
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

1023
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,530
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

1024
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,650
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

1025
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:44,810
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

1026
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,250
Yes.

1027
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:50,010
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

1028
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,050
- Boat.
- Boat.

1029
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,330
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

1030
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,770
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

1031
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,090
- What?
- No.

1032
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:56,690
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

1033
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:59,610
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

1034
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:00,690
Oh, that reminds me,

1035
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,210
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1036
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,290
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

1037
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:06,890
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1038
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,810
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

1039
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:09,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1040
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:12,450
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

1041
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,530
Oh, God.

1042
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,050
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

1043
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:18,090
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1044
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,010
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

1045
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,770
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

1046
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,770
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

1047
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,850
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

1048
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:28,890
Poor thing.

1049
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,570
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

1050
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,650
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

1051
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,410
I miss you.

1052
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,210
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

1053
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,770
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

1054
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,970
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

1055
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,130
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

1056
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,810
When can you get here?

1057
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,250
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

1058
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,650
Look...

1059
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,050
It's a three-day weekend.

1060
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,890
Tuesday.

1061
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:56,450
Chris, I need to see you.

1062
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,290
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

1063
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,810
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1064
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:05,850
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

1065
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,490
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

1066
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,970
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

1067
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:11,010
Jack Garner?

1068
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,130
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

1069
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,490
The traffic'll be terrible.

1070
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,970
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

1071
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:18,010
I don't mean today.

1072
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,770
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

1073
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,170
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

1074
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,050
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

1075
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,650
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

1076
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,490
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

1077
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,570
That's mean.

1078
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,650
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

1079
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,210
I've some lovely new horses.

1080
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:33,890
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

1081
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,930
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

1082
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,090
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

1083
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,970
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

1084
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,650
- No.
- Yeah.

1085
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,250
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

1086
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:43,450
- Where from?
- Anyway...

1087
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:45,930
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

1088
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,810
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

1089
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,410
Excuse me.

1090
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,730
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

1091
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,490
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1092
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,610
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

1093
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,050
Hello?

1094
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,290
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

1095
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,730
Are you mad calling me here?

1096
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,970
When are you coming over?

1097
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,050
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1098
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,210
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

1099
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:17,130
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

1100
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:25,290
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1101
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,850
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

1102
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:31,010
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

1103
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:34,690
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

1104
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,290
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

1105
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,690
Well, they only had biscuits.

1106
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:41,130
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

1107
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,970
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

1108
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,170
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

1109
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,530
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

1110
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,850
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1111
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,090
It's no big deal.

1112
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:56,330
I'll pop back into town.

1113
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,410
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

1114
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:02,170
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

1115
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,850
Well, it is a pity because I...

1116
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:06,130
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

1117
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,570
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1118
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:09,770
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1119
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,490
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

1120
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,050
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1121
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,130
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

1122
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:14,290
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1123
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,970
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1124
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,850
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

1125
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,490
but you couldn't wait.

1126
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,290
What unbelievable bad luck.

1127
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:27,170
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

1128
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,050
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

1129
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,930
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

1130
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,010
Is that your interpretation?

1131
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,170
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

1132
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,810
not as part of some fertility project.

1133
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:38,810
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

1134
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:40,650
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

1135
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,250
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

1136
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,850
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

1137
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,730
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

1138
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,770
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

1139
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,850
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

1140
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,850
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

1141
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,890
Why? You hate yourjob,
you hate your life.

1142
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,650
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

1143
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,410
Look, Nola, I have to go.

1144
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,450
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

1145
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,090
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

1146
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,050
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

1147
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,370
Chris...

1148
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,570
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

1149
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:16,170
I'm not walking away from this.

1150
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:20,770
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1151
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,210
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

1152
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,330
Us.

1153
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,770
Is something wrong?

1154
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:36,010
Yeah. There is.

1155
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,490
What?

1156
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,610
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

1157
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,170
you know it's not a problem.

1158
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,370
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

1159
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,770
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

1160
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,370
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

1161
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:59,130
What is it?

1162
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:07,010
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

1163
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,370
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

1164
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:18,130
Are you having an affair?

1165
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,330
Am I having an affair?

1166
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,490
Yeah, that's what I asked.

1167
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:27,890
- No.
- You are.

1168
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,130
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

1169
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,450
Do you not love me anymore?

1170
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,850
Of course I love you.

1171
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,250
Well, what's wrong?

1172
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,690
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

1173
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,770
You're not. How?

1174
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,410
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

1175
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,730
I just...

1176
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:12,770
...feel so guilty.

1177
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:16,290
So terribly guilty.

1178
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,690
Listen, Chris.

1179
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,210
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

1180
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,730
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

1181
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:32,690
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

1182
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:38,410
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

1183
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,090
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1184
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,250
Oh, Chloe.

1185
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,450
Let's get off the subject.

1186
01:13:56,490 --> 01:14:00,490
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

1187
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:04,330
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

1188
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,970
I had to talk to somebody.

1189
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,610
I'm really suffering.

1190
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:15,770
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1191
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:20,010
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

1192
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,370
But when the time came to tell her...

1193
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,010
...I couldn't do it.

1194
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,570
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

1195
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,410
It's crazy.

1196
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:36,410
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

1197
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,850
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

1198
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:42,250
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

1199
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,930
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

1200
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,690
Right.

1201
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:50,570
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

1202
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,170
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

1203
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:59,090
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1204
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:02,570
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

1205
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,810
Is it for a woman you love?

1206
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,610
To live how? Where?

1207
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,890
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

1208
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,850
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

1209
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:16,010
There must be anotherjob in another
firm that you can just, you know...

1210
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,130
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

1211
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,330
And he loves me.

1212
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,930
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

1213
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:27,570
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

1214
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,450
We're going away for three weeks.

1215
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:33,570
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

1216
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:37,050
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

1217
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,410
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

1218
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:42,650
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

1219
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:45,730
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

1220
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,810
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

1221
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,290
which is all you ever tell me...

1222
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,130
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

1223
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,410
It's a big blow.

1224
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,610
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

1225
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:02,050
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

1226
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,210
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

1227
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,890
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

1228
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,050
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

1229
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:13,370
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

1230
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:15,450
Hey, keep your voice down.

1231
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,690
You know I make love to her.

1232
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,250
And you know it's just routine.

1233
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,730
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

1234
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,730
Yeah.

1235
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:32,890
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

1236
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:34,610
It will.

1237
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,170
- It will.
- OK.

1238
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,610
The holiday's off.

1239
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,130
Why? What happened?

1240
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,370
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

1241
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,610
Why?

1242
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,090
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

1243
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,930
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1244
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:58,250
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

1245
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,770
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1246
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,410
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

1247
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,170
Yeah.

1248
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,250
Hello?

1249
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,250
Hello?

1250
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,290
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

1251
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,330
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

1252
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:57,410
Really?

1253
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,490
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

1254
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,690
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

1255
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:07,170
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1256
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,490
assuming our predictions are correct.

1257
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,970
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

1258
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,010
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

1259
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:17,010
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

1260
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:19,130
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

1261
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:21,210
You already are a young grandmother.

1262
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,530
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

1263
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:25,610
but I'd like you to be a mother.

1264
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,890
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

1265
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:31,130
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

1266
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,930
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

1267
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,970
Great. You forgot.

1268
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:37,690
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

1269
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,450
So my hints worked.

1270
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,610
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

1271
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:43,690
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

1272
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:46,010
- Hello?
- Chris?

1273
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,330
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

1274
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:48,890
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

1275
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,570
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

1276
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,210
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1277
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,610
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

1278
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,930
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

1279
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,570
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

1280
01:18:58,650 --> 01:18:59,970
I've been waiting a week.

1281
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,930
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

1282
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,050
When are you coming home?

1283
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,610
In about two weeks.

1284
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,330
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

1285
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,770
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

1286
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,650
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1287
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,610
OK. OK...

1288
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:16,530
Who is that? What country are you in?

1289
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,650
Your mobile's been impossible.

1290
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,170
I told you. I'm in Greece.

1291
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:23,690
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

1292
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:26,370
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

1293
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:29,370
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

1294
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,850
Can you just?

1295
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,490
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

1296
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,290
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

1297
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,650
Do you miss me?

1298
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,690
OK. Bye, bye.

1299
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:43,970
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1300
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:45,770
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

1301
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:15,090
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

1302
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,090
Sardinia.

1303
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:19,450
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

1304
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:32,410
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

1305
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,250
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

1306
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,610
You lied to me.

1307
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,250
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

1308
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:44,810
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

1309
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,650
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

1310
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,690
Look, Christ, Christ.

1311
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:48,970
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

1312
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,290
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

1313
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,530
I can explain. I... Taxi!

1314
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,930
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

1315
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,210
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

1316
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,130
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

1317
01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:59,690
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

1318
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:02,250
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

1319
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,930
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

1320
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:08,850
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

1321
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:10,850
You're a liar!

1322
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:17,730
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

1323
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,610
I only came back
the day before yesterday

1324
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:21,850
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

1325
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,730
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

1326
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:26,770
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

1327
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,610
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

1328
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,010
I was about to when you called.

1329
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,130
What does that have to do with anything?

1330
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:32,370
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

1331
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,970
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

1332
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,090
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

1333
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:38,810
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

1334
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:41,330
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

1335
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,010
Well, she has to know eventually.

1336
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,290
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

1337
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,370
Nola, stop!

1338
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,690
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

1339
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,330
We don't have to have a child together.

1340
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,170
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1341
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,290
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1342
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,650
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

1343
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,370
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

1344
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,370
Nola, be reasonable.

1345
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,450
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

1346
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,690
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

1347
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,090
So, you're threatening me?

1348
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,770
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

1349
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:13,690
Were you lying to me?

1350
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,250
All those times we made love,

1351
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,330
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

1352
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,930
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

1353
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:24,850
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

1354
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:29,570
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

1355
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,050
Have you seen Chris?

1356
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,130
A minute ago. He went that way.

1357
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,250
Chris?

1358
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,210
Chris?

1359
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,170
Chris?

1360
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,730
Where are you, Chris?

1361
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,010
Chris?

1362
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:53,810
Chloe, are you there?

1363
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,370
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

1364
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:57,730
No. Could you come up for a minute?

1365
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:00,410
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

1366
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,010
Yeah, OK.

1367
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:30,530
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

1368
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:33,330
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

1369
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:36,410
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

1370
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,490
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

1371
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:41,450
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1372
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:43,530
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1373
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:46,370
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

1374
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:49,170
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

1375
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,770
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

1376
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,930
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

1377
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,490
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

1378
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,610
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

1379
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:01,210
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

1380
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:03,370
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

1381
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:06,730
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

1382
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,770
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1383
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:13,050
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

1384
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,650
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1385
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:18,250
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

1386
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,530
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

1387
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:25,010
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

1388
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:26,290
Did you hate it?

1389
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:29,010
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

1390
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,970
I thought you were gonna pass out.

1391
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:33,330
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

1392
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,610
I still can't do it with you tonight.

1393
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:41,090
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1394
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:48,330
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

1395
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,530
No. What are you doing?

1396
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,290
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1397
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,290
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

1398
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:57,210
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1399
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,010
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

1400
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,930
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

1401
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,050
Is this it?

1402
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,690
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

1403
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,690
I've got to have words
with her about it.

1404
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,370
It's really...

1405
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:15,170
What did you just put in your pocket?

1406
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,850
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

1407
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,290
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

1408
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,050
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

1409
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,690
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

1410
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,370
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

1411
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,650
- Guess what?
- What?

1412
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:29,130
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

1413
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:31,170
You haven't. That's not like you.

1414
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,490
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

1415
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:36,370
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

1416
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,170
No, that's not so.

1417
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:41,690
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

1418
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:43,690
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

1419
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,130
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

1420
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:47,930
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1421
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:51,610
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

1422
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:54,650
You're so sweet.

1423
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,210
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

1424
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:03,050
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

1425
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:04,930
OK, I will.

1426
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,570
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

1427
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:14,090
When you get off work today,
come right home.

1428
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,170
I have some good news.

1429
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:20,610
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1430
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,570
You've got to meet me
right after work.

1431
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:25,330
We have... plans to make.

1432
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:29,610
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

1433
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:31,410
It's good. This is good.

1434
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,290
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1435
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:36,730
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

1436
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:42,330
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

1437
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,570
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

1438
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:45,650
Yes.

1439
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:48,370
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1440
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:51,090
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

1441
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,210
Good.

1442
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:03,450
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

1443
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,610
for developing their capacity.

1444
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:08,210
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

1445
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:21,050
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

1446
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:25,570
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

1447
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,290
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

1448
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:38,010
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

1449
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:39,290
We met here last...

1450
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:41,770
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

1451
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,850
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

1452
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:48,490
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

1453
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:51,130
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

1454
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:54,210
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

1455
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,170
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

1456
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,650
Well, what's the trouble?

1457
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,570
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

1458
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:06,570
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

1459
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:10,130
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

1460
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:11,210
Yes.

1461
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:15,250
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

1462
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:18,530
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1463
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:20,610
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

1464
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:22,690
I have to take my medicine.

1465
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:42,650
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

1466
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:08,690
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1467
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,130
Mrs. Eastby?

1468
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,290
It's lan.

1469
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:07,290
Mrs. Eastby?

1470
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:14,290
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

1471
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:20,050
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

1472
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:27,050
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

1473
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:51,890
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

1474
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:54,650
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

1475
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:56,770
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

1476
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:57,850
Excellent.

1477
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:17,250
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

1478
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:49,210
Nola.

1479
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:01,010
Excuse me.

1480
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:11,970
Hello.

1481
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:14,010
Where are you?

1482
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:17,770
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

1483
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:50,930
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1484
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,010
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

1485
01:38:58,090 --> 01:38:59,610
Two pounds.

1486
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,730
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

1487
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:25,770
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1488
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:27,890
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

1489
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:29,970
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

1490
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:31,370
As he, or they, were running out

1491
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:33,930
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

1492
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,290
Either out of panic,

1493
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:38,370
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

1494
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:41,050
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

1495
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,250
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

1496
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:45,690
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

1497
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,130
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

1498
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:49,530
Probably cased her.

1499
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:51,970
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

1500
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:54,050
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1501
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,770
Some people just don't have any luck.

1502
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,770
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

1503
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:02,730
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

1504
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:04,410
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

1505
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:05,690
Do you need anything from the car?

1506
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:07,810
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

1507
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:11,130
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

1508
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:13,130
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1509
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,890
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

1510
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:16,330
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

1511
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:19,130
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

1512
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:20,930
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

1513
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:23,650
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1514
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:25,690
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,490
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

1516
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:28,690
No, hang on. If you just wait.

1517
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:31,130
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

1518
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:34,450
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

1519
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:37,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

1520
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:39,490
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

1521
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:41,450
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

1522
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:42,810
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

1523
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:45,050
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

1524
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:47,010
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

1525
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,530
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

1526
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:52,930
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

1527
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:55,010
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

1528
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,170
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1529
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,530
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

1530
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:01,450
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

1531
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:03,610
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

1532
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:05,090
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

1533
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:08,530
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1534
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,890
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

1535
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,650
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

1536
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:13,850
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

1537
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,890
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

1538
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:19,170
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

1539
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:23,210
Did you like the musical last night?

1540
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:27,850
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

1541
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:30,330
Yeah, he's very good.

1542
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:33,090
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

1543
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,210
Good.

1544
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:41,450
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1545
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:45,770
Oh, my God! Nola!

1546
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,610
- Nola Rice.
- What?

1547
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:52,610
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

1548
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:56,250
What? Here, let me see that.

1549
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:58,130
Jesus Christ!

1550
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,130
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

1551
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:08,170
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1552
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:10,770
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

1553
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:14,810
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

1554
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:17,170
Oh, my God.

1555
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:24,250
Hello?

1556
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:27,890
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

1557
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,530
Isn't itjust terrible?

1558
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:32,890
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

1559
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:35,970
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

1560
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:38,250
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

1561
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:40,570
I know.

1562
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:43,170
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

1563
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:45,010
Hello?

1564
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:47,570
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

1565
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:50,490
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

1566
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:51,930
I suppose she must've...

1567
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:54,650
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

1568
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:57,010
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

1569
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:58,810
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1570
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:01,090
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

1571
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:04,410
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

1572
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:06,370
over the past year.

1573
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:09,090
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1574
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:13,530
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

1575
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,250
Mummy.

1576
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:25,410
I've got something to tell you.

1577
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,490
But I want Chris to be here.

1578
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,690
Chris?

1579
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:33,730
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1580
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:35,810
He was just in here. Chris?

1581
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:38,490
Chris?

1582
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,170
He was just here.

1583
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:48,890
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1584
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:51,410
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

1585
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:25,930
Where are you? Chris?

1586
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:28,690
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1587
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,450
Well, I just really want him to be here.

1588
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,850
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

1589
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,530
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

1590
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:37,850
Well, I wanted you to be here.

1591
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,450
Well, what is it?

1592
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:41,010
Mummy...

1593
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,850
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

1594
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:45,650
It looks like I'm pregnant.

1595
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:47,970
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

1596
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:51,850
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

1597
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:53,970
Alec?

1598
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,770
Alec? Come here.

1599
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:59,410
We're both walking on air.

1600
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:02,610
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1601
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:04,570
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

1602
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:05,890
Chloe's pregnant.

1603
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:08,450
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1604
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:10,890
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

1605
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,610
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

1606
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,650
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1607
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,290
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

1608
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:17,730
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

1609
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,570
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

1610
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,090
Thank you, Margaret.

1611
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,490
Sam?

1612
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:28,130
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

1613
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:30,090
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1614
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:33,290
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1615
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,810
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

1616
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,850
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

1617
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:40,290
I bet it was that night...

1618
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:43,650
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

1619
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:49,610
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1620
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:51,850
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

1621
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:54,130
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

1622
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:55,770
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1623
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,410
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

1624
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:03,730
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

1625
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:06,970
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

1626
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:09,850
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

1627
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,690
Detective Banner, please.

1628
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:13,770
This is Chris Wilton.

1629
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:18,450
Oh, hello.

1630
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:21,010
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

1631
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,970
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

1632
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:26,290
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

1633
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:29,770
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

1634
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:33,130
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1635
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:38,210
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

1636
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:40,290
I certainly hope not.

1637
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:49,410
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

1638
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:52,490
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1639
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:55,410
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

1640
01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:59,530
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

1641
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:03,850
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

1642
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:06,290
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

1643
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,130
How?

1644
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:12,330
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

1645
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:14,130
That's...

1646
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:16,930
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

1647
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:22,010
They broke up. A year ago. More.

1648
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:25,450
When did you last see her?

1649
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:28,690
Oh, God, I can't remember.

1650
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:35,370
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

1651
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:37,890
But that was a long time ago.

1652
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:41,370
Have you seen her since?

1653
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:43,570
Not that I recall.

1654
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:47,970
Have?

1655
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,610
Have you ever seen this?

1656
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:53,570
No. What is it?

1657
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:57,490
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1658
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:08,690
No.

1659
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,690
As you can see...

1660
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:14,690
...you're all over it.

1661
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,290
Yes, I can see that.

1662
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:29,730
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

1663
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:32,330
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

1664
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:38,930
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

1665
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:41,930
But you people have to protect me here.

1666
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:45,650
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

1667
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:47,690
How long did your affair go on?

1668
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:55,810
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

1669
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:58,770
They broke up, she moved away.

1670
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:03,610
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

1671
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:08,010
God, have a heart.

1672
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,210
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1673
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:13,730
This will devastate her.

1674
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:16,330
Did you...

1675
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:20,570
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1676
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:23,050
No, I did not.

1677
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:25,770
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

1678
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:30,010
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

1679
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:38,170
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

1680
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:40,490
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

1681
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:42,650
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

1682
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:47,330
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

1683
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:51,050
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

1684
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:55,730
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

1685
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,850
But you did lead her on,

1686
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:00,730
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

1687
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:03,690
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

1688
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:06,530
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

1689
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:12,850
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

1690
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:16,330
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

1691
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:18,490
much less Nola Rice.

1692
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:26,770
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

1693
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,850
and she walked in when it was happening?

1694
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:34,250
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

1695
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:36,650
...wreck people's lives.

1696
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:39,810
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1697
01:51:40,890 --> 01:51:43,530
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

1698
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:46,010
OK, but I'm not your man.

1699
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:49,730
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1700
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:52,050
but that does not make me a murderer.

1701
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:55,130
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

1702
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:57,210
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

1703
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:58,890
And if we have to talk to you again,

1704
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:01,290
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

1705
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:02,890
Your personal life's your own.

1706
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:06,810
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

1707
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:19,090
I understand.

1708
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:21,650
Look...

1709
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,930
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

1710
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:26,010
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

1711
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:28,050
please call me on my mobile.

1712
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:30,530
This is my number.

1713
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:34,010
Thanks.

1714
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:35,690
One other thing.

1715
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:38,170
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1716
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:41,810
Me?

1717
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:43,210
No.

1718
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:47,170
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

1719
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:49,410
You can check it out, but...

1720
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:54,370
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

1721
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:56,530
Of course.

1722
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:01,490
Thank you.

1723
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:12,130
So, what do you think?

1724
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:14,450
I think it's what it looks like.

1725
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:16,570
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1726
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:20,210
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

1727
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:24,810
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

1728
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:26,890
He's 'specting a baby.

1729
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:29,490
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

1730
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,250
...we can find out discreetly enough

1731
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:35,330
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1732
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:41,290
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

1733
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:44,170
never mind sawing one off.

1734
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:47,970
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

1735
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:49,770
Not even a speeding ticket.

1736
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:52,650
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

1737
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:55,050
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

1738
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:57,370
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

1739
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:58,930
Well, come on, Mike.

1740
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,850
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

1741
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:03,050
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

1742
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:05,450
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1743
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:08,490
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

1744
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:13,170
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

1745
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:16,290
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

1746
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:18,210
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

1747
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:21,650
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

1748
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:24,010
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

1749
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,810
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

1750
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:26,250
Chris.

1751
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:37,970
Nola...

1752
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,290
...it wasn't easy.

1753
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:46,050
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

1754
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,930
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

1755
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:56,730
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

1756
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,690
You have to.

1757
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:02,290
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1758
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:04,530
And what about me?

1759
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:07,330
What about the next-door neighbor?

1760
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:11,090
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

1761
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:17,450
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

1762
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:23,770
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

1763
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:28,090
You were collateral damage.

1764
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:30,650
So was your own child.

1765
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:36,890
Sophocles said:

1766
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:40,570
"To never have been born

1767
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:43,650
may be the greatest boon of all."

1768
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:48,330
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

1769
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:51,410
Your actions were clumsy.

1770
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:53,170
Full of holes.

1771
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:56,450
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

1772
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:02,930
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

1773
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:04,890
and punished.

1774
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:09,730
At least there would be
some small sign ofjustice.

1775
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:12,810
Some small...

1776
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:16,930
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

1777
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:22,490
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

1778
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:24,330
What?

1779
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:27,090
It's as we speculated

1780
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:29,570
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

1781
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:32,730
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

1782
01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:34,490
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1783
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:35,570
He waited in the hall.

1784
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:37,530
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

1785
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:40,890
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

1786
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:43,090
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

1787
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:45,410
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

1788
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:48,010
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

1789
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:49,570
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1790
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:51,810
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

1791
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:53,650
and I am going to break this case.

1792
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:55,570
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

1793
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:56,610
What?

1794
01:58:56,690 --> 01:58:58,650
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1795
01:58:58,690 --> 01:58:59,970
What's the bad news?

1796
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:02,930
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

1797
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:05,730
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1798
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:09,050
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

1799
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:10,810
No, he didn't have to.

1800
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:14,090
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

1801
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:18,010
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

1802
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:22,210
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

1803
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:24,610
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1804
01:59:24,650 --> 01:59:26,930
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1805
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,650
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

1806
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:32,250
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1807
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:34,170
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

1808
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:36,570
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

1809
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:38,050
No, wait.

1810
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:42,090
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

1811
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:46,890
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

1812
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:49,690
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

1813
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:51,610
Come on.

1814
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:54,210
I give up.

1815
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:56,090
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

1816
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:58,490
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

1817
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:01,890
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1818
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:05,370
What a world. Am I right?

1819
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:08,810
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

1820
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:11,890
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

1821
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:13,930
Right. Champagne.

1822
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:16,210
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

1823
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,650
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

1824
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:21,970
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

1825
02:00:23,330 --> 02:00:24,890
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

1826
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:27,610
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

1827
02:00:27,690 --> 02:00:31,170
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1828
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:33,610
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

1829
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:35,170
Let's work on number two. Come on.

1830
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:38,610
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

1831
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:39,930
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

1832
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:42,050
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

1833
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:43,490
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

1834
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:45,050
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

1835
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:47,290
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

1836
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:48,330
Please do.

1837
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:49,490
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

1838
02:00:49,530 --> 02:00:51,770
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

1839
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:54,250
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

1840
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:57,130
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

1841
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:58,730
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

1842
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:00,730
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

1843
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:02,130
I just hope that he's lucky.

1844
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:03,810
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

1845
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:05,210
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

1846
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:07,130
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

1847
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:10,050
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

1848
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:11,490
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

1849
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:12,850
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

1850
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:15,090
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

1851
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,650
What are you saying about him?

1852
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:20,730
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

1853
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:24,770
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

1854
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:26,130
I wonder what he's thinking.

1855
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:27,450
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

1856
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:29,170
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

1857
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:31,170
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

1858
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,930
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
