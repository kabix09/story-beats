00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,913
As always, thank you
for your excellent guidance.

171
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,625
I'll let you get back
to Reginald's quivering member.

172
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,630
"Quivering member." I like that.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,925
Virgin alert. Your favorite.

174
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,142
Ooh. Lookin' good, ladies.

175
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,145
Oh, she's out of reach, even for you.

176
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,982
- No one's out of reach for me.
- You wanna put money on that?

177
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,026
Money, I've got.

178
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,944
This I'm gonna do for fun.

179
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,030
(SCOFFS)

180
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,950
- Who's that guy?
- That's Joey Donner.

181
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,620
He's a jerk off, and a model.

182
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,246
- (CHUCKLES) He's a model?
- A model.

183
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,583
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

184
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,168
- Really?
- Really.

185
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,802
Man, look at her. Is she always so...

186
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,262
- Vapid?
- How can you say that? She's totally...

187
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,139
- Conceited.
- What are you talking about?

188
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,016
There's more to her than you think.

189
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,437
Look at the way she smiles,
and look at her eyes, man.

190
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,858
She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.

191
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,528
No, no, Cameron, no. What's there

192
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,949
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sun dress

193
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,452
to make guys like us realize
that we can never touch her

194
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,372
and guys like Joey realize
that they want to.

195
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,084
She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.

196
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,169
Put her in your spank bank, move on.

197
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,089
- Move on.
- No, no. You're wrong about her.

198
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,508
I mean, you know,
not about the spanking part,

199
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,968
but the rest, you're wrong.

200
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,596
All right... I'm wrong?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.

201
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,515
She's actually looking
for a French tutor.

202
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,559
Are you serious? That's perfect!

203
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,769
Do you speak French?

204
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,063
Well, no, but I Will.

205
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,862
Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat.

206
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,866
- Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?
- Run along.

207
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,080
I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be underwhelmed,

208
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,708
but can you ever just be "whelmed"?

209
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,336
- I think you can in Europe.
- Hi, ladies.

210
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,214
Would you sweet young things
like a ride?

211
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,805
Careful on the leather.

212
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,684
Whoo!

213
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,228
That's a charming new development.

214
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,938
It's disgusting.

215
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,153
Remove head from sphincter,
then drive!

216
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,577
- You okay?
- Yeah.

217
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,288
Just a minor encounter with the shrew.

218
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,917
- That's your girlfriend's sister.
- That's Bianca's sister?

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,295
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

220
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,756
- (SIGHS) Stay cool, bro.
- Yeah, see you later.

221
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,759
Look out!

Hello, Katarina.
Make anyone cry today?

235
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,049
Sadly, no. But it's only 4:30.

236
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,845
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, precious.

237
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,514
- And where have you been?
- Nowhere.

238
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,183
Hey, what's this?
It says Sarah Lawrence.

240
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,140
(SCREAMS) I got in!

241
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,525
(GIGGLING EXCITEDLY) I got in!

242
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,861
Uh, honey, that's great,

243
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,988
but isn't Sarah Lawrence
on the other side of the country?

244
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,114
Thus the basis of its appeal.

245
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,407

246
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,701

going to stay here and go to school.

249
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,874
No, you decided.

250
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,252
Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up
and leave, is that it?

251
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,754
Let's hope so.

252
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,465
Ask Bianca who drove her home.

253
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,675
Kat, don't change the...
Drove? Who drove you home?

254
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,261
Now, don't get upset, Daddy,
but there's this boy...

255
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,097
- Who's a flaming imbecile.
- And I think he might ask me...

256
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,058
Please. I think I know
what he's going to ask you.

257
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,935
And I think I know the answer... No.
It's always no.

258
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,273
What are the two house rules?
Number one, no dating till you graduate.

259
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,109
Number two, no dating till you graduate.

260
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,112
- That's it.
- Daddy, that's so unfair.

261
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,199
All right, you want to know
what's unfair? This is for you, too.

262
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,577
This morning I delivered a set of twins
to a 15-year-old girl.

263
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,204
Do you know what she said to me?

264
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm a crack whore who should have

265
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,166
made my skeezy boyfriend
wear a condom?

266
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,629
Close, but no.

267
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,965
She said,
"I should have listened to my father."

268
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,593
- She did not.
- Well, that's what she would have said

269
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,553
if she wasn't so doped up.

270
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,057
Can we focus on me
for a second, please?

271
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,267
I am the only girl in school
who's not dating.

272
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,852
Oh, no, you're not.
Your sister doesn't date.

273
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,229
And I don't intend to.

274
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,939
And why is that again?

275
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,025
Have you seen the unwashed
miscreants that go to that school?

Old rule out. New rule, Bianca can date

282

when she does.

283
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,087
But she's a mutant!
What if she never dates?

284
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,339
Then you'll never date. Oh, I like that.

285
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,842

public break-up on the quad, again.

00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,390
Oh, yeah, um, okay.
I thought that we'd, um,

300
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,768
start with pronunciation,
if that's all right with you.

301

- Yeah, French food.

that your dad doesn't let you date,

that if it was for French class...

- Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...
- Cameron.

311
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,471

I can date when my sister does.

she's a little antisocial.

- Why is that?
- Unsolved mystery.

She used to be really popular,
and then it was like

319
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,619
she got sick of it or something.

320
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,954
Theories abound as to why,

321
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,040
but I'm pretty sure she's just
incapable of human interaction.

322
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,000
Plus, she's a bitch.

Him? No, don't...
Don't look at him, okay?

He's a criminal.
I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.

347

- He just did a year in San Quentin.
- Well, at least he's horny.

I don't know.

358
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,110
I mean, uh, we could pay him,

00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,822
but we don't have any money.

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,449

- Someone with money who's stupid.

- Well, actually, I thought

that I'd run an idea by you,
just to see if you're interested.

369

- I'm not.
- Well, hear me out.

Now, you want Bianca, right?

371
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,785
But she can't go out with you
because her sister

372
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,706
is this insane head case, and no one
will go out with her, right?

373

Does this conversation
have a purpose?

374
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,710
What I think you need to do,

375
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,838
is you need to hire a guy
who'll go out with her.

376

- I heard he ate a live duck once.
- Everything but the beak and feet.

- Now, Perky's. Perky's now.
- At the beginning of the shot.

1517
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:36,731
Perk... Oh.

1518
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:43,571
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr. Cuervo.

1519
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,491
Um, I'll see you around, okay?

1520
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,255
Don't worry. There's better for you,

1521
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,173
and it's right here.

1522
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,093
Come here.
No, I wanted you for so long.

1523
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,594
(CREW LAUGHING)

1524
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:10,932
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

1525
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,309
You and that little bitch.

1526
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:18,106
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

1527
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,445
What, are you kidding me?

1528
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,364
(BLEEPING)

1529
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:33,621
- I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.
- And it's my car.

1530
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,499
(SCREAMING)

1531
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,711
I want some coffee!

1532
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,310
Could I get a prophylactic?

1533
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,563
A prophylactic. Ah!

1534
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,483
- Let go!
- How could you set me up like that?

1535
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,402
Oh, God, I just wanted...

1536
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,571
To completely damage me,
send me to therapy forever?

1537
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,823
- Ow! No, I just wanted...
- Ladies.

1538
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,491
(WHIMPERING)

1539
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,740
- Shall we go to my office?
<i>- Tout de suite!</i>

1540
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,330
<i>Tout de suite!</i>

1541
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,583
Oh, my God!
